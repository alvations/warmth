Lack of snow on the mountains haunts the hotel owners
Scneelose Pisten Sorgenn make not only the giant mountains-local residents.
The lack of snow discourages people of appointment of the Skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions.
It can therefore in Giant still free room for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
The people go through the offers, the prices, but now they are afraid to cultivate binding.
And if they call us to ask them immediately, whether we believe that this year's Christmas on snow or "Matsch" will be led by the operators of the information Spindl.Info portal, Martin Jandura.
If you want to the New Year's Eve-stay in the Spindelmühle just after his ideas, should no longer hesitate with the appointment.
Anyone who prefers saving and the quality of the stay in second place, which can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners are now for the New Year's Eve day mostly only weeks stays.
I think that they will seek to sell them for a while, but then they must also give in, and for shorter times.
And then the free rooms quickly wane, Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates is always the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet sold off.
In our offer is about half the seats are still free.
That is why we have some cheaper Christmas stays prepared for the last moment, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvestertag in Giant can also offer the Vrchlabi-travel agency, but there are fewer free seats.
Good (also find the first 14 days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year is the interest for the winter were also negatively affected by that in giant is no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should be the Pisten within a week verschneit, will also be sold out this Christmas, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, manages to fill the room in the hotel horizon in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On Silvestertag and Christmas we have only a few free room.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in the Janua, and in February will run the business as well, the director of the best Pec hotels, Karel Rada.
With 80 percent for the New Year's Eve visits is also the hotel Omnia in Zentralparkplatz in Janske Lazne.
Remains to Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us in this year of January, for which we are currently occupied at around 60 percent.
A little weaker is now the February, but at the very moment when the snow comes, heightens the interest in the periods spent in Giant, the director of the Omnia hotels, Erik Sporysch.
On a more snow Mess wait the Giant hotel owners now.
On Thursday it should cool and if it comes to rainfall, should be the snow on the mountains.
But then again be a warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical, with which Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the issue of Afghanistan, which he considered himself for the Dümmsten.
When he finally his eagerly-awaited ausschwitzte Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he abschrieb this on the Kopierpapier from the Bush-Iraq Szenariovor three years ago.
Not only that, several times in the text itself, the phrase "as in Iraq", he has even used the name of the Bush statement of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "new way forward", used without hesitation.
He has even three years of the Bush idea - fresh troop contingents in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq - as "irresponsible and send in their conclusions karastrophische decision".
Subsequent months showed, however, that the recommendations of the military outgoing lands in the only way, and was very successful that it is now in the news about Iraq no longer.
Bush's reputation has not improved by objectively, because he has hintergelassen his successor a much dankbarere starting situation, as it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent have again asked the military, especially the Oberkommandeur the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten the vacillating - gunman harshly criticized in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better.
The President has three months, but with no better idea and he has the General wenistens cheated about 10,000 soldiers.
In Europe, he has Pressed the promise of another 5,000, even if he originally at least 10,000 expected.
Highly problematic about the whole Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process to be completed within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the cut increase in the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Also, despite the fratricidal war in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders pay tribute to the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the cons indication - you can rely on second and there are no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their minds.
The political institutions, even if they were founded formally correct, that leaves only bogus construction, behind which the patriarchal Stammbeziehungen will make further out.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions that the Pakistan and Iran influences even more complex.
The building of a "strong state", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan only worse and now it is on the brink of explosion.
To believe that the small soldiers in the war cries about the "early return" from ruptured a miracle, can only create a truly romantic soul, not influenced by facts.
From the political point of view is the date for the withdrawal of troops sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the combat in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians can and want their voters does not explain in what way the security of Germany or Italy , with the war in Iraq .
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work for the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem to be solved not with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama is the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that three years until the presidential election and, therefore, there is still enough time so that he can resort to a different strategy, fallls would prove this as a total loss.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs receive no Prämienboni more in cash
The chief executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will receive no bonuses this year more bonuses in cash.
The company has announced that responded to the sharp criticism of their pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers will instead of the money can sell shares, but only in five years.
In addition, the shares can be stripped of the managers in the case, if they act too risky.
Goldman Sachs is in accordance with the Reuters news agency at the forefront of efforts, the premium bonuses of Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on the further direction is aware, in which she has to go, the former banker of the society, Douglas Elliott, JPMorgan.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs itself was the target of criticism after it for the first three quarters of this year, almost 17 billion dollars for Prämienboni had set aside.
The total amount of bonuses bonuses in the course of this Jahra, according to the Reuters news agency will probably also indicated today despite the measure exceed $20 billion.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders has become the hottest political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of the bankers, the 25,000 pound exceed, unique with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.
This year, women have won the Nobel prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.

Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him in the Burg
President Vaclav Klaus on Friday morning, receives the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, about his continued presence in the government, because he thinks with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form of this by the Assembly was released on Wednesday, disagrees.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota cabinet the themes of the Friday meeting.
The budget will also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, as the crisis in public finances.
on the meeting of the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
On its future remain in his post wants Janota on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
After the budget-law, which is now receiving Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In Parliament were increased but on Wednesday, on the Left Party proposals on monetary upheaval and the money for the civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has the proposals of the social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and legal party, on the other hand, is therefore a sharp domestic political dispute, dessentwegen the question mark over the future work of the Fischer-pays official cabinet, on the organisation of the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget as it was approved by the Parliament, the package of savings virtually wiped out by the fischer- government have been imposed in the autumn, and that after their understanding of the national debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, must not, said today the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances, have neglected for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution.
An improvement could only a strong government, which is still on a broader consensus of the political parties could build.
The ods-vorsitzende, Mirek Topolanek, led to that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider their continued existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, said the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Grünenpartei apparently no longer works.
Premier Fischer described in the editorial similar words as a "strong Aussprüche."
The CSSD leader, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek said that the budget deficit is terrible, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and exceeds the 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday CSSD evaluated the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood shows-film "Invictus: The Ungeschlagene" of the world, much of the country from its fight and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, Rassenverhältnissen and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history of the American actor Oscar, Morgan Freeman,.
Freeman said that he was by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he could be in the eastwood- film.
A further important role Matt Damon.
I said to him: "If I play, I must take you.
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, the price for his role in the East Wood drama from the Boxbereich "million dollar baby" had received, the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which has become the slave owners, a fictional U.S. president, and also in "Evan Allmächtig ", but only rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was released in 1990 undfür four years he was President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is ungeschlagen the Latin word for "," and at the same time, this is the name of a Gedichtes of the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak as he
The film recounts a true story, the Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, leading to the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still rassenmäßig and economically.
He believes that he can agree people through sport, so he decides, the rugby players, the outsiders, in the world.
Finally, the South African team to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked several years to bring the Mandela-history on the cinema screen.
He had no objective other than to play this role so to Reconcile this as closely as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he has.
The actor said, if he and the world leaders would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, to eat with him and in his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I have noticed when I give you a hand schüttele, I accept your energy, they will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
For me, it is important to become a different person.
Matt Damon in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he Pienaar met for the first time in his house.
I remember when I rang the door bell, that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life, it was: 'in the film, I see a lot more '.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has led the director Eastwood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" received positive reviews and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "That was very good story, very well ausgeführter film."
In the film reviews on the Web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secrecy on Norway dissolved: the Russians have tested a missile
Norway was a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry has admitted that only yesterday near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
The launch was again not successful and as a type of "Bulava missile, which was originally called" the pride of the Russian army should be, is becoming a nightmare of Russian Generalität and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on the ground on the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not at all or were damaged in the air.
In the Russian media are already Talking about "Bulava" than a "missile, not Bound".
A missile, which flies, but do not
This is already 13 attempt, was at the beginning of normal.
Only at the end of the flight, in turn, technical damage to the missile.
Presumably the engine exploded in the third stage.
This time, "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij under the water of the White Sea.
This Raketentyp allows the firing from the submarine.
It is therefore likely that caused by an unspecified fliegendes object mysterious light on North because really damaged "Bulava was."
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The Generalität has diesesmal opposed and claims that it cannot properly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell not affected and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage.
Even if no test launch without mistakes, holds the chairmanship of the Ministry of Defence only six out of thirteen for unsuccessful.
The almost Combines success therefore meets the generals with optimism and it continues to claim that the "Bulava" fly without problems and even to ten Hyperschall-atomsprengköpfe with carry a weight of Max. 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov has signed with 51 years an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow
The legendary defensive players Vjaceslav Fetisov arises with 51 years in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup -Inhaber helps his team CSKA Moscow in the emergency, and is probably already in Freitagsduel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, his career with forty years ago, in 1998, has been completed, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need a further defensive players.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the agency quoted AP the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Now, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player just a game.
I think that Fetisov one of those who can raise the morale of other players, players Nemcinov.

Hyundai was the unions after all overtime will be lifted.
The management of the Nosovice car factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the lifting of all overtime.
Because often rely overtime, the union announced willingness to strike on Monday.
The spokesman confirmed the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
The management but wants to with the trade unionists even on a Saturday classes this week.
We must not abandon our production plan, which is a principle, was therefore on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime for the reason proposed that two working class would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company's staff, which would work Samstags class, offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
The staff also received after the event for the Saturday classes of 28 November.
Vanek, according to the company has decided to change the Motivierungsart of staff for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime pay or they can substitute for holidays on 28 December and extend the Christmas holidays, led Vanek.
In addition, all the staff of the Saturday class minibuses and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overtime is the most pressing and most burning issue in terms of demands and complaints of trade unionists were last week had stopped production, the management yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all the overtime for the month of December, Vank decided on.
The staff of the automobile factory until last week had been forced to virtually every day after the eight-hour class 2 overtime work.
After the signing of the agreement, the strike willingness on the part of the unions.
Weitereverhandlungen between the management of the car factory and the trade unionists are on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that, if they are to meet the demands of some and can sign a joint document that they are prepared to lift the strike.
The situation in the car factory has deteriorated last week, on Wednesday, approximately 400 employees spontaneously for permanent overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The board felt that the staff overtime to comply with the car supply needs.
The trade unionists in ihremmontags-streikbereitschaftsausrufung also demanded that the staff at the last Wednesday the production have interrupted, with no penalties are imposed.
In the field of overtime call for the trade unions, the überstundenarbeit to reduce to a minimum.
In addition, they are calling for this year to pay the salary of 5000 kroner.

The routine was in the company launched in November last year.
Until this September have approximately 80,000 vehicles manufactured, the current manufacturing capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance, which is also in 'like' HIV viruses works
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds designed to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also in the viruses, which are resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs against the disadvantage that the link to normal virus-variants not as strong as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured.
The patients, the medication compilation but can prolong the lives and prevent the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
Their use is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete oppression of the viral reproduction also has the development sg. Resistent viruses result against no medicines are more effective.
The work of the experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (chemically-Technological High School) Prague, from the University of Heidelberg opens the way of how to deal with the virus-resistant.
They have proven that as Metalokarborane substances on the protein substance, which is responsible for the expansion of HIV Viruses.
The Metalokarborane are links from Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus reproduction in other ways than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists to new ´ improved ´ links, on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their attachment to the virus protein material were prepared.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from Bor -, hydrogen and carbon atoms, and through a metal atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
Heinous and constant virus
HIV Protease is protein material of the HIV virus, which for the life cycle of the virus is essential.
Without the HIV Protease caused by the HIV virus division would not Infektionsvirenpartikel mature.
If we eliminate the HIV Protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients from, say the scientists in the press report, by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work in the Science paper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry was published, the scientists describe all ranks of the compounds, in which two couples the cages (see table) by a brief organic chain are linked, then further changed systematically.
A weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV-Protease wurdne tested in Reagenzglas, even against their steady (resistant) variations which were won by HIV-infected patients.
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as the clinically used medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the Resistentvarianten, against which the medicines are often ineffective.
The unique impact mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical ways, makes the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further on the development of effective medicines against HIV applied research, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute for molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to fishermen, the Fights Back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his view, consider their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the Prime Minister as a "strong Aussprüche."
It is time for the analysis.
The deputy ODS-chair, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Staff cabinet with the support of the CSSD ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
After the Prime Minister Necas must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament, when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it, in order to remain in office through the Parliament left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to depart, Necas pointed out.
Parliament has on Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with linkpartei-änderungsvorschlägen on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has concealed the proposals of the social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the provisional budget. Frase not clear
Frustration and futility
The finance minister Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government assess the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if Janota seriously with his resignation in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech Television has registered Janota on Monday after the government business in the Premier.
He has indicated that he thought to remain in office.
The reason is his disappointment on the Verhandugn of the budget.
To what extent fishermen for the continued battle with the budget deficit, so that, in accordance with the Necas Nominanten the Social Democrats (CSSD), the changes in the budget had nothing to do in the government.
The Premier should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament adopts continue to deficit-boosting laws, for example, sick pay and pensions or the service laws should be changed.
Topolanek: the ODS nominated ministers were proved wrong not
This is a matter for the Prime Minister, fishermen and the government.
The ODS nominated ministers have not made mistakes, Topolanek said in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function people who subscribe to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen in favour decides to give up the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority, which is now in Parliament".
Then he can count allegedly with the support and tolerance of the citizens of Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it will be, then I will deal with it, said of the citizens of Democrats nominated Defence Minister Martin Bartak journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came at the request of the Prime Minister back
Necas said at the same time that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the Premier Members of the citizens of Democrats would explicitly ask that you allow the adoption of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the leader of the party in Parliament, and in the Czech Republic has not diminished.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
Even when I dropped to the mandate, I knew that in coming months, especially at Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction of all positive, would react, Topolanek itself.
After the new road map of the CD (Czech railways) will drive less trains for roughly the same fare.
The Czech Railways stopped or restricted from 13 December some less closing its rapid and local trains, other links will be strengthened.
The entire transport volume will be reduced from the day of the new road map compared with today at two percent.
Most tariffs incl. Basic and Kundenfahrtarif will not be changed.
Several liaison possibilities in the capital, for example, the residents of Ostrava area, the railways for this line trains of the type Pendolino.
The train will no longer be Bratislava (former Pressburg).
Less fast trains are also on the route Prague - Pisek - drive Budweis, in principle, the direct links from Prague to Letohrad.
The biggest reduction in the railways in the district of Hradec Kralove (King Graz), an of eight percent, to an increase in Prague and environment.
Be lifted two night trains on the route Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on some days in the week of the operation of some fast trains on the route Prague - Pisek - reduced Budweis.
The biggest changes include the introduction of the new Direktverkehrsweges from Milovice to Prague, at the moment, the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of suburban transport system Esko, whose opening thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem after Milovice is possible.
The long-distance routes in the capital will end in the target station Prague - main railway station.
The CD introduces more lines sc pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains after sumperk / jesenik in the space of two hours.
With the Pendolino the passengers since 13 December can no longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for regional railways: increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Transport Department, overall, the railway to reimburse the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, receives four billion kronor, how has this year. The local trains supply the districts, overall they pay in next year, eight billion kronor, while the state zuschießt three billion.
This year, the regional trains 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains and the fast trains has completed the railways a ten-year contract, until now the Treaty was just completed for one year.
The railway praises the system, it is not to the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
To changes, it is only in one-day netzfahrscheinen CD net and favourable internetfahrscheinen eliska.
For passengers without the customer card will increase the price CD web of 450 kroner to 600 kronor.
The price eliska will then depend on the gefahrenen pro-enlargement until now, he was for the trip between any bezirkstädten uniform and cost 160 kroner.
Philippine Millitante take more than 50 people, the children have been released.
Millitante hijacked today in the south of the Philippines 75 people, including some primary school pupils and their teachers.
This has led the AFP agency, which was originally only about 65 abducted informed.

Jancura collects complaint for libel against three head of the CSSD.
The owner of the student Agency, Radim Jancura, collects today for libel cases against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of southern Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen Inteview on radio Journal.
The complaint is connected with the effort of the company, the regional trains in some districts.
All regions have signed but ultimately the long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three managers are attacking us and say that we could remove the cherries, we have tabled the offer only on the size, as it voted with them.
They claim that we are expensive as the Czech railways, because we know the price of the Czech railways were completed last week.
So we have no other option but to defend ourselves.
Because of this defamation of society student Agency, said Jancura radio Journal.
At the same time, he gave was that he has evidence from all districts that they have made their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek keeps the collection of the complaint for the continuation of the Medial ploy by Jancura him as free advertising for his company and for his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good name and reputation in my district, and I would urge other head on.
I assume that this matter will be clear that it is Jan Cura, in the matter of the regional scrapheap rail manipulated the public and used false and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million kroner in the advertisement, which will highlight the damaging step of districts.
The radio Journal, he said that he cut off the campaign after Christmas, and wants to continue this after the New Year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign has launched Jancura after the wards at the behest of the regional rail transport agreed with the Czech railways and for the task in a High 150 billion kronor had no invitations to tender.
After Vancura such behaviour is illegal and incompatible with the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the movement of trains in the districts threatened him, according to Jancura, already a Member of the CSSD.
The only threat was, if we do that we can also lose the Buslizenzen.
He was as a member of the CSSD before, I know who it is, I am not saying his name, said Jancura Radio Journal today.
Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and voluntarily
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January the usual.
It is a first for the families free and voluntary.
But now voices that the duty-vaccination report would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Pneumokokken culminate.
The medicine institute already sets the maximum price of the vaccines, which have to pay for health insurance.
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure in the clear.
New vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August children
From January children can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken free of charge on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition st that they have not received any Impfdosis.
Anyone who has begun with the vaccination in the last year or earlier, must also pay weitereWiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first Impfdosis must be made between 3 and 5 living month of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families to vaccinate their children against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses required.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the quantities 300,000 to 450,000 kronor per year.
They save but in the treatment of the children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state for all land vaccination of children spent around $500,000 per year.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumokokken cause Mittelohrentzündung, but also serious infections including Gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning.
By pneumokokkeninfektionen die with us after investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic was the duty-vaccination of children against Pneumokokken introduced in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be duty?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccine could be compulsory in the future.
From January to paid by the insurance and be voluntary.
That the compulsory vaccination would be mentioned, for example, the head of the citizens association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association already in the long term for the Pneumokokken vaccination.
The experts at the international conference in which our group was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded, at least.
I believe that this is the way we must go now, Kalovsky.
The Department of Health will but the vaccination procedure against Pneumokokken not change.
At this moment, we are considering not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say the doctors.
The chairman of the society of practical Kinderärzten, Hana Cabrnochova, too, that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then we could reflect on the reduction of Wiederholungsimpfungszahl "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was voluntary," says allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of the parents their infants against Pneumokokken inoculated from next year.
The vaccination against Pneumokokken is Groundbreaking, is that this is the first Flächenimpfung paid by the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance should spend the money for prevention, so that they save for further treatment, erkärt Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
So that is a concern of the practical paediatricians, the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial project the vaccines should be available by the insurance companies and doctors this on the same road, as well as other vaccines by the state to spend it.
Some Members but feared that the insurance so "the money from the health care could lead."
That is why the doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and have to wait until the insurance pay for them.
According to the estimates the individual practical doctors must invest 40 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.

Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters for a ban on building voted for minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, a thorough and thoughtful report written about it, whether Muslims in one of the avowedly secular societies can be integrated Europe -- and be integrated.
Some readers of this new book from admiration for the last station of the author: "why the French love no scarves" (original title: "why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006) read an elegant and densely argumentierenden study a contentious issue, which divided the country about one and a half decades and employed and whose effects are still visible.
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum.
As a good anthropologist he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and colleges, which are now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic free" offer.
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should marry a Muslim in a mosque or a City Hall (or both)?
Should be lectured young Muslims about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim, to use a zinsorientiertes banking system, in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane matters, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political dramas, the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known names, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a born in Switzerland Arabic Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible, on the one hand, a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists interviewed Bowen, are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts – supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam with Saudi Arabia in – nowadays a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
He is questioning whether French political leaders (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state watches) really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism.
He sees more of a "tightening of values" as a growing pragmatism.
The Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "yes, but not yet."
The trostloseste outlook of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate and takes life that can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, schifffahrts- and fishing interests in the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers, and now also authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and Illustrator, in "on thin ice" (original title: "on Thin Ice"), a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bears.
familiar in the complex history and politics of the whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arktiser researchers who have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelsons encounter with a polar bears as a brave 14-year-old Fähnrich sea, only with the rifle musket-shape fought, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
Young bears, which, as they have been caught behind the bodies of their recently schwammen mothers, were killed in zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears in a vision.
Even today Zooanlagen typically still have a million thirtieth of the living area of a wild Alttiers. The climate is rarely appropriate: The Eisbär in Singapore was quite green of the algae that grow in the hollow hair of his skin.

Ironically, in the waters in the north of this two hunting nations the ice longest remain.
In his new book "After the ice" (original title "After the ICE") offers Alun Anderson, a former editor of Science magazine "New Scientist," a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packenden insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.

But, starting with the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in ice, all of them are threatened, once the summer ice, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months we could be the"...
Marines were among the 6,000, the Arlington placed wreaths laid down
The Obergefreite De 'Angello Robinson went seven hours by bus to a single wreath at the grave of a soldier, he had never met.
For him and the other marines, what the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the national cemetery in Arlington, to companies to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women, in whose footsteps they entered.
In a few months, from where we are returned, we could be, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we do, I would hope that someone would do the same for me, so I am trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning, placed wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, holder of the Trauerkranzherstellers Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, established in 1992 this tradition, as he and some other firm, several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington to dekorieren.
It is now a 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, which make this trip each year, in various cities along the road to hold events, the people in the military and are dedicated to victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (placed wreaths across America), the event has also extended to other states.
In this year, more than 16000 volunteers placed wreaths on the graves at the Arlington cemetery in areas at the Pentagon on graves of National cemetery Fayette Ville in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York and at the memory site for United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation has donated for the second time, more than 150,000 dollars for purchase and transport of placed wreaths.
Char Leen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she has made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldiers.
Although her husband is buried in Arlington, said Hunt, this is their way to give something back to the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution, as we can support our soldiers, civilians.
It is as if the visit of a family Grabstätte.
Were wrapped in warmer clothing the volunteers across the vast rasenflächen and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers were older graves from the 1th and 2th World War and the Vietnam War as an objective, since these are not as often as the newer graves, the organisers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held in the hand, while the fresh pine branches to the grey of grave stones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon, the upper part was attached.
The Section 60, which is in the vicinity and where veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations cheered 1,000 placed wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individual wept openly, others prayed and families and friends kept each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names in stone since before, during hinabbeugten others to small black and white place cards that had been set for those in the wet mud, whose tombstones were not yet ready.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who was crying before the grave of her son bitter tears.

The US government contractors by Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has a contractor for the US government, mobile phones and notebook computers sold in the country, arrested, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The contractor, which until now has not yet been identified, is working for Development alternative, Inc. with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Konsularbeamte the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban right a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, under the charge of 'risk' can be arrested.
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, the easy protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has pursued a growing bloggers-community, led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband by government representatives and being attacked.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractors will probably increase the tension between the communist government of Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is a "slow" had sought rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first Friday night by the New York Times reported.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban Government concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legally in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of government officials $15 per month.
The Cuban government only allows ordinary citizens since this year the purchase of a mobile phone, they are used skin irrelevant for the sending of text messages, since a 15-minütiges telephone conversation would cost a daily wage.
The use of the Internet is on the island of extremely limited.
It is in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and some government agencies, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to connect, often the government must notify their names.
Too many websites access is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American rare.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba are in prison, sit behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, press spokesman for the US representation in Havana.
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that is legal in any other free society legally - the levy free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently a harsh report on the freedom in Cuba, with the title "new Castro, Cuba ", an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as leader of the country, the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants very often within a day were arrested, tried and imprisoned.
He said that probably any solution would be politically and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when both countries for greater willingness to engage in dialogue move closer together.
Pakistani government officials meet plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at five men from northern Virginia to send to Afghanistan in order to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope the case could help an extensive network of terrorist recruitment agencies to identify the Internet after absuchen radicalised young men.
Investigators have said that they have a murky insurgents, known as Saifullah, had sought the men had been invited to Pakistan after he had found, because one of them on the Internet video side YouTube made favourably inclined to terrorist attacks.
Saifullah after their arrival in Pakistan of the leaders of these men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was briefed on the matter said on Saturday, Saifullah was not the Al-Qaeda leader that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held on days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north-west, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and still trying to get the right recommendations in order to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of five men - which remains in Pakistan are and will be interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of recruiters in the identification of future terrorists and perhaps even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the us-geheimdienst to a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda.
The recruitment agencies of the organisation as pförtner, those not let, whose commitment to the holy war not seriously enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits A Qaeda by a specific test, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to US objectives and its propaganda value, but they are also regarded as incredibly attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years has also become much more cautious in regard to whom to allow access, because the US intelligence experts are their recruitment methods.
If you try to follow anyone in these groups, what better way could go as the recruitment model, which so many have already followed?, Kohl said.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate "Action"
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the bella-kongresszentrum the city kühneres action on climate change.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25,000.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small explosive devices in the vicinity of some government buildings in the inner city burned.
On a day when the promoted by the UN climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with transparent through the city, which was in English, "there is no planet B" and one in Spanish, the declared "the world says" enough ".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the native country of their mother, their awareness of the heart-rending problems the country because of the already significant effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the large demonstration - to pass the floor and appeal to the world to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way that the games.
The police, the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either hooded or pocket knife with.
According to Danish law, these actions during demonstrations banned.
According to a viewer, who do not wish to be named because he is involved in the negotiations on climate change, masked demonstrators burned in black clothes several explosive devices in the vicinity of the Copenhagen Hauptkanals, near where several ministries.
They threw it in the vicinity of the buildings, he said and added that it began as a Leuchtraketen, but then followed by "a couple of big explosions".
In the kongresszentrums assembled the people on television screens in the afternoon the demonstration.
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator, apparently not.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration had a positive effect on the international considerations, he replied in English: "that is something of which I was not aware of."
He then in Mandarin and said: "Because of the venue is great, I can hear what is happening out there."
He stated that it is from the perspective of the individual on whether the demonstration would help or hurt.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "we can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent racial divide
The certificates to mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the District of Washington still far behind the schools of the country, the maximum benefits, the records show that the Viert and Achtklässler in the last two years faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But what in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP) is included, is the persistent achievement gap between African-American and white pupils, both at local and National level.
The average score of the White ViertkläSsler from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years of 262 on 270 (on a scale of 500), their African-American counterparts, but only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained basically the same, he fell a statistically negligible point of 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough.
The picture over a six-year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 Skalenpunkte (262 to 202).
And although the item number, the children of both groups have achieved in that time has grown, the difference with 58 points now barely decreased.
Some education advocates of the southern last week expressed their concern that the results of schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty celebrated, for the most part of white pupils who are already strong children.
This suggests that we have increased the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is complicated and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for the educational equality in Washington D.C..
I springe not for a span of two or three points, and Lower, said the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton-primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of the Prüfungspunktzahlen is that the secondary schools in the city urgently need attention.
Of course we would always see the positive signs, which I respect.
What frightens me, however, is that we do not spend approximately the time and energy that we need to stand up for our middle school.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the current weak pupils.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained, a new reading curriculum that Wilson reading system to use aimed at pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, which basic skills of reading have not at the beginning of their school career and the significantly behind their young counterparts classes comrades.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to class for the sixth games and lebensechte experience in the foreground, under the former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey brought to Washington and this curriculum are some of the NAEP progress, were reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils benefit below the central level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the performance of the system and will provide the extra money and resources for the leistungsschwachen schools, which are necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, studied the urban audit results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms at the schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could create political fallout that work against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors that they tried to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We must strengthen our schools in the districts, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance gap is the traditional public school year, which is currently in Washington to extend 180 days, in order to compete with the charter schools.
We must increase the school year to nearly 200 days, in order to have the power to change, said Janey who, with his teachers' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the road to a larger increase in the next Treaty.
Higher education for more people than a future

Their attitude and the other AchtkläSsler the group, explore the Gettysburg, where the teaching costs 38.690 dollars per year, was a reverence full visitor, rather than the future of enthusiastic students.
"Yes, I will soon be here!" called Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they had now entering the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" said they thought, as the low teacher-to-student ratio of the school has been reported.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh, the children have visited on their three-day tour and now they have the intended message completely: the question is not whether it's College.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants do not end the High School or as a pregnant teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands, the college education is needed to aufzu in the middle class.
In truth, includes one in five of these "second generation" of Hispanic Americans, the college – which is a remarkable achievement, because many of their immigrierten parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States, without the completed High School.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the labor force in the country, show the way forward.
Those who study powerful children, say these often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent impetus to success.
Many of them also have parents who give their children set high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advisory programmes also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to get in college, especially if these efforts over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in the Wegsuche through the system, it will be a single measure at any time not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, who hispanoamerikanische students studied.
We need to think about it, for these children a supporting network of pre-school up through the High School.
The federal program that Gracielas had financed college tour, is a useful example.
It is known as Gear up - a date hochschalten - and provides more than $300 million per year for local school systems available to college preparation programs to launch the start, if low-income students in the middle school and continue until they have completed the High school.
According to the US Department of Education has helped the programme since 1999, more than 10 million students, of which more than 60% in college.
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies from
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government on Saturday completed auctions in two major oil companies can lead to rebuild its damaged infrastructure.
The 10 contracts with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ölministeriums suggests that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies have only shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid, has drawn the short straw.
Two American companies have been able to conclude contracts for versteigerte fields in June.
The sparsely gesäten representatives of American valued in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of US companies give Asian and European the path, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq.
Security concerns were highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the US military held American oil companies from likely, analysts said to do more in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
US companies were in some cases, because competitors, particularly the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, significantly lower wage costs and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies, have been able to conclude the contracts with the ministry.
Major US companies, such as forcing Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which with the Iraqi oil ministry close relations and in recent years with technical advice, are empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has for more contracts, than any other companies and with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home.
We all know, said the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad that China is on the way, one of the big countries of the world economy, as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company with its Mitbietern can and will Fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
For the commandment levy vorausgewählte companies gave commandments, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, the ministry was willing to pay to address each Felds to increase beyond the current level.
Top designer of Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US anti-missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan this week to a top Einsatzplaner of Al Qaeda, have been killed, representatives of the US Terrorismusbekämpfung reported on Friday.
This would be, if it would confirm the second deadly attack on a senior leaders of the terrorist organisation in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities representatives of the region by a number of missiles have been killed, which met on Tuesday their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a Drohnentyp, which is used by the CIA in the lawless tribal belt of Pakistan.
They drove in a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, as the car was taken, said an agency representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah by telephone.
Local residents who are suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the site and quickly took everything, what is left of the "completely destroyed ".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US-led fight against terrorism an unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as the leading military planners of Al Qaeda, the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in plots around the world, said a senior official, who wanted to remain anonymous, and the sensitive nature of the American air attacks on Pakistani soil. referred
If one adopts its central role as a given, it also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took up strategic instructions from the Topführern of Al Qaeda and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American authorities representative said that Somali quickly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and best compounds used to other extremist groups in the region.
He may be known to some Americans, said the second civic leaders, but this reduces the threat he was for us and our allies.
If confirmed, his death would be the second leading Somalis Al Qaeda or Taliban leader who was killed since September, as in a similar attack Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other Topaktivisten were killed.
The pace of attacks by drones of the CIA since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, one of a nonprofit website, outrageously, by an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups, have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and, at the same time, in the suspected informers brutally kill, reported in the side.
Senior UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The top UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, which would end a stormy tenure, supported by the UN the allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election has been tarnished.
oath lost, as the Obama administration has decided to send a further 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the fact that the US timetable for the military withdrawal, which is expected to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help with the political changeover of Afghanistan.
The troop increase on the military side must meet an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he does not resign his office, but only one in March 2008 for his family to grant agreement, only two years to remain in Kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification of UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now, so that he had time for a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to seek a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a zweimonatiges vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban, in accordance with UN representatives started the search for a replacement.
The UN officials say that the Swedish-Italy-descended Staffan di Mistura, who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, the previous UN peacekeeping operations has taken into consideration.
oath position in Afghanistan has been put to the test, after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, "of the mission have undoubtedly damaged, because it is already a great deal of scepticism about the international interference in the election was".
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged that allows the U.N. leadership to his successor, more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate for the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment on the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment rules have undermined its ability to bring capable people.
The UN rules are such that I since May, he said, only one person was able to stop.
This is disastrous and must not continue.
US Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers soon "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he was not in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a seven-day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran are no good options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"one of the things I to the soul, is, if we in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war own Unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package, aimed at the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "in order to convince the Iranian government that it is protected with nuclear weapons, in reality, less" because "their people tremendously" suffering from the sanctions.
On Friday, has joined in an opinion by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government, the European leaders in the warning that Iran must reckon with "credible" consequences if it complies with its nuclear program to the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear-monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes to be won.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks to curb its nuclear programme and an essential part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for a medical research reactor would forgo.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
Iran appears to have but since that time, the negotiations on the interim agreement to leave, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
That Iran the international community with regard to some of the proposals, which they had already agreed at the beginning of October, simply left, has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way, as you brought in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran were never said gates.
President Obama has set the 31 Dez. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he other options, including the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions" will continue to follow.
In a statement issued in New York has condemned the Iranian representative at the United Nations, which it on Thursday, "gratuitous and unfundierte allegations" of some Security Council members called on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, the last Friday should return to Washington, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq meeting with the soldier in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities representatives in Irbil.
The tension between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays of US plans, the American troop strength by the end of August by 115 000 to 50,000.
Gates also sought the Kurdish concern about the forthcoming troop withdrawal. The US quoted Gates, Masood Barzani, the president of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will take your security, your well-being and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of direction in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew surrounded by propaganda posters on them lectures that "mother earth is too tired to talk to other children" and "A baby more means one more tomb".
These lessons they have learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai by the low birth rate and the ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples ermunterten, more than to have a child, their response was immediate and definitive: "in no case."
We already have all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled individual children, who affectionately called "little emperors", has produced a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN is.
Department for population issues, while the number of population of 60 years and older in 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 to 31.1 percent rise exponentially. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger.
Last year have 60-jährige and older almost 22 percent of reported residents identified Shanghai, while the birth rate of one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai city population and family planning Commission has said that couples should receive normal reproductive age babies, "in order to help to reduce the relationship of the ageing population and to alleviate the labour shortage in the future ".
Shanghai will soon "as old -- but not as rich as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy would be the most controversial disposal, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples who are against this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- triple up on her annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed this policy that the critical financial pressure on the natural land resources could be avoided, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials pregnant women who have already had a child, forced to Abzutreiben.
Many couples have had geschlechtsselektive abortions, and take an unnatural high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for population gradually their position on the one-child policy weakened.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers and members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder -- and 2007 was moderated by the tone of many hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing said that government officials recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, couples to allow two children, in which a Einzelkind partner.
Shanghai was in July for the first Chinese city, which has launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
posters, the families Belehrten, only to have a child, have been replaced almost overnight of directives, which describe in detail, who qualify for a second child and how we can apply for approval.
The city government has urban employees and volunteers for family planning to couples sent home and information sheets out under the doors.
They also asked about, psychological and financial advice for the available, which have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing response
Although officials from a rural town in the external sector of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications of couples to recognize is that after the launch of the campaign to a second child, the urban districts reported against any change.
In the Huinan municipality with a population of 115 000 than example still per month, only four or five requests.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city despite the campaign are still around 165.000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipal Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give her first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and it is also legally allowed.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance to the government.
Without a social network, they say, that decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West are assessing the one-child policy as the human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife in the seventh month, is pregnant with her first child.
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples be psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the personnel chief, said that they would like to just one child, because it was also an Einzelkind. "we were the centre of the family and that everyone around us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and do not want this. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 -year-old, a translation company, said it plain.
For parents from the middle class with dual career, through which the birth rate is falling, he said, it is to be successful and we must be selfish.
The age group of 20 - to 39-year-old grew so that their parents during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment to see and does not want a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, is huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must abandon their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the question -- "we must rebuild his home" -- and the life planning -- "if the child is 9 months old, we already have a CV to offer the best nursery schools."
Most of his friends are ready, this is a time, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first has achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to too many victims.
UN group plan to reduce emissions
The by the United Nations-sponsored conference on climate change -- until now by wild posturing and mutual accusations had -- on Friday with the publication of a document, a priority for the next 40 years, recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, the industrialised nations in the near future would have to shoulder the biggest burden.
The text, which is the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could provide, has both the remaining obstacles, as also shown the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was created by a special UN working group has been formulated, is silent on the amount of money from the rich countries to poor countries should be short and long term, so that they can deal with global warming.
He also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how industrial and big emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature should be, the political decision-makers.
The process will be given a great deal of flexibility, so John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has six pages of the document, has drafted a 180 pages long negotiating text, with the focus on what the leading climate representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, as "the big picture."
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 2020 to 25 to 45 percent, compared with the levels of 1990, would cut, while major developing countries were to reduce their emissions in the same period of 15 to 30 percent.
Together the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European community has the talks on Friday a boost by their assurance, over the next three years, 3.6 billion dollars per year, in order to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from maestros of floods and droughts by avoiding deforestation.
The Friday expressed the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the last week.
The U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected wordings binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand if they are not funded by the industrialized nations.
This train has announced that the Obama administration a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration not even two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement, without major emerging countries stand up and take measures, Stern, who also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern issued its opinion one hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, which meant that it feels the leading US climate negotiator either of "common sense" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said earlier this week that the United States, China would not help financially to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging countries opened up fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers to fight, who bear the costs of slowing down of the greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have begun to act more aggressively, the countries with very high greenhouse gas levy for their deeds to account.
It is clear that this is a game, which will develop a new economic domination, Ulate, who is also a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the impact of climate change, said that they continue to a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen would fight, although the leading participants say that the talks in the best case scenario will lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on early Friday morning presented a 24 page draft treaty.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states, "exerting political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the open questions before the arrival of the government leaders must be resolved in order to reach an agreement.
Senior officials, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister entstiegen their aircraft and belonging through the corridors of the Bellacruz centres meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, claims to be negotiated during the next week.
The sheer scale of the Assembly - 13,000 people, daily in Congress Centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold late-night comedy shows, where they make fun of the countries who betrayed and sell, and draft treaty passed from hand to hand rather than by E Mail - is already a challenge.
The intensity builds just: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km / h speed train defines the Monday feeling newly
Monday morning at 5 a. m., 13 will penetrate a pipe penetrate the darkness to announce a Zugabfahrt, which represents a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country in its lightning journey from Ashfort, Kent, after London St Pancras 225 km / h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
With Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will then lady Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin Pendlerservices from London.
He hopes that the new service Britain finally to an international rail network ankoppeln faster, more reliable trains and the major urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland will permit in London.
The neglected province could be vibrant commuter towns, Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the exchange of plane and car to train the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main parties in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds, which for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning slaughter and fears about environmental damage in the British Hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen could still applying the brakes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, the government will present a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 December.
This gives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, linking London with the West Midlands, will pass with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment are controversial.
The free site is the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
Hs2 should also three options for a larger, northwards leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a y-förmige route, in which a single high-speed link in the West Midlands.
The route would share in or near Birmingham and an Abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of North East after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the most viable option," said a rail insider.
After the completion of the journey time between London and Edinburgh reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travellers, the London-Birmingham stretch in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour to go.
The proposals would offer the possibility of the trains with a speed of 400 km / h, thereby the British rail network would be the quickest Europe.
The first route was planned for 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people able to travel.
Up to 18 trains per hour could on the London birmingham in operation.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be necessary on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be it.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to include the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston this potential.
Lord Adonis will know whether this plan, in his view, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public advisory and planning measures mean that a final decision will be made only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines on existing rail routes in the north of Birmingham, making the journey times between London and Scotland remain in about three hours.
This is regarded as a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be ensured a beacon for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers are eligible for mortgages for 75,000 pounds Orangerie across a Conservative on
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative member of the house of Commons, has asked the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an Orangerie across in which he himself in his house in his constituency build deported.
The prison spokesman for the party, which was downgraded by David Cameron because he complained that House of Commons members' of lean Rationen must "live, has increased its mortgage at 75,000 pounds to build a Eichenholz-skilled factory farming on his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to pay the taxpayer the extra interest on a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House of Commons the applications were approved at the time and they were not challenged by Sir Thomas Legg, of carrying out a review of the expenditure of the House of Commons members. Last night Duncan said that the "not even cleaner or more comprehensible, ".
Duncan, one of the richest unterhausmitglieder, has a zweistöckiges house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
In the nearby houses have reached a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, residential and Esszimmer, but the Fees Office, a spending control centre of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he has grown a winter nursery in the plans as "Orangerie. '
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was also asked during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the committee on standards and privileges to take on the increased money reception.
The committee has him last month after an investigation into his expenses by the breach of the rules.
2004, Duncan security for a mortgage on 271.406 pounds (300,000 euros) of his London house on his constituency home, which he transferred in 1991, a year before his election as Member of Parliament, had bought.
This week released documents show that Duncan until March last year around 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as hypothekenzins refund.
In April, its claims to more than 1 800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The rate of Duncans RBS-mortgage has not changed during this time, which suggests that the overall increase in funding the borrowing of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal stufenlose rbs-hypothekenzins fell from 7,94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, where he is still standing.
The latest by the House of Commons memos show that Duncan in this may continue to be entitled to 1.250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month.
Duncan lost his job in September as the opposition leader of the House of Commons, after a Undercover-reporter filming him when he said after the expenses scandal that MPs "of lean Rationen would" live.
"Essentially means, if it works for the state that one must live by meagre rations and how S * * * * * e."
He said: "I have spent my money for my garden and entitled to a tiny part of what is measured.
And I would call for the whole damn sum, but I do not do it. "
The Member, millionaire from his former career as Ölgroßhändler, was attacked in May because of its expenditure for the first time, when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he had checked with the fees office that this could be considered "excessive demand".
An activist has dug in protest in Duncans lawn a hole in the form of a £mark, after it became known that he over three years, 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros).
Last night, when he was asked about the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "This was both by the fees office, as well as following has been approved by Legg to value increase."
He added: "There is no debate about branching out and Durchschlängeln or a Verbiegen the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and is strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be clean and clear. "

Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over the UDF Siegel, because he is of the opinion that François Bayrou would not be worthy of this political legacy to defend after he would have done the left hand.
The defence minister, whose party partner of the UMP is, incidentally, wanted this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
On the strength of his efforts, he had the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now in NC), a claim to the property of the trademark UDF, since he was the first this brand 2004 'national institute de la propriété industrial "has asked for.
However, the office of François Bayrou's friends supervised parties alliance UDF's silence and clearly gave us to understand that they are not expropriate, and the ministers and MPs under threat of prosecution a deadline, this code is no longer to use and her to transfer the property rights of the brand.
They have made in the last few days many statements that you would suggest your political movement, the UDF Siegelzu + +, wrote the parties alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party MoDem and Senator Jean Arthuis of centrist alliance.
They also believed to be possible you would have the right to the name of this movement + Nouveau centre +, the slogans + today's UDF +, on their political material, as well as the starting side of your website.
As you know, you have no right to the use of this mark, said the secretariat of the UDF and calls on the NC party to remove "immediately the mention of the name UDF of sämtlichem material and (their) website."
They demanded by Mr Hervé de Charette "to the property rights of the trademark of their legal Anspruchsberechtigen ".
If they refuse, we will take action against them, in order to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, warned the undersigned.
In their letter they stress that "UDF" since 1978 a fully-fledged political movement and remind you that Morin and his friends "have taken the election" to leave these 2007 to start a competing movement, as it had already done other in 2002, the party "UMP ".
The party Nouveau centre has, therefore, the undersigned, no rights, the UDF Siegel (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to remind you that the last congress of the UDF 2007 three-year entry into the party modem and the creation of a secretariat to defend "the material and moral interests" of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing formed movement, has adopted.
What Mr Hervé de Charette, the secretariat, "he was at the time, as he has requested the brand name, for three years, no longer a member of the UDF," but the UMP.
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent manner, the absence of the deposit of the Akronyms UDF to carry out this for themselves.
You also have to remember that this is recklessness on the best ways to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC): "It seems to us, but in politics as in life would be full to make a name for themselves, instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by they appropriate, of a name that has no legal rights."
Affair Liliane beds Court: François-Marie Banier is convicted for exploitation of weakness
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to assess the artist François-Marie Banier, to determine whether he, as the daughter of Milliardärin Liliane beds Court claims a weak moment of Achtzig years has exploited in order to secure a portion of their assets.
The 62-jährige photographer, who is known for his Starfotos, on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness before trial, a criminal offence, with a maximum of three years ’ imprisonment and a fine of EUR 375.000 Punished.
This decision means that in fact a process in this affair will be the saga of one of the richest families of France, is worthy of mother and daughter snatches and at the same time the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal in the hand.
Equally, however, ordered the 15th criminal division a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane beds Court, which will be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among, during the investigation of the public prosecutor of Nanterre's conditions.
On Friday appointed doctors before 10 March 2010 to present a report in which you clearly announce whether and at what times Liliane beds Court could have found in a state of weakness.
I think they will undergo these investigations.
I will speak with her, said the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, me Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
What the lawyer by Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will show that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which must be protected, he reiterated.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane beds Court a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and Allroundkünstler, and accused him of the weakness of their mother for years to have exploited in order to secure grants totalling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For its part, has refuted Liliane beds Court has always been manipulated by the photographers, which she sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt - Meyer initiated proceedings would have to check the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.
So the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt on three of its Klientin of their lawyer sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that the husband of Françoise Mehr Distrusted.
According to her lawyer Liliane beds Court the following: "could you please explain to my daughter that I fifteen years, until twice a day to Banier wrote.
Françoise, I have since their marriage never more ".
The public prosecutor of Nanterre is again of the opinion that the Klägerin had no right to respond, especially because a guardianship judge in recent days has rejected their request, a judicial protection to initiate proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully Rechtsfähig is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf, " reaffirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme beds Court-Meyers has taken place.
Managers revolution or the end of the Strategic early education?
If nothing will change in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence in vain...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of the company vis à vis consumers from the marketing revolution: it is to join the staff "values" determines the best, as it was made at the consumer products from the technicians in the station to impose.
By customers in the heart of the company has the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in the ground... Although separated the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again!
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, in particular the employees affected.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R & eund, even more importantly, to those of the economic intelligence.
In fact, calls on the IE (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking Sichtweise";sie claims by the staff of a deployment, which the instructions of the authoritarian management completely contradictory.
That is why we are calling for an occupational revolution, which would be the staff at the heart of the concerns of the company equal to the customers.
The very conditional use of internal polls
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange has submitted his wage workers, this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I fear that, unfortunately not.
- firstly, because I could see that the entire structure with a new situation after many Roundabout is concerned, priority... to do what it has always done.
Also because of the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a much simplified idea of human behaviour.
emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of the psychology mechanistic.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently by the U.S. American "neuroscience" reactivated and unknowingly far-reaching research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and it suggests that it is possible to work the "leverage" (sic) on the involvement of employees, reinforced a aktuellein Le appeared Figaro.fr poll by Ipsos executives in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world.
The mobilisation factors identify and measure
Instead, a for the smooth functioning of the modern companies necessary occupational revolution the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is, in any consideration or practice of management to integrate a fundamental record: for the wage-earners is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it clearly appears as a means to achieve a portion of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Now take only the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this concept of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that they allowed their companies on the basis of a specified Doxa judge them by their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these factors can mobilise the executives of the companies' social services ", to predict and anticipate and invest its human resource management back to the right place.
So they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence is favourable.
The speech of Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right a
The American rights on Friday the of Barack Obama on the eve of Oslo speech welcomes and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States has defended.
The Conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, applauded the speech by the president, the example of the former vice-presidential candidate in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in ihrensoeben published memoirs have raised.
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, in Oslo on Thursday sought to justify the use of violence; a way to explain his Entscheidungvon nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent in Oslo "very good work".
I found that the speech was really very good frohlockte the former president of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama's recognised.
In some parts of habeich this speech altogether ginrich perceived as historic, said in the radio programme "the takeaway" has been questioned.
The previous Members by some as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said that he was pleased to see a "President of the left" to the members of the Nobel Committee reminding that they "were not free and a price for peace could not pass unless the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, a former scribe of George W. Bush and now editor in the Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech".
In addition, that he himself as "bucks ", as he always does," he said, "as an American President," as he pointed out that the Europeans, "as in a security bubble, which they have not created themselves and for their protection they do not," Gerson.
Among the few, not convinced rights called the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk in the Bush era, the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, pompous and inspirationslos."
To the left of the President is the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama defended the recourse to the armed forces.
Packaged the war under the guise of the judiciary, to justify the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains praise on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, described the speech itself for a speaker as him, who is known for his talent, as "monumental ".
The speech in Oslo "offers a plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper.
The New York Times is of the opinion that Obama was "the necessary discourse" and described his speech as "bleak and exemplary at the same time".
Drivers: three marathons for an agreement that secures the supply of Christmas
After three weeks of negotiating marathon came the unions of road Association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation, which remained until the end - on Friday evening to an agreement, the strike order and the threat of severe supply bottleneck at Christmas to an end.
At the signature sitting on Friday evening "welcomed" the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of divided the negotiating on early Friday morning in the hope that the agreement at the end of the morning to sign quickly.
And despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) leave the meeting.
However, it has taken more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11: 00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and only about 18: 00 p.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict "should the company very much harm" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rising from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"It is not very much, but we are starting once small", as Mr Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed not to block supply centers.
"There will probably always be some recalcitrant, are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The TLF-Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to give these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wages.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," maxim Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) of a "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke on this matter, "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for the increase of travel expenses by 3% and the objectives of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will enable it, in particular, the issue of 13 monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the sinking of the charges for employers to the tune of EUR 100 million," the subject of an amendment to the government on the draft of the amended finances for 2009, which was on the night of Thursday to Friday, was adopted by the National Assembly.
The government calls "an identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the first on this organisation affiliated companies, and then in the event of an extension through the labour minister for the entire profession.
This will be the case "in a very short period of time," Bussereau insured.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the process.
The Association of FNTR lambasted a "fraudulent trade ", because the 100 million euro" were the sector to offset some of the carbon tax has already been promised ".
The Secretary of State for transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but to avoid disgruntling the goose eaters to the approaching Christmas days, laments the Unostra.
For the association Otre threatens the agreement "small and medium-sized companies in the sector over the next 12 months, a great digging."
Line RER A: disruption this weekend, trade unions, with the proposals of the RATP dissatisfied
The disruption on the line RER a, the largest high-speed network in France for the Paris region and the île de France, at the weekend, during a meeting on Friday, the 2th day of the strike between the unions and the management of en commun (Independent Paris passenger transport administration), the Streikenden with their demands for wage increments further.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas drove between 10: 00 and 20: 00.00 p.m. no trains. On the central route (between La Défense and nation) was just one of two trains and outside the central route is only one of four trains.
The following the guidelines of the SNCF was suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the Reisenden to change.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, the 200000 customers every day counts, welcomed the fact that "the RATP trying to integrate the big business traffic technically."
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from West to East.

On Friday topsy-turvy around one of two trains on the main transport time scheduled, and almost none during the transport time.
As already on Thursday there was no menschengewühl on the bahnsteigen, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had stopped on the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less überlaufen than usual, especially because of the lack of high school.
In - Boissy Saint Léger (Val de Marne), said Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), he would be extra "one and a half hours earlier, stood up in order to get to work on time."
The SNCF, the care of travellers by officials and security forces had planned, pointed out that in the Saint Lazare station to no bottlenecks.
The SNCF on the RER line A or towards Cergy-Le-skin-powered trains came and went on the Saint-Lazare train station, in order to guarantee the end of the Metros.
On Saturday and Sunday again general meetings of the strikers, while the results were reviewed, the associations after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon classified as "pathetic".
The RER-business leaders proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line on all relevant aspects, working hours, professional careers, etc.
But that is not what the drivers want.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP even their pay award proposals in brackets, and stressed that the leadership "does not know how to resolve a problem during the long-distance lorry drivers and the SNCF but also was possible."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting to "comprehensive examination of the conditions" was scheduled for Monday.
This shows the associations, too, that the company "ignores the Wochenendfahrer."

The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday was the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party in the country known; a decision that immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.

The decision followed a in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish federal court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya proceedings. he accused the DTP, which "command" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase the PKK rebels.
The party is assured, "no link" to the PKK, but refuses to describe this as a terrorist organisation, and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court funkt the government intervened, anxious to accommodate the Kurdish community and a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds to support the PKK, the Kurds are drying up and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a dissolution of a outbreak of tensions in the southeast Anatolia could lead, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in recent weeks led to clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the Court gathered thousands of demonstrators outside the premises of the DTP in the millions of city of Diyarbakir in the south-east, mostly populated by Kurds.

"Turkey can clarify these (Kurdish, Mr editorial) issue not on the basis of the ban of a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that has emerged from the Islamist movement, regretted the decision.
"We oppose in principle against the closure of the parties.
That does not solve the problems, "Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a frustrating the democratic opening, which was promoted by the government," the political market observers Ahmet island.
"you can obviously for a reaction from the PKK," he added.
On Thursday, the PKK to an attack, in which three days earlier killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey. It was one of the most brutal attacks over the past few months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was a secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one in ten districts of the capital, Moscow, was in the Soviet Union, a strict bewachter location for secret defence research.
Today, the community with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 miles from the Moscow Centre away, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Major research and production facilities for micro and nano electronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives Selenograds contacts to Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the firms of Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been several mutual visits and signed on Wednesday now Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt a "protocol on closer cooperation."
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed up for Frankfurt Planungsdezernent Edwin Black.
2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises in the scientific Foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after Selenograd.
Scientific exchanges
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ will be on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, want to Russian science firms contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute for electron technology, the big corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The town hall was in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for the defence research has been established.
Selenograd (literally translated as "green city") got its name from the forested hills landscape, in which the research institutes are embedded.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project is purely and simply, "the new heart of Europe".
Law. S21 is much more than the Tiefer of a railway station, more than a gigantic construction project, which is the City of Baden-Württemberg provincial capital for a decade in shambles construction sites chaos.
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980's.
Head stations with tracks that end up in the middle of the city, were at that time as transport technical fossils of the 19th century, as disengage a modern rail transport, as it once was a huge amount of time needed, locomotives from behind umzuspannen forward.
Harvest, keep briefly to go further - so ´ s should go.
And that is why the head stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a durchfahrtsbahnhof the rules half-way through the trans-European schienen-magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the hessischen and the Bavarian city almost unaffordable to implement the Tiefer.
Head stations have also, however, no entry and exit problem anymore, since there are modern turning trains with locomotives and tax cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the new route after Ulm is now being addressed.
Regional and local politicians have enforced.
The train with power, partly because the risks of the largest infrastructure bears-Einzelprojekts the Republic of taxpayers and not the state corporation.
Städtebaulich is the project is still reasonably justified.
There is new stadtraum, is the computergenerierten graphics of the planners - with a lot of green.
For the transport system rail is S21 harmful.
The transit station and the routes expansion are intended for passenger transport, which - typical 1980s - imposed huge growth.
At that time, there was not the competition from low-cost carriers.
Modern transport policy, but it must first go to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads.
But the new route because of intense climbs, not for freight trains.
Much more serious that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
Good six billion euros in schwäbischen are buried.
That is the official number.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion for realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade will be the money to other hubs and Engstellen in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry.
One of the most important is the development of the 180 km route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, is being built on the route in slow motion.
So desperately needed, right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The Rheintal route is the real bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government is considering verdict on the Airport
The regional government has in the Wiesbadener country days left open whether it against the judgment of the hessischen Administrative Court (VGH) on night flights will go in review.
The CDU / FDP coalition have asked experts to the more than 400 pages VGH judgment legally to verify, said Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had founded on these days in writing, that the country in the event of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt airport re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The Authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as required by the government, is not provided with the legal protection of the population against noise at night.
The coalition until 4 January must decide whether it against the judgment in review.
The opposition criticized the suspension and drive to the representatives of the government, in a review in the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD group leader Torsten Schäfer Gümbel called for the CDU and the FDP to come back to their before the election promises to return a night ban; otherwise, this is a "breach".
It is hellishly difficult, if We must keep his word, Greens chief Tareq Al Wazir in reference to the FDP election slogan "We hold word ".
Ministers Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel back, the country government try to come with "Rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand" to their night flights.
A precise legal examination need their time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally Entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
So, as the opposition, are the statements of his group have never been on night flights.
US banks pay back aid
The troubled US behemoths strip their government shackles.
The Bank of America has paid on Wednesday, the aid from the Bankenrettungsfonds Tarp amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars (well 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.
And also the Citigroup plans after a report by the US channel CNBC, to reimburse the state aid.

The money house, at the height of the financial crisis with the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch verhoben.
The Citigroup wants to liberate themselves from their liabilities towards the state also money in capital markets.
On Thursday, the US bank could announce a some 20 billion dollars in increasing its capital, CNBC reported, citing circles.

Rapid election
It was then but everything faster than thought.
Barely two weeks after the zdf-verwaltungsrat the editor-in-chief Nicholas Brender had pushed out the broadcaster can present a successor.
Yesterday evening, the panel wanted to vote on the Personalie.
As the favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studios in Berlin.
There was no confirmation from the station, however - officially, in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, also have played a role, the ZDF Intendant Markus Schächter should not further damage this proposal to the board of directors do not get through.
Frey, Schächters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 council members.
The outcome of the vote was in print this edition is not yet.
Two weeks ago was Schächter with his proposal, the contract with Nicholas Brender to extend for a further five years, on the board failed.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against it. Brenders dismissal was a significant defeat for Schächter, a erwartbare, however.
Because the Union majority on the board had already signaled weeks before the election, not to want to confirm Brender in office.
Had organised the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the hessische Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender had the news of the ZDF lost in ratings, has refused to accept a further term of the highly-regarded chefredakteurs.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
Least had even 35 Staatsrechtler interfered in the debate, the chefs as unconstitutional agreeable.
Nothing came of it.
The person
Peter Frey are scoring was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and Romanistik.
After that, he worked in the Southwest radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey are scoring changed on ZDF, firstly on the "today-Journal."
Subsequent ports: 1988 to 1990 personal advisor of the chief journalist; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; by 1998 head and moderator of "morning magazine "; by 2001, head of ZDF foreign policy; since then, head of ZDF capital studios.
The Greens announced after the dismissal Brenders who was elected on Wednesday by the industries leaf medium magazine for journalists of the year, a constitutional complaint.
Koch's adversary in the Governing Council, the rheinland pfälzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week, the countries should the ZDF international treaty change so that staff proposals of the Intendanten cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
An extract of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of ZDF finished but also from Beck.
Voraussichtlicher Brenders successor Peter Frey had recommended to the board of directors with a bold move - by the body immediately after the Brender-dismissal criticised for that.
Thanks to this Belegs journalistic independence could elect him both Schächter without loss of face for the post of chief journalist nominate and elect the board, without into the suspicion, a partisan office.
In the party arithmetic Frey is already categorised in the left-wing liberals.
Studies will entrümpelt
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strikes drew the Culture Ministers of the countries on Thursday a: a meeting of Kultusminister- and university chancellors conference, both sides agreed that the studies and improve conditions in Bachelor and master.
The students should be able to handle their studies.
In individual they agreed to reduce the examination burdens: in principle should each studies module only with a single scrutiny.
In addition to the workload of the students reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable level".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of audit services between the universities inside and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to common structural targets for Bachelor and Masters more flexible.
Different countries regulations should not be beyond.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Culture Ministers and Uni rector the toe of the better Studierbarkeit in the mouth.
Now it was first filled with a specific content.
The so-called accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of audits, in part: "Each module includes, with only one test, it says in a 30 -page document, which is intended to regulate the authorisation of degree courses in part.
With the "significant reduction of the audit burden," said the Akkreditierungsrat chairman Reinhold Grimm, a "trend should be stopped, the Studierbarkeit significantly disrupted."
Moreover, the "Studierbarkeit" future "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules as content are "strictly to examine" whether "unnecessary restriction of students in the choice of
Events " would be avoided.
The students' right to maintain margins, the own initiative and promote ".
The rules should apply to the approval of new, but also in the review of existing courses.
This must all five years' reakkreditiert "– which means that it will take until 2015, until all courses were reviewed.
The authority responsible for this are federal far ten accreditation agencies, which set up by the countries Akkreditierungsrat.
The Culture Minister had urged the countries in October "with vigour" to the agencies that the material wealth is not too big and not the testing regime is too strict.
In individual Länder universities and technical colleges with the country ministries have already agreed to take appropriate measures.
As currently the only country said in Rhineland-Palatinate for the further development of the Bologna process additional funds.
The money to the universities, above all Tutorenprogramme set up and strengthen studies advice and audit and Auslandsämter.
Country and universities want to spend for ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce an amendment of the higher education law to parliament.
After this is to be the conclusion of a study model only one more test.
The studies should be more flexible, the recognition of certificates to other universities and access to the master easier.
By the end of next year all the courses of the country on their Studierbarkeit be reviewed.
The government and opposition had argued on Thursday again on the studies conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The bundesvorstand the juso-hochschulgruppen called for the organisation of education policy should in future no longer be "behind closed doors' the Minister and university chancellors.
After the latest educational strikes should now also the students "have a say."
Support the future graduates from the President of the university rectors conference (HRK), Margaret winter coat: "we need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with which the HRK debated on a common reform paper.
The trade union education and science (GEW) the Bonn agreement as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal right to each graduates with a Bachelor close access to a secondary Masters course.
On the other hand, must ensure the countries that the current generation of students Bachelor tomorrow sufficiently Masters with the best possible conditions studies available, so GEW board member Andreas cellar.
The countries must be much more teachers.
To a freer access to the master, were the Culture Minister, however.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
In Germany and is nice almost no control... "is the first line of a poem that includes the Lyrikers Werner Söllner, in which addressed in these troubling Sprachfetzen experience the arrival of dissidents, who won the freedom, but has lost both his language area.
The 1951 born in Romanian Banat Werner Söllner had first as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as teachers worked in a children's book publishers before it moves in 1982 after Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has been with various Literature Prizes, in 1993, he stopped the legendary Frankfurt Poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University, and since 2002, he is head of the Hessischen literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For considerable außerliterarisches stir last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, the "German literature in Romania in the mirror and Zerrspiegel their Securitate files."
Visibly shaken and move Söllner read out a statement in which he rumäniendeutschen writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as internal for the Romanian Securitate.
Together with some of those present Söllner 1989 had received the German language price.
The recruitment attempts have begun creeping, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "anyone who is against intimidation of the Securitate not enough."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is in Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize homage to Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of the Romanian-born German authors will be shaken by a case that makes the throes and the cowardice of a recognizable political system, which is based on monitoring and domestic spying.
Werner Söllner is, so far after bisherigem knowledge can say, not only the perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate acts have played a role in Walter, said after the confession Söllners literature scientist Michael Markel for him and pointed to the positive influence of the Walter.
He had swindled him in all for him at the time sensitive points "," Markel.
It is a moral need to make this comment.
Söllners statement was in the form and before this audience unexpected, surprise is the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however.
Germany has been a cosy reserve for Securitate-spy, Herta Müller had already written in July in the period after she had their own acts, 914 pages, read.
The affected, must be suspect, speculation and in some case have known what Klarname behind the Aliases Sorin, Voicu and even Walter Second-term.
Unlike the here now very verfahrenssicheren sighting the Stasi files is dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring still very vague.
A systematic education in recent years and has been obstructed.
An appropriate the Birthler agency National Council for processing the Securitate-files (CNSAS) was founded in 1999, the publication of the files since then has been rather slow.
Only since 2005, there is a law that regulates the management of the files.
That is the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, came after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview, in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar dismissive about the Prize winner.
They have a psychosis, after all, it only once interrogated.
The scandal of the power said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly attached to the case Söllner, as so often in connection with silent guilt, inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the Zuhörenden on Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge urge-whether rather than will be determined by apportioning blame and shame.
The Genese of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League
It felt as if there were just a smart gekleideter Außendienstler by a very nice Christmas party, at a sporting goods manufacturers had distributed Goodies, as the new VfB-coach Christian Gross rose in the company of an orange plastic bag of Ausrüsters a quarter of an hour after midnight in a leaflet called C-class. ¨
The man with the marked Glatze was because of the still foreign city Chauffieren.
Otherwise he would have been able to drive themselves, alcohol was not in the game, and besoffen before luck was the 55-Jährig any more.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow is the work on.
Or will not get moving.
In the words of the first three days before Schweizers pledged: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3: 1-success against Unirea Urziceni in Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: It is a brutally tough fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" on Sunday.
Then, we must in Mainz to repeat the royal class performance in the League of everyday life.
And once again revealed weaknesses in the rapid three gates by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lots to appoint
The final 8 of the Champions League (hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / rückspiele 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) on 18 December in nyon are chosen by lots as scrutineers.
The joy at the start of the fulminanten Babbel-successor remained cautiously so.
Not only the supposed saviours of the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, dedication and spielfreude gives.
I am with the players and told them that they should go back to their strengths, and they have encouraged to be more daring, souls plumber Gross said that as simple-sounding recipe for success, which Therapeut Babbel but no longer had any impact.
He has a certain magic, Babbel supporters Jens Lehmann, "if a new impetus, sometimes things happen in football, which would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, in the after weeks of violation break thanks to his dynamism straight to the best players on the desk, the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh air" and the operation of the new superiors to: "He is a man who and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had it obviously lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns sport Horst Heldt Board
The VfB Stuttgart needs but, above all, constancy.
How big is not as players and managers, the victory against a weakened and substitute completely swamped defense of the Romanian guests exaggerate.
They have also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0: 4 was the evil awakening, was Khedira.
And sportvorstand Horst Heldt reminded that a saisonziel been achieved, the other is still far off.
We are not yet on the mountain.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory since three months after celebrating was not expected, was on the events of the weekend in the form of a direct broadcast television interviews before games start by gate-keepers Jens Lehmann fresh revived.
There are decisions that other and not the Jens, Heldt Lehmanns countered the harsh criticism.
The had been accused of the board leadership weakness and have decided to change coaches to pressure pubertierender fans.
Also that his free day after play had been deleted, girls Lehmann as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmanns statements were "characterised by pure selfishness," keilte Heldt back and announced consequences for the final man.
They will no longer friends for life, the two forty.
After all, but they were with all other agree that, without the preparatory work by the abgelöste trainerteam the games and combative strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large proportion of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann all - and also the man with the Plastiktüte agreed.
World Cup Fight in heavyweight
Hitziges duel in Bern: repeatedly provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitaly Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds of Ukrainians defended his Schwergewichts title after version of the WBC.
The judgment of the judges was unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains box-world champion in the heavyweight.
The 38-year champion after version of the Association of WBC defeated in the night of Saturday in Bern the American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120: 108, 119, 120, 108, 109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defence after his comeback in October 2008.
Before the Ukrainians was twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it has with the k.o., all expected to have not worked.
Klitschko built his record at 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to be beaten on the basis of breaches.
Challenger Johnson in the 24th had to fight the first defeat.
About 17,000 spectators in the Berne arena wanted to dictate the 2.02 metres wide Klitschko the fight, above all, with his left hand.
The eleven centimetres smaller Johnson, the duel before the end of the Klitschko era, but again and again the blows of the world's mayor, so that Klitschko his dangerous rights not crucial to the goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson too little for a challenger and tried only on the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, its blows met the world champion but only rarely.
He is, after all, only the second Boxer after Timo hoffe# countryman in the year 2000, which with Klitschko on the full distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had before the fight in the Swiss capital for some turmoil.
He offended Klitschko as "ugly zombie", the "nothing right".
The cradles was the champion then on Friday to provoke, Johnson the sun glasses of the nose, schubsen "in order to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschkos comeback

After almost four years time out, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and "his" recovered WBC belt, which he had previously made without.
In this year he defeated in his Titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September, Chris Arreola from the United States.
I have received in this fight only a stroke, and am physically very well in form, Klitschko had justified the rapid return to the ring.
His dream remains, but the unification of all four major title in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
The belt of the WBA but the Briton David Haye - after this in November the 2.13 meter Nikolai Walujew.
Haye had earlier in the summer of a planned for September fight against Vitaly Klitschko cancelled.
Supposedly planning of Promotiongesellschaft now the fight against Klitschko in London Wembleystadion.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green group chief Jürgen Trittin called Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information to Kunduz affair as a liar.
The Social Democrats and Left demand information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - following the recent findings on the air of Kunduz the opposition defence Karl-theodor Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two fuel trucks trains in September " knowingly the falsehood, " said Green party chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD-news programme " Tagesschau '.
It is called the landläufig: he lied.
The order to kill, was in disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report, the NATO had read Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday it was revealed that the attack not just a destruction of the abducted vices, but also about two Talibanführer targeted to kill.
In the German Kunduz-commander Colonel Klein requested US air strikes were under NATO inquiry report up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
Green, the Social Democrats and Left on Saturday called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), immediately before the Bundestag to speak and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and whether chancellor, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greens Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor did not on specific operations of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday were also doubts about the portrayal of the ministry on the background to the dismissal of Generalinspekteur Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert loud.
According to the Mirror, the two Guttenberg properly and fully informed about the background of the tank trucks-attack.
Officially, it was said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and denied the minister sensitive details.
In the context of the two top officials said, however, that the Ministry of Defence they would have even pointed to several reports, including a two-way document of the command-off Colonel Klein and a field hunters report.
Wichert is now in a letter asking for clarification of the facts, the 'Frankfurter general Sunday newspaper'.
He had not yet received a Reply, it says.
The ministry said on Saturday not to the accusations and pointed out that will be in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which formed next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some people see in wachem state images and hear voices, others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and drug binge blurs the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in their sleep, everything is in order.
If we are with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we must likes the wildest ideas and Phantasiegebilden.
Anyone who witnessed in a guard traumartige conditions, things can see and hear, see the others do not or hear applies in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drug addicts, at least as a Sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in mental health or drug binge.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between dream, cow and reality.
Traumartig modified Wachbewusstseinszustände can occur in different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Even if the trigger and effect may distinguish the visions of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of New-Age-prophet Carlos Castaneda, schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychosis and hallucinations but similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain - Dopamin, noradrenaline, serotonin and Acetylcholin - and the interaction of various parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no power over him
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of the dream in the eye condition, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, 1861 noted a "great similarity of mistaken one with a dream conditions" for Sigmund Freud was the dream even "a climate, with all the inconsistency, Wahnbildungen, meaning deceit of such".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. in a comic figure.
His body is two dimensions and quietschbunt.
The gravity has no power more about him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him runs devil figures with blutroten, distorted Fratzen, zähnefletschend.
They chase him, him with serious, inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain in the whole body.
Noisy, malicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear the votes to attack and insult him.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet to a noose and consolidating them in a hole in the ceiling.
It is rising on a loudspeaker and establishes the noose around the neck.
Jumping one.
The noose resolves itself.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem choir, "Walk in the clinic and let you cure!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years ago, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoid psychosis, moreover, he is bi-low, he takes medicines against depression, mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, for three years, he is married.
In the climate of I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population contracted at least once a life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common illness after the depression.
In an acute psychosis schizophrenic affected mostly can no longer distinguish between the internal and external world, they get trapped in a übererregten state of hallucinations, scale, relationships or paranoia can lead.
It is particularly prevalent stimmenhören - voices orders, comment on or dialogisieren.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned is important to distinguish between what is trivial, the brain can no longer ausfiltern disturbing signals, the awareness is being inundated with impressions.
As the dream also opens the psychosis the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes.
The reality of perception in the climate is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas fox, Oberarzt the clinic for General Psychiatry in the Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is in the heart of the storm, everything has its importance to him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, as happens in the dream, of the events overwhelmed and can you not actively shape.
Schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A Realitätsabgleich is usually not possible, the Mere empty are cruel reality, wake up.
Once in a lifetime to have experienced a Halluzination
Unlike in the dream, says fox, "but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, basically."
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations based in reality, the Verfremdung of the Erlebens will take place in real terms.
Why exactly our brains antics proposes, researchers are still a mystery.
Exceptional situations in every person can lead that he loses touch with the short-term, says fox.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that affected minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronale maturing of the brain at an early stage of development, will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explained Fox.
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, the manifestiere not also first over many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis, if the overdraft is there.
Also halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychosis, since they intervene in the transmitter system.
If our brain is hot
The nutcases, Psychotiker suffer their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs in order to get rid of them, others give money for drugs in order to get out, which, says the Lübecker psychology professor Erich castes.
Whether related images as pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of the position.
Caste collects for ten years, reports of hallucinations and wore phenomena, last year, he has evaluated its results in the book "The unreal world in our heads".
Hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also of astonishing many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as Borderline or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer's disease and Schädelhirntraumata.
Surprisingly, hallucinates under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so caste, from memory content, which would normally be withheld.
They arise if brain stretches, in which sensory processed, actively discouraged or too little; if our brain is hot, or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also appeal of deprivation, stress, love grief or other mental emergency situations.
In recent studies, up to a third of those polled said that at least once in their lives to have experienced a hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and visited the school there.
A normal girl, really.
If it not for the images and voices.
In the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair it addresses.
If he says the classmates look surprisingly - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They think the timid girl for a stop Tagträumerin, but Sarah K. not dreaming, it knows it.
It is, they see or hear these boys, just as the girls in the bank alongside to see or hear.
You can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that they may be the boys.
Am I crazy?, asks them sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other was wearing images are not real, and then disappear again.
At night, the phenomena mostly frightening
Often the trick images are also a burden.
If you are sitting in the class room, they can follow the teaching material sometimes not because the teachers in their eyes and ears just presents a new classmates, while he explained for all other visually and visible on the table mathematical equations.
At night, the phenomena are mostly frightening.
If they wait in their dark room on sleep, which is far too little and far too late, they can often not distinguish whether she is awake or dreams, whether the pictures she sees that Fratzen or the girl arise with the bleeding wounds on average, arms and legs, above its open or closed eyes.
Let me in peace, they are the characters.
Parents and friends told them nothing, which would be crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She has in the past year the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since the Internet contact with the psychologists caste, it knows full well that they are not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or under reizentzug he has, in all probability, after a while hallucinations, says castes.
I suspect that the brain is then unterbeschäftigt and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a Einzelkind, had as a little girl fear of other children, they often played alone.
Their hallucinations began with 13 learned that the man known as Papa, since they can think of is not their leiblicher father.
As visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and noise, it is affected as Sarah k. difficult to distinguish related images and reality-China. "every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, that is why they are so real. "
Also night dream images of digesting caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation, their fantasy images as unreal.
Caste advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability wertzuschätzen.
Border state between dream and hallucinations
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten world imaginary experience, unfortunately, most pathologisiert, says Michael Schmidt Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a heavy, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative - obsession is also a work of art out of desperation.
Schmidt rapier hardware has researched the so-called oneiroide experience form, a particular form of traumartig modified guard awareness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which holds the Erlebende for real and he also retrospectively cannot distinguish from wakefulness.
The oneiroide bewusstseinszustand arises in trauma- or illness extreme situations, for example in polyradikulitis-patienten in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a man of self- and world loss is threatened by continued, total impotence, it replaces the life-threatening reality through a separate, imaginary world, which is decoupled from the reality, says Schmidt-rapier going hard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucinations.
Since the deal with a situation in reality is not possible, a world of letters, but the real situation in the Imagination.
An intensive form of good Foundation and meaning in an intolerable situation that allows us people own ability, not in a nothing of the Bewusstseinsverlustes.
Everything is real, later in the memory
Also the Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid-experiences in his book "heart change" as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart valves operation, followed by a heart transplant for days on travel, while his body at the intensive care unit for Bewegungslosigkeit.
Claussen, a world in a selbstgeschaffene visited foreign times and places: he is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a zugsanatoriums, a robot guard on his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles manufacturing drugs from blood.
By a Greeks on the motorcycle in his home country, surfing with his hospital bed in Firnschnee the Alps and hits a Korean Mafioso.
He is completely in the imagined events, everything is real, later in the memory.
These internal travel for Claussen differ fundamentally from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travel even after years and in secondary details abundantly clear.
More and more even than really Erlebtes.
The intensity of this Erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other secular life experience, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degen hard.
Ultimately, show Oneiroide psychoses, hallucinations and drugs binge, how fragile our internal figures of external reality in the guards.
Any change in the Bewusstseinszustandes, say the psychologist caste, "can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality."
An experience which may also be enriching.
The snow fall can come
Burda
Children should take the publishing house with 27 years
The new publishing chief Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run will be Hubert Burda companies in the hands of his two children, he said the SPIEGEL.
The holding is also in future to 100 per cent of the family.
Hamburg - the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit with 27 years and have the firm will to enter the companies, said the 69 Jährige the SPIEGEL.
The details we have regulated as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are active in the company, only then.
The question of whether they are able to do so.
We cannot 7 500 staff his children Swallow, if they are not sufficiently capable.
This brings the children and the company .
Burda had announced on Thursday that he withdraws from January by the chief executive, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen on his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen is a board member since 1999 in Burda.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later came with the Treasury's responsibility for the corporate wealth and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finances.
For the first time, is not a family member at the head of the verlages.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serve to "10 to 15 years to bridge," Burda.
The holding should continue to 100 per cent of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the cases and Schickedanz Schaeffler Burda said that family businesses are not above the sinking are safe: "It was always families who were infected by a capital addiction, which is completely verspekuliert and thought they could rise as the great player.
My strategy was the never.
He had "never had world power dreams," Burda.
I am not as the political Präzeptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to be a player in the world league with "Time ', these shops have become too great.
The promises of FonPeek
Äusserst Peek is limited, a device with which one can only read his e-mails without a chance to be able to see some annexes or surfing the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, as the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
It is on the Straβe to see is unlikely, but the idea in itself, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the Peek Smartphones cost very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company's success has seen it has two new devices on the market: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a life-long free service for data, in contrast to the Peek, in which we must pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits, as his American counterpart, however, has come as a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone around the world, already know what it means to have to dispense with all the data, in order to be able to read his e-mails, once you cross the border or if you are desperately seeking a café with WIFI (or a link possibility with Fon).
The idea of the roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that offer some telephone providers already offer specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses, in order to be able to read all the fine print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always ignored.
Auβerhalb of their own country has always been afraid to read his e-mails, and rightly so.
That a small device such as FonPeek (and it is always amazing that it has the name of Fon, although it has no Wifi / WLAN) this type of tariffs can offer, means that the telephone providers slowly, but surely rethink and start to of options to consider how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example in its prices is the downloads of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
It is an internetfähiges equipment and pay only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month.
And that is what I expect of FonPeek one day, a buying opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it offers the Peek already in the United States.
And this is not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this, because I am of the opinion that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish colour of Michelle
Yellow is without doubt the favourite colour of the American First Lady.
Even with the arrival of Barack Obama as President of the United States, they appeared in a dress and a coat of paint and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: to accompany the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has taken on both occasions very similar models, except that it was almost the same colour - a leading grüngelb - was the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and the same substance, and it was something großförmig gesticktes or a neck chain.
It even goes so far as that the first sight seemed that the First Lady of the United States on the model of the Princess of Asturias and decided to follow the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes but very much in the Stoffart, from which they are made.
At the inauguration, she wore a dress from head and one in Oslo from gemusterten velvet.
Also the accessories were different: the first time green shoes with halbhohen paragraphs and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
Also, the hair every time was different: the hair were high on this occasion as a hair wreath, with the previous they helped open the hair.
75% of working mothers have because of their maternity problems in the work
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who wish to have children.
This result is the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women study "fertility and career women in Spain."
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career are in the labour market because of their motherhood.
The study is laying that there is very broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work they perform.
Those of you who auβerhalb of the House do no other work only part-time work or a fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast to postpone the women with a solid job, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"the women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a solid job get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the drawing, a figure that has to 4.1 years for women with solid employment increases, which took longer to achieve this and withdrawal-implied and have the first child until much later.
Auβerdem also has the type of work a groβen influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar on the empfängnisbereitschaft ", explains the csic-forscherin Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor in the age of the women in the marriage and the first child must be taken into account.
According to the survey, the age at the time of the marriage and the first child the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also in the women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are only the main education or a higher education, on average, each with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time mother.
There is also still, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss even before its first permanent employment and their first child, making it the women with a medium or high school completion exactly the other way around and find a permanent employment and marry later and then have their first child, Delgado.

Here are a few sequences from the book.

On Samuel Beckett: "nihilist, allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what it is in the blood, not in his mind, had, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a umwerfenden poetic humour, without any sense of how the messerklinge that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, so in its ranks, in whose meat the emotions on grounds of adultery with the pleasure of remorse united, a spiritual privilege, which was to arrive in the sky in the face of corruption."
On James Joyce: " Ulysses " was in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000er summit of world literature, one must climb on the north wall, on the wall, which repeatedly try the best mountaineers. "

What intended because Benet, if he is not in the arms of Faulkner?

Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking last week by our part of the city in the municipality of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years, in addition to her and our dog herliefen, our dog is a Mischling, which we have taken from the animal and just six kilos, and then out of the blue lost him two Fußtritte and injured him so hard.
Our indignation, one can never be in words, since it is incomprehensible to us, where since the spass in a cheap aggression against a small and hilfloses animal, which is, of course, be on the leash.
In addition to the tragic attack, a woman who was comfortable walking, she wanted to see these people as a result of an incident chastise them even feared for their own lives, because if a profound mania that attacked a dog, he will be the same, perhaps also with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhoods at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has geheult all day long.
We have, of course, in a nahgelegen police department reported, however, we have great doubts about whether anything will bring and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we would just make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation about what has happened has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what needs to be in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal fun, of an animal which we love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and the respect for the animals and the people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the Helmgebrauchs especially among the younger motorcyclists as both companies announced today.
This initiative will draw attention to the importance of the helmet use, because it is ultimately the only protection element, the head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident can prevent.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment in relation to road safety, the "far more than just the design and manufacture of products with each day safer 'and, on that you also with other actions educational and informative nature will contribute to this objective every day to come a step closer to.
This new campaign to promote the helmet use on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'to be or not to be' runs, in a first phase posters of over 500 motorcycle workshops, in order to achieve the bestmöglichste spread.
In conclusion, Michelin, stressed that the road safety "is a constant concern" of the company, and it is precisely for the reason that they committed themselves as manufacturers of tyres for two rädige vehicles always see that one of its main objectives of the development of safer products.
The sale of small lorries is rising again something
After nearly two years of the car market for small trucks to a light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain mean an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months will decline, according to the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam presented figures.
These are good numbers, however, to date, only with groβer caution genieβen because the comparison used reference data in November 2008, which was a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must remember that, apart from the rise in the last month, the overall admissions of the 11 months still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, total 95.853 vehicles sold in this number, but all vehicles from which the kleintransportermarkt is that contain: descendants of cars, pick-ups, kleintransporter, small vans and lighter kleinlastwagen / chassis.
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, most in demand, because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals, most of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third-party financing.
So we need to these restrictions, which are the result of the zugedrehten cries of credit institutions, there are other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this scenario, and unlike the cars, have the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000E little help.
However, this plan is not only destined for private individuals, including the self-employed and small businesses have a right to expect that, if they are a vans up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 Ausstoss not exceed 160 grams per mileage may want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday had Ganvam reminded that it is part of the state, including a special attention to this small vices and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealers association predicted for the year 2010 a year, such as the last, for which it with a loss of sales (for passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%.
The support for Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As it was the Antiblockierbremssystem ABS and how it is now happening with the ESP stability control ESP, must auxiliary systems on the brakes in the increase in the European cars.
In fact, they are already duty all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, for the remaining vehicles has set a waiting period until the end of February 2011.
The decision by the European Union Manahme aims to improve the protection of the Fugänger, but these braking systems because of their operation also help to prevent many front-rear collisions.
The task of the Notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical Bremsmanövers, which recognises the system on the basis of the drivers Bremsstärke carried out on the brake pedal to exercise.
However, this system is not this pressure until the end.
According to one of the components manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles commissioned inquiry, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the toss, not more to come on the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The Bremshilfe against resorts with maximum force in the braking system and reduce the Bremszeit and therefore also the Bremsabstand, a car in the Bremsvorgang back.
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians to damage, be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of Notbremsassistenten.
It would even be less accidents - it is calculated that every fourth accident involving personal injury could be avoided - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking are popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver, and at the same time, a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then, helps him the system to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, if it would be necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the toss is unavoidable, the Bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes from, in order to keep the damage as much as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that will launch the production of the new Meriva in the first week of April, probably on 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturers to indicate that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, will ensure that the affected side their assent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which first postpone the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works, to be presented by the beginning of 2010.
Dementgegen assured from GM that it will in the next few days will take a decision on the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car Bauer, so that this is a decision as soon as possible.
GM is to stand with some potential new buyers in contact.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy Volvo, however, wins the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper-sports cars, which the Russian group Converg backing has ever stronger support.
If it should come with any of these buyers to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to schlieβen Saab at the end of the year, if it is not sold, will also continue.
At the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel used the engineers Boxster S as a base and made it really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only 1,275 kilograms.
Order to create something they refrained from first to the automatic aufklappbare roof, which has been replaced by a Zeltleinwanddach with manuellem powered, so that alone has saved 21 kilograms, thanks to the aluminium used in this model, as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; the removal of the air conditioning again in 13; it has also reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, so that were saved another 7 kilograms; saved through the installation of sporting Bacquet seats again in 12 and with the slight 19 customs wheels back five.
Then we had still achieved through the renunciation of the audio system CDR-30 again six kilos less and through the exchange of Türgriffe Griffe from substance by the absence of a kilo.
Although he was also with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, the test ride in a vehicle with 6-normal hand wheels carried out mainly on the smaller Landstraβen of California, on mountain routes, which are really very kurvig.
In his behaviour can give him only the note perfectly.
The reduction of its weight, but has not meant that he is now no longer so sure would be on the road.
Rather, the opposite is the case, for a long time, we have no longer such a small and light model test, which is a but also a sense of groer security in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable, his muscles in a low gear in the necessary time to make warm until we give him the orders, to lawn, too slow to recover and then back again everything from his engine to get out...
He makes everything he says. the car makes everything we him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its management, which is just as communicative and precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine Sound for all tastes
The Sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and you can still raise it with the 'sport' -Option and by means of a system that can change the engine sounds, which already on the Panamera was used for the first time.
The acceleration is unimaginable wealth brutal, whether from the foot out or when re-acceleration.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads, on which we went with the Boxster Spyder, was damaged, but the car meisterte the potholes.
The electronic assistants had to do on the entire route almost nothing at all; and, although we in some of these curves ice at dawn and Rollsplitt this morning.
In summary, we can say that there is an ultra-easy car is a car with an indescribable Fahrspass has, as it otherwise rather rare and it is much more than just a slight improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and cost 70.831 EURO.

The Baskonia pays itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many fancy players in the team against Mr Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complex football field of Maccabi Electra and so in the first place in its group after the great performances of Mirza Teletovic, with eight triple was the best of his team in the assessment (29).
The team from Vitoria, the significant loss of Mr Mann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov replaced by a large dose of use and team work, even if they had to wait until the bitter end to its victory.
The great hits from the Perimeter with 16 countries three times contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blauroten which, from the very beginning at the top of the screen.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already from the Perimeter came out, it was already that it holds on to the pitch with good reheated wrist.
It was English and Teletovic, mainly for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter were responsible.
The second quarter was little different, only that the team from Álava opted for a innenseitiges game of Barac and for the game by Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with Pfiffen and applause, which is home to increase their advantage further before the break (34-43).
Teletovic began, emphasis as the best of his team with 13 points, wennn the "minus six" assessment of cluster already guess that this would not be the best night of Brazilian.
Despite the was the game despite the clear advantage in the recess is not long and the Makkabäer wanted the Vitorianer once again remind you that not everyone on the pitch, and thanks to the "hand of Elías" they came into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed significantly to that the "yellow" the helm Umdrehten (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but far from dead, had to prepare a few gambits with accuracy, in order to regain the air and one of them was suddenly the gun of Mirza Teletovic, with three consecutive almost three times and with the support of English and Ribas that ads on the table again einberuhigender refrain from (54 - 67), the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57 - 67) could make.
The alavesen last quarter bloβgestellt and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they would allow anyone to give them the victory they are in the first dreiβig minutes honestly deserved, being taken away again.
Nonetheless resigned Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team and tried not to their team by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and despite the cluster because Fouls was submitted by the place, not on the team of Ivanovic, defended well and although the Israelis nor at the last minute aufholten (80-85), the game had already been a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.

Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to relinquish the lead in Group B of the Euro League to him, and that in a game that was marked by the failure on the part of players from Unicajas (free country, Lima and Archibald), particularly in the domestic game, what the Greeks facilitated the victory.
The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the most of Europe and a lot of money.
You offered their game in the first quarter had the Andalusians start to dream. an aggresive defense and three consecutive times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the ereins Unicaja, even if the local team with a domestic game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the ads plaque in the 13th minute, 22-20 anzeigte in their favour, the minute in which it almost due to an action for the brawl between the two Americans would Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to warm up and its superiority in both games, receiving, while the departure of the Englishman Joel free country because of a violation and the three self-inflicted mistakes of Carlos Jiménez clear traces the Unicaja hinterlieen.
Among their players in the field and the Lithuanian Vorspieler Linas Kleizas, with its three times, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44 - 32.

Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and the three of Cook and the use of Lewis back some hope to 66-57.

Brazil called Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has the residence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa a deadline.
The office of President must be removed from the diplomatic representation at the latest on 27 January, when seinMandat 2010verlassen officially expires
Francisco Catunda, trade delegates of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed the TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he before that date the message, in which he since 21 September had found asylum, must have left.

Thank you!
According to the most enticing days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets the prevailing mood in the markets was the uncertainty in the markets back again, which is not surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The Maβnahme used to stabilize the markets, it was to pay off the debt with the direct purchase of assets and, indirectly, the liquidity to allow a free hand in interest rates, which move the zero, so that in this way the banks assets to buy Abrechnen.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets as well as ended and, without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question, start to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE näc already vormachte with its annual auction, which takes place next week.
Therefore, investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The Flüchtigkeiten of stock markets and the differences in corporate bonuses rise again, even if they are still a long way from the para-normal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt will rise again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the favorite refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences of the countries in the euro zone in regard to Germany.
Spain has until now barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, does not harm a degree of uncertainty in order to produce the defenders of the moral hazard to silence the again tried with the leaders of the world's economic policy, an awareness, for what they had caused, because they are the devastating effects the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, as they are actually a new day for beschlieβen thanks action should have been.
Nevertheless, this indicates what happened in Dubai, a tribal war between the Emiren out to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously anticipated.
A government which conceals the public debt, elections and a new government, which draws on the same side.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the non-fulfilment of its external payments saves and thus gives a euro member country to meet its commitments.
However, it is logical that Ecofin forced the Greek government has to be transparent and its citizens in need of auβergewöhnlicchen Maβnahmen with the duty to maintain the stability of public money.
Yes, we are as expected from an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some Ausschweifungen to high amounts, it would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, we must not worry, as long as the differences of public debt with the same speed as the European unternehmensboni increase.
Should the European differences and reduce the Spanish dannn would continue to increase, it is a special Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local early indicators of a Groβteil of market research institutes forces to correct their scenarios for the recovery and their scenario for 2011 upwards, the einschlieβlich OCDE and the European Commission, which again with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, promising all this despite warnings not long life.
Once again, it appears that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stock, although at the moment, "caution ".
Associated industries
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, came as the first yesterday before the subcommittee of the House, where the strategy in relation to the energy supply of Spain in the next two decades.
After his appearance, the chairman of the Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca followed Galán the press gave some key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind versschlossenen doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola Spain must 50 billion by 2020 Euround further 60 billion to invest from that date until 2030, under the promotion that the current nuclear power stations will continue to remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, would the investment needed to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that we should not invest more in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020, the question will change and we should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to sterilize the carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energy.
