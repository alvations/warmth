The lack of snow in the mountains the hotel
The tracks were not a problem that operators of ski lifts.
The lack of snow discourages people to book their stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find rooms free for all dates in winter, including Christmas and new year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
The Internet offers, asking prices but do not dare commit to reserve for the time being.
And if they call us, they call immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.info.
To spend the new year of his dreams to špindlerův Mlýn, it is better not too reluctant to reserve.
If the priority is given to economies and that the quality of accommodation is only then, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The Hotel of špindler not propose at the moment that stays of a week for the new year.
I think they will try one more time to place, but they also and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of rooms free will rapidly diminish, "said Jandura.
The tourism agency Ingtours of proposed free beds for all periods of winter.
The Christmas week interests us most at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There are still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some last minute Christmas less expensive, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The tourism agency of May also propose the new year to Krkonoie, but there are fewer empty seats.
The first 14 days of February as well, the remaining winter trips are selling moderately.
This year, the interest in the winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow to Krkonoie.
People expect it to get to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the to cover during the week, Christmas also will be complete, "think Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of about five percent.
We still have a few places for the new year and Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holidays of Polish January and February also sells well, "Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in PEC.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking of Jánské Lázně is also full to Eighty percent during the period of the new year.
On the contrary, half of the beds are empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel Jánské Lázně.
This year, we have been pleasantly surprised by the month of January, when we have already occupying Sixty percent at present.
February is a bit more low at the moment, but as soon as the snow is falling, the interest for stays in Krkonoie certainly still indicated the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The Hotel of Krkonoie should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will more and precipitation, they should be in the mountains.
But the time should warm, Jií Jakubský station of the Czech HydroMeteorological Institute.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the effort with which Barack Obama, the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, it considered itself simple.
When it came to leave its doctrine so hard, it turned out that he had in carbon paper since the Iraqi scenario of Bush from three years ago.
Not content to use in the text several times the expression "as in Iraq, it has not hesitated, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech:" a new way forward "
At the same time, he personally criticized the Bush position to send new reinforcements in Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following month, however, have shown that the Bush strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of the commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely success to the point that the newspapers currently do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not enhanced the reputation of Bush, however, objectively speaking, it was left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than we could have hoped.
Barack Obama hope that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
are the commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase of the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley Mccristal, which has severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
Asked 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favourable.
The president has hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, at least he had defrauded the general 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to root out the promise of additional 5,000 on the part of Europe, even if it were on 10,000.
This brings the most problems in the Obama strategy appears to be its intention to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan within the next 18 months and to complete the whole process within the next three years. The doctrine of Obama raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half the same fruit that progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation is different in the exact opposite - we can not rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to change leader from day to day depending on what suits them.
The political institutions, although officially based, will remain as the wool over the eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity on the reports, which are further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state quick to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy perplexed by his voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and outside the reality can be confident that the small soldiers sent in the turmoil of war for "speedy return home" will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, define a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban as the indirect admission of defeat us.
The last summit of NATO showed that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or do not want to explain to their constituents how the security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that the sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face of the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
Will respond by example at a time when, according to Obama, America will the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this type will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Obama is the fact that it is three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time to working on a new strategy, should it prove to be a total fiasco.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will receive bonuses in cash
The employees senior leaders of the US bank Goldman Sachs will receive no more this year in cash.
The company announced in response to strong criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of money, they can not sell before five years.
The actions can be taken to the leaders in case they would take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs raises leading the effort to link the rewards with the long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suspect that Wall Street is well aware of the overall direction to be taken, "said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of the Corporation
The concern is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after being set aside nearly $17 billion in premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of the premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, large bonuses in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it intended to affect a single tax of 50 per cent bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 books.
France is preparing similar measures.

The minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus has invited to the castle
The president Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the finance minister Eduard Janota, his stay in government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota the cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting Friday.
Klaus also criticised the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further widens the crisis of public finances.
The presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed of the meeting.
Janota then discuss its function Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget which will be submitted to the signing of Klaus is a deficit of $163 billion kroner that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the Chamber of Deputies approved Wednesday the proposals of the left transfers of money and has increased the rewards of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the proposals of the Social Democrats that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, disagreement which calls into question the future of Fischer cabinet which was formed by agreement between the ODS, the čssd and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was voted by the deputies, removes the package of measures by the government of Fischer and must which the debt of the state.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget but that there is no requirement to do so, said today at a breakfast with entrepreneurs discussions, that the policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "disability" of public finances.
Now, in his view, there is no solution.
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, if it could rely on a broader consensus among the political parties, according to the president.
The ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should call into question its future existence.
The vice-president of the ODS Petr Neas said that the idea of a Cabinet supported by the čssd, ODS and the Greens does.
In its response, the prime minister Fischer has called such words of "drastic".
The head of čssd Jií Paroubek has responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit for this year by the former government of Topolánek is appalling and that it will exceed 200 billion kroner.
Wednesday, the čssd described as a success the ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The Popular Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by actors Americans, South Africans say that the new film of Hollywood - will explain to the world a lot about the country, its fighting and victories.
The history of sport, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, U.S. actor rewarded the Oscars, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the apartheid racist regime in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said, that it is a 91 - year-old Mandela who asked him to embody it in the film.
Matt Damon plays an important role.
I told him: "If I were you, I should be able to see you personally.
The 72 - year-old actor who was rewarded a prize for his role in the drama dollar baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of the boxing has, for example, the leader of a movement against slavery itself slave, a fictional US president, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and so important to so many people that is Mandela.
The Ex-homme of South African state has been imprisoned 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
INVICTUS is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak with him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country Resteencore and still divided racially and economically after apartheid.

The South African team will advance in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked for a few years to bring the history of Mandela on a large screen.
I had no other purpose otherwise play this role in order to bring it closer to the reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me it was, of course, talk like him
The actor said that if he and the international political rights were in the same region, it would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake hands with you, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh environment of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a surprise.
I remember when I come to the door of the house, I opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was:' I have the air much greater in the film ".
Despite the differences between the actors and actual models, under the leadership of director Eastwood has received positive opinion and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.

The mystery of will in Norway is committed: the Russians tested a rocket
There has been a strange light phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has recognized that yesterday have tested a rocket intercontinental ballistic not far from the Norwegian border.
However, the launch has been a failure and the missile type "which was originally to be the pride of the Russian military is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its presence in the rocket testing has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, has not, or it is damaged in flight.
The Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as the "missile which do not steal"
A missile that did not fly but
This test took place at the beginning.
It was not until the end of the flight that there was again the damage on the apparatus.
This is clearly the engine of the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" of the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving boat and
This is the reason for the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object apparently was a "defective".
Besides, the Norwegians have not doubted for a moment that this is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we can not talk of failure.
The first two floors of the rocket have resisted and the damage was confined to the third.
In previous cases, the drivers have experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches happened smoothly, the Ministry of Defence considers that only six out of thirteen have been failures.
This success rate of almost 50 percent fills the general optimism and they therefore always claim that one day "Bulava" without problems and that it will prevail even ten nuclear units with a total weight of 1.15 tons.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The direction of the Hyundai plant in Noiovice has agreed with unions to cancel all overtime.
It is because of frequent overtime that unions have declared a state of emergency strike Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk plant Hyundai has confirmed.
The Directorate is yet to reach agreement with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We can not give up our production plan, it is essential, and that is why voluntary overtime have been proposed on Saturday, 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said.
The site Sedmička.cz indicated that the company proposed a bonus CZK 400 employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for hours, or they can ask a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their Christmas and new year Aindiqué.
On top of this all employees present on Saturday will be compensated for the costs of transport and for their lunch.
Given the fact that the additional hours were the most urgent and the warmest in the comments and the demands of the unions and employees who have spontaneously ceased production last week, the immediate management made the decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said.
Until last week, the car factory employees were forced to work almost daily two hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions cancel the strike after signing of the agreement.
The following negotiations between the management and unions to take place Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the strike if agreement on their claims and signing of a common document.
The situation in the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 workers were on strike because of overtime.
They also protested against poor pay and alleged hazing.
Management has defended with the fact that employees had to work supplement to meet the imperatives of auto production.
At the announcement of the strike Monday, the unions also asked that the employees who have ceased production are not subject to any sanction.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a reward of 5 million NOK (about 209 about).
The Hyundai car plant of Noiovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started the series production last year in November.
It has produced about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on the HIV virus ""
A team of Czech and German scientists testing new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it is also on the virus that have already developed an immunity to the drugs.
This is, in some cases, the fact that the combination is not as intensively on common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
However, it can prolong the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
Consumption, however, a series of side effects.
The suppression of this expansion is the development of so-called resistant viruses on which the medicines have no effect.
The work of the three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the Všcht Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called Metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The Metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used to date and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers to discover new substances "improved", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their links on the proteins of the virus.
The Metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two cages to multiple walls are formed by the boron atoms of hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case the Cobalt.
A virus traitor and resistant.
The HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the Division of HIV caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop the HIV protease, also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers explained in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal of medicinal chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic link, which is then systematically amended.
A little smaller but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the HIV protease was tested in test tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of Metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical medicine, however it does not weaken on resistant versions against which current drugs are often ineffective.
The Metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to consider further move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína řezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS is attacking Fischer, who is defending
The chairman of the ODS (Civic Democratic party), Mirek Topolánek has described as "staggering" ratified the budget for the following year and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The prime minister called the ODS of drastic verdict.
He said to take time to analyze.
The ODS spokesman Petr Neas said that the idea of a Cabinet supported by the čssd, ODS and the Green party did more.
According to Neas, the head of the government should decide whether Ilprend in the chamber of deputies support on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if it is to remain in his post with the support of the parliamentary left.
Neas has warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats in relation to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, however, with the proposed amendments to the tune of 12 billion kroner included by the left.
The chamber has increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint against the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they indirectly the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of $163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government as what an amended budget is a variant less bad than a budget.
Disappointment and
The finance minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
Neas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his post in the event of ratification of the proposed changes, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech television, Janota made an appointment Monday with the prime minister after his passage to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he wondered if he would remain in his post.
His disappointment with the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, NEAS believes that the representatives of čssd, which have imposed changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the house ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit, such as those for health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of government Fischer and the government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done anything harmful, said in a press release from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries would claim top 09, which voted against the budget.
Neas said that if Fischer decided to give his resignation in the face of the fight against the amount of the deficit of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority which is currently in the house."
That said, it should not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda when I, said since the House to journalists, the minister of defence Martin, elected to office by the Democrats.
The prime minister Fischer has soared in the afternoon for a discussion of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has backtracked at the request of the prime minister.
Neas noted at the same time that the ODS would probably Wednesday voted against the amended budget if he had not specifically asked the Democrats to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphaned, it is not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been the president of the party in the house or in the countries involved in the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I knew already when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolchévisation of the House and destruction of all that was positive, reacted in person.

This is the fifteenth line of the commuter system, the opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The lines to the capital will be their final destination at the main railway station in Prague (Praha Hlavní Nádraží).
The will introduce more lines SC between Prague and Ostrava and trains to / leave by intervals of two hours.
The passengers will no longer be able to take up to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for the railways regional: 200 million kroner.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and the railways next year by a total of four billion kroner to losses visible, the same amount as this year. The regional trains were ordered by the regions who will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate to the tune of almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have newly signed a contract for 10 years, until now, the length was still a year.
The railways the system, which also explains that they have not resorted to a price increase of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will affect only tickets a day net and Internet tickets at reduced prices Eliika.
For travellers without card, the price of net will increase from 450 to 600.
The price of Eliika will depend on the distance covered, whereas previously it was valid between the towns of a region of choice and was a single tariff of 160 kroner.

The history of South Africa to the world, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film of Clint Eastwood arrives in American rooms in the coming days, the title is (the Czech official title is: Neporažený), and Narrae a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against the apartheid globally known returned to Morgan Freeman, who has been chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody.
The second male role of the legendary champion of rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in rooms, the critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
Its full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 to Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations since it comes at a time when the South Africa is in full preparations for the football World Cup, and because the media are agitated by disturbing news about the increase of racial conflicts and discrimination of people on the part of the black majority to power.
According to the agency, reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations towards the main roles where "of Hollywood stars.

I dreamt of this role for many years and I am well prepared.
I have also repeatedly met personally Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - its energy, he said in the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think that is a good thing if we had the opportunity to remember via the film personality and the message of Mandela.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it is a matter for each individual, he added.
Wear the shirt of the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title Freely translated. In the role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece gave its people the defender of human rights during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman in the film trying to pick up two racial groups of a population long divided and as Nelson Mandela in 1995 it between the national team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won.
To be shown on the lawn in Jersey, which is seen in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been extensively Fourteen years ago mainly white audience and has been recognized by the white population.
Hope that the soccer championship will be able to unite the people again in a single nation, "said the rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only" black "of the national team.
It remains to be seen if the situation tense situation will improve.
The white South Africans are however sceptical as recently in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, rugby fan who has fled to Britain.
The championship begins June 11, 2010.

Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three prefects of čssd
Radim Jančura, owner of student agency, will file today for defamation complaint against three prefects Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal of the region of the South Moravia, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated in Dvacet of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to exploit regional railways in some regions.
However, all regions have eventually sign long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three have attacked us and say that the fine, while it has only made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech railways which have been signed last week.
Therefore it only remains for us to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on society student agency, said Jančura to Radiožurnál.
It reported that it had evidence that no region has conducted in agreement with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Considers that the complaint of Mr Jančura represents the result of its media spectacle which serves as free advertising for his company and for him.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on others to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and using false and misleading arguments about the regional rail transport, said
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement that approaches regions.
He said Radiožurnál it stopped the campaign after Christmas and that it intends to resume after the new year.
He said that the campaign will target corruption in the broadest sense.
Jančura began its campaign after the regions have agreed to give the Czech railways exploitation of railway links to an order of about 150 billion kronor, without issuing a call for tenders.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats of a member of the čssd.
The only threat was that if not stopped, we could lose our bus licences.
He presented himself as a member of čssd, I do not know who they are but I will not say his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcal will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcal old habits early January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time for the families.
Already, there are voices saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already for vaccines the maximum price that will pay for health insurance.
The specialists also see clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcal.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If the vaccination was started last year or earlier, you must pay yourself the following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated children against pneumococcal.
Yet the parents paid 1600 even more for a dose.
The vaccination of more young requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year the health insurance spend 300 to 450 000 SEK in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on medical care that the children not vaccinated.
So far the state was spending approximately 500,000 per year for the vaccination of children.
The vaccination was introduced with the "package Janota".
The pneumococcal are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including the inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to surveys in hospitals, until 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
From the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the vaccination.
The immunization be mandatory?
There are opinion on a possible vaccination in the future.
In January, it must be resolved by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted the vaccination against pneumococcal.
At an international conference in which our association participated, experts were not really satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose this much.
I think that it is a direction that we must now monitor said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not change the process of vaccination against pneumococcal.
We do not see it at the moment, "said his spokesman Srieň.
The optional vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of paediatricians, acknowledged that a vaccine based on the Volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered a decline of vaccinations "in the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making the optional vaccination" said however Cabrnochová.
The experts predict that by next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcal also marks a break from the fact that this is the first vaccination of children, which is financed by the insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explained that insurance should free up funds for prevention, they would save and on possible future medical care.
Physicians will have to buy their products themselves
This is linked to the concerns of practitioners, related to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy the vaccines by insurance, the receiving in the same way as other products of vaccine provided by the state.
Some members were concerned, however, that this would allow insurance to deduct the amounts of health insurance ".
The doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians individually invest nearly 40 000 SEK per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according Cabrnochová.

Can Islam Be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, fans of the author's latest book, "why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), an elegant study and well documented on an issue that has divided and concerned the country for the past 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The last book by Mr. Bowen introduced a much broader and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, he does not want to know what the politicians and the media say on Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that provide now in France this Quem. Bozen called "spaces" for 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well listen and reproduce the discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
A Muslim marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a Non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on interests for a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas of concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia that today, are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secular nature of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved only with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite Guardian if virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, the Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to the Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to compromise with the secular Republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrow key values".
Can Islam Be French? after reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The most gloomy view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice which is melting at an alarming rate, carrying with it a life that can not survive elsewhere.
The oil, gas, shipping and fishing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now the writers in their wake.
In "on a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
History and policies of the whale, it describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were their evidence in the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous 14 years of age who had to fight just the tip of his, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, caught as they swam alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a show celebrates 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the area required an adult in the climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, in America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopter and Inuit Indians in use Fusilsd' powerful assault to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the more northern waters of the two nations of hunting as the ice remains the longest.
In his new book, "after the ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of the Arctic science and a fascinating overview of what the future might be there.
Not that the scientists have all the answers.
Neither the Atmosphéristes nor oceanographers can accurately tell the speed of change.
It is not for lack of trying.
Late nineteenth and early twentieth, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The Cold War submarine were then mapped changes Sous-celle-ci.
The surveillance satellites and probes placed on icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by men, in the cold.
Mr. Anderson the extraordinary world and tiny system dependent on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water by freezing.
But the Bears above the wonders microscopic contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, this may be our turn"
The Marine, among the 6,000 people who laid wreaths on the graves at Arlington
The first class De' Angello Robinson, 19, made a journey of seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and the other Marine who made the trip to Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina at Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to salute the men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, where we are, we will be in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If this happened to me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, that is why I am trying just to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the Arlington Cemetery ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, has launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate several hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, and his wife Karen, every year the journey, stopping in different cities on their way to organize commemorations in honour of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (of Wreaths Across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery Enarkansas, in Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 to, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that it had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career military died.
Although her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed.
It is a small gesture that can civilians do to support our troops, she said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
In several layers of warm clothing, Unv market between the lawns and hills tracts of the cemetery.
The volunteers have chosen ancient tombs, dating from the first and second world war, and the Vietnam war, because they are not as often visited the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, while the children were playing and couples holding hands, wearing the crowns of pine costs on the graves.
Each table had a dark green, with a small knot red butterfly on the top.
Nearby, the silence on the Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 wreaths to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current war zone.
Individuals without hiding, others praying and families and friends supported in the cold air.
Some read out loud the names engraved in stone while others looked to see small information cards black and white, in the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears, on the grave of her son.
It is part of Zanesfield, in Ohio and had led eight hours to come to gather at the tomb of Marine Sergeant Gunnerydavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should never forget we are free ... my son has paid for it, she said.
"Long after I have gone, I want someone to remember him."
An American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested an American citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, said the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The citizen, which has not yet been identified, works for development alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of "dangerous".
All the so-called revolutionary activities, including protests moderate and critical writings, the risk of arrest.
The graffiti and speeches are regarded as serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of more and more, conducted by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who writes often on the husband and she were followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but the authorities have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration which pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by The New York Times, Friday evening.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the US to reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted to Cuba, though it is new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of a civil servant is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for SMS or for a 15 - minute conversation that corresponds to a day's pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
The Cubans wishing to connect often must provide their name to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press attaché to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any open society, would be allowed - - free distribution of mobile phones - - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas program director of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently issued a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "new Castro, also Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country to replace his older brother Fidel, Ill.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and jailed the same day.
He said that any solution would probably policy and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries begin a better dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men in Afghanistan
Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified an alleged organization prepare a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this case would an important network of terrorist recruiters that Internet in search of young men.
Investigators have said that they were hunting a personality Insurgente hidden, known as Saifullah which invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when one of them made comments endorsing the terrorist waves on the video site YouTube on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men have been guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote area of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home of Al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services has been informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the Al-Qaida commanders that these men were not involved in the conspiracy of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains of northeastern become a shelter of terrorism.
They have been as undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that the men were identified and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations for the entry in Al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law.
The case of the five men - - who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI - - on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of the people's trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services have been a priority for men in the Al-Qaida network.
The organization Recruiters play the role of Gardes-barrières, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may be spies.
According to analysts, the US potential recruits are studied closely by Al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their access to potential American targets and their value Propagandaire.
However Evan Kohlmann, expert of the foundation based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups must also do more and more attention in recent years in the choice of the people they accept as the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow its recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is one that is more and more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen called an "action" on climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants have marched in the streets here Saturday, calling for greater action on the part of negotiators working in the palace of Congress Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists has some explosives near a set of government buildings, in downtown.
On a day when little has happened in the discussions on the climate by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying banners in English saying' there is no Planet B "and in Spanish, saying" the Earth said she has had enough ".
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top model and Danish photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the country of his mother, Peru, has opened our eyes to the problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change is already occurring. "
It is one of the reasons why I decided to join the main march - - to get the word and to appeal to leaders around the world to take the right decisions, ambitious and committed, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in the discussions on climate, activists wearing masks and black clothing, had lit several explosives near the main canal of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by several ministries.
They near the buildings, he said, adding that they were the first rockets, followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the palace of Congress, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it appears that the demonstrators have failed to awaken the conscience of the key authorities such as Su Wei, China representative for the climate.
When he was asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "in fact, this is something that I did not.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "the event is important, I can not hear what is happening outside".
He observed that the march could seem harmful or helpful as prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "You can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they are harmful to the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal differences between the races
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics has brought good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District still far behind the lead institutions, the report shows that the grade 4 and grade 5 (Cm1-cm2) are much greater progress in the past two years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is clear from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress) is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, on both local and national level.
The results of white children in grade 4 () to Washingtond.c. have increased during the past two years, 262 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates increased by only three points, 209 to 212.
The achievement gap has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average score for whites has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not large enough.
The overview over a period of six years is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in grade 4 (), when the first report was published, the district was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results of the children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed the concern that the increase observed by the director of the group of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by the white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we have raised the aggregate in considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that promotes equality in education in the District.
I do not jump for joy for one or two points earned, "said Kwame R. Brown (Democrat), a member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the test results is that middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately in need of attention.
Really, you always see the positive signs and I respect that.
But a fear is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said the district should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson reading system, for classes end of elementary school and early college who not have integrated the Reading earlier in their school and who are behind their peers.
Each day, the mathematics curriculum for grades kindergarten (kindergarten to grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and real life experiences, as they have been put in place in the district by the former superintendent Clifford Janey, which must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better responses to these students below that of the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less success in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of California at Berkeley who is studying the results of the tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to allocate your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting may have political repercussions that impede this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that as the other superintendent of schools, it is trying to use the white and black middle class.
We focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhoods schools to ensure that all families, regardless of where they are from, are assured that their children can get an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the achievement gap étaitla duration of the traditional public school, today of 180 days in the District of Washington, to be in competition with charter schools.
Obtain approximately 200 days to have the strength to change, "said Janey, which came to an agreement with the Union of Teachers last year for 185 days, which it considers a" starting point "for an increase in the next contract.
Make higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, and Cligne a time of eyes at the sight of white columns, brick facades and leafy.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to complete high school, àel Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, when she and other students of Grade 8 (4) of the group have explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38 690 per year, his attitude was less that of a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
This is where I will study! is Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? says, when he the low ratio professor of law student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children during their journey of discovery of three days and now, they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still largely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrants who have left the school where have become parents during adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit of university education that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Hispanic to the" second generation "on Cinqpoursuit his studies at the Lycée - - a significant achievement considering the fact that both of their parents immigrants, most from Mexico or Central America, entered the US without having completed high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they open the way to future generations who will play an important role in the country.
Researchers who study the claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programmes also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like it to reach the university - - in particular, if its efforts are regular and long term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at University of California, Davis, who has studied Latin American students.
We need to provide a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program which funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as the gear up (you), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize programmes of preparation for the university which began when students from low income families are in middle school (College) and continue until the end of years of high school.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent to the university, according to the US Department of Education.
The Iraqi ministry of oil agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over the violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements achieved by the Iraqi oil ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry of Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are left with an interest in only two of 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one that had an auction has lost.
Two American companies have obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of the oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, were of Asian and European companies that are leading the way, "said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a web of information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is being made in Iraq.
The concerns on security, corroborated by coordinated bombings massive, Tuesday, and political instability while the US military troops withdraw have hampered the American oil companies, preventing them from entering with more force in Iraq, which has the third largest oil reserve in the world, analysts say.
The American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and the other energy companies controlled by a government, including labour costs were significantly lower and were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the ministry.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and had offered their technical advice, came away empty-handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more on contracts that other companies and is left with significant holdings in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, "said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will carry out its commitments in Iraq.
The companies to submit auctions have made offers, which were then compared to the price per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate the production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of Al-Qaida was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations of Al-Qaida, this week, said Friday the US authorities of counter-intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh Al-somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles in their car, Tuesday, near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have said that the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They drove a white car, en route to the Afghan border, where the car was hit, said a member of the secret services of Pakistan, speaking on the telephone of Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority said that local militant suspects rushed to place and quickly confiscated what remained of "body completely.
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two representatives Americans have given unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the organizers military officials of Al-Qaida who led the group's terrorist operations outside the region.
Its role was to organize conspiracies around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the instructions of the leaders of Al-Qaida and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had increased rapidly in the ranks of Al-qaida' s and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is perhaps not known to the American public, but that does not take the threat it poses to us and our allies, "said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, would be the second major figure of Al-Qaida or the Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by the CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six months to two operations, according to the figures by the Long War Journal, a Web site by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups who have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also killing informants suspected, the site.
The United Nations special envoy to Kabul withdrew
The United Nations special envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous term marred by allegations of corruption during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure comes at a time when the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase, but it has expressed its concern about the US timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and that would force the other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, to send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, "Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international staff assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign but simply that it would respect the commitment he had made to his family, in March, spend only two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon knows now that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun the search for a replacement.
The representatives say that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it is a citizen who recently chaired a mission of the United Nations in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who had previously led the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied the allegations but he said that the accusations of Galbraith - - who was thanked - - "have damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism with regard to the international observation of éléctions".
Eide said that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the leaders of the United Nations to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide expressed his frustration over the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy hiring regulations of the United Nations hindered its ability to bring new talent.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I could not recruit a single person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it can not last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The secretary of defense, Robert M. Gates said Friday that the major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions on Iran because of its failure to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before a crowd of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a question from a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs me most is that if I learned one thing in Iraq in the past six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians on the street.
He said that a "set of incentives and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would be less good security with nuclear weapons "because" its people would suffer enormously' of the sanctions.
Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences "probable" If it does not back its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only for peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he indicated that it would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to give up a significant part of its store of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed such an agreement, as a means to build confidence on both sides and to gain time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have receded attempts to agreement - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, the stiffening of Iran in the face of some of the proposals of the international community, to which they had in fact given their agreement in early October, has pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before it turns to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called the "increased sanctions".
In a statement made Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations has denounced what it called "baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it was willing to continue the talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term".
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri Al-Maliki, before taking the plane to the rich oil region of Kurdish order Derencontrer the troops to Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions remain between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly on the borders, property rights and the sharing of income.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential in order to avoid any delays of American plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm the anxiety of the Kurds on the withdrawal pending. The American authorities have cited Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you. "
In China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband have grown up surrounded by displays of the propaganda, "the Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "a baby in addition, it is a more".
They have learned the lesson so well that the Shanghai government authorities, alarmed by the inadequate birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their response has been instantaneous and strong: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We do not have any second, said Wang, a 31 - year-old director of human resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed "little emperors", a population crisis facing the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 years and over, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Shanghai municipal population and family planning) said that the fertile couples to have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and to prevent a shortage of labour in the future".
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming "too old - but not as rich, however, that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual mitigation
Written in the constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is, without doubt, the most controversial requirement introduced by the communist government.
The couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines - - up to three times their annual income - - and to suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while the lawyers for human rights have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced women pregnant with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have used selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys, girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, they have paid more exceptions to the rule - - including the residents of the cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which men and women are already unique children - - and in 2007, they have softened many of their slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of Population Research), at Beijing University, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai has become the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, the posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples, in their home, and slipping leaflets under their doors.
It has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The common Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still only four to five applications per month.
Officials of Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165 000 - - slightly higher in 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee in the commune of Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to their first child, she said.
Yang, 27 years and his wife, Liu, 26 years, said they have two children and that they are legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life assurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Western mistakenly see that the one-child policy is a problem of rights, "said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It is true, we are fortunate to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their reluctance.
Wang, responsible for human resources, said that it wanted only one child because she was one herself. "We were the centre of the family and had used that everyone cares."
We do not have the habit of taking care of someone else, and we really do not want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company said more bluntly.
For couples working, middle class, that reduce the birth rate, he says, he must be selfish Pourbien succeed.
People 20 or 30 years have grown up seeing their parents fight in the early days of the capitalist China and do not want to have themselves this way of life, he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of its social life.
Then there are the problems of space - - "You must change your apartment" - - and planning - - "When your child has only 9 months, you should write his CV for a place in the best tongue."
Most of his friends are willing to this experience again, said Chen, but not both.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group of the draft plans for the reduction of emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations - - characterized so far by disorganized and mutual recriminations - - has come under the spotlight Friday, because of the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the coming time.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, highlighted the remaining obstacles, provided it has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that are short of time, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a special working group of the United Nations, the text does not say how much the rich countries would give poor to withstand global warming, in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how the developed economies and emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It provides great flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, Representative àwashington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has produced six pages of the document, considered a text of 180 pages to focus on what was described by the secretary-general on the United Nations climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, during the same period, reduced by 15 to 30 percent.
Overall, the country would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent for 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched the negotiations, Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change - - to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, US representative to the negotiating climate has rejected any discussion forcing the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder to China that the Bush administration has been, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese deputy foreign minister, He Yafei has said that the chief American negotiator, was "common sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the US would not financially China to combat global warming.
With the economic future of the world's major powers involved, defects appeared in the third world both within and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more to the rescue of the individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States on their respective obligations while the poorer nations insist on the fact that the two dozen of the most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more boldly.
Ricardo ulate, a delegate of Costa Rica, stated that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the reduction in greenhouse gases, even if vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It is really a game in which developed a new economic hegemony, said ulate, who is also on the climate adviser for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to press for a treaty requiring legally, in Copenhagen, although most of the key participants say that the negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur, head of the climate unit of the European Commission, said that the action of Small Island States has "put political pressure on the entire political process", in part by what they are now unified and require emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the problems pending before the heads of governments come to an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of the environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister are descended from their plane and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings and conferences of information, in order to make claims that will be considered during the next week.
The true image of the gathering - - in which 13,000 people come in and out of the Palais des Congress each day - - activists guitar players performances mocking countries which according to them, and that proposals are drafted and distributed on paper rather than by mail - - is a real challenge.
The intensity is on the increase: almost all key ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big boys, "said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of Conservation International.
Lorries arrive.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km / h will redefine the syndrome of Monday
A 5h13, Monday morning, a whistle night to signal the start of a process which will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km / h, of Ashford, in Kent to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train javelin outside of London.
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and will connect major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland in London.
The small holes will become of suburban towns, business travel will be much less long and the passage of the plane and the train car will reduce national emissions of carbon, while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties to this project.
But the 10 billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning inevitable and fears of danger to the environment are likely to curb the British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS 2), a company established in January to conduct a feasibility report for the government, will deliver his document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban areas and sites where the impact on the environment will be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres in the final itinerary.
It is also expected that offers three options for a high-speed network more towards the north.
Lord Adonis will in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration for which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line in two at or near Birmingham, with a branch from the west of the Pennines àmanchester and Scotland and another towards the Northeast, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best option of performance' said a professional rail.
When this is completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one hour currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel to 400km / H, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains to long and capable of carrying 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line from London to Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis announce whether or not he feels that the project should be put in place, but more extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Although the machine, the network will be built by party.
The trains will initially be forced to roll out of high-speed lines on existing track north of Birmingham, journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This seems to be the best solution for ensuring a passage from planes to trains, constitute a point of reference for the rail revolution.
The taxpayers repay the loan of GBP for the Orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, senior Tory member of parliament, made payable to the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of a Orangerie that it has built at his home in his constituency.
The head of the party who was demoted by David Cameron for having complained that members of parliament were "maintained", has increased its loan of GBP 75,000 to build an extension in oak at his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to make additional pay the interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities have received complaints at the time and have not been asked by Sir Thomas Legg, which control of members expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan said that the complaints could not be "more clear or simple."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, is the owner of a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a lounge and dining room, but the fees office said that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, it added a veranda at the house, describing in its plans as a Orangeraie.
The neighbours described it as a "porch for fun".
It has not been asked Mr. Duncan to give an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation made by the Committee of Standards and Privileges of the Commons, on its loan provisions.
The Committee has cleared last month of any accusation of non-compliance with the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan has changed the legal security of borrowing 271.406 GBP of its London to his constituency home that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately GBP per month interest until March of last year.
In April, its applications have increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS Mr. Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the borrowing of GBP.
The interest rate standard variable RBS from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March, this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to ask 1.250 GBP in May.
Mr. Duncan has lost his position as head of the shadow cabinet in September, after a journalist under the cover supposedly filmed declaring that members of parliament were to survive "on budget" after the expenses scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you have to live" on budget "and you are treated as" M ... E "
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and I asked a small party, based on what was right.
And I could ask more, but I have not done. "
The member of parliament, millionaire from his former post as an oil trader, has begun to explain its spending, in May, after it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist has dug a hole in the form of GBP in the lawn of M Duncan, in protest after it was revealed that he had requested 4,000 GBP for three years.
Questioned on the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for improvements capitals, approved by both the office of then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of avoidance or development or use of rules or anything like that.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
This could not be clearer or more simple. "
Worshippers, all see the Advent calendar of Brighton
The cabins of Brighton beach have found a new way of promotion for the winter months, a timetable for the interactive.
Beyond, a group of alternative church that encourages the spiritual exploration by the creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using as a theme, the songs of Noel.

Martin Poole, 50, a marketing assistant TV of Hove, is a non-paid priest of the Diocese of Chichester and director of beyond.
He said: "We want religion is closer to the people in a society Post-chrétienté.
"As a church, why do we expect that people go into a strange old building? it seems to me that the church should get closer to the people and celebrate in a more exciting.
"The idea of the advent of the beach came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is a creative place and vibrant and we are trying to experiment and to represent this through spirituality. "
Late payments: anger prison guards, actions
The prison guards' unions called Friday for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of year holidays bonuses and overtime which payment has been deferred to January for budgetary reasons.
Fo-pénitentiaire (2 nd Union) has asked the personnel who will not be in service Tuesday morning in prisons and the "block", to "denounce the theft of their due".
The Cgt-pénitentiaire (3rd of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in different prisons for strong mobilization", saying "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of' overtime, bonuses for night, Sundays and holidays "in October.
And the first union of Supervisors, the European autonomous federal prison (UFAP /), "calls for general mobilization (...) to the dissatisfaction and anger".
The prison administration and the Ministry of Justice explained that the additional hours have increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the leftovers will be paid in January.
The chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to unions of their supervisors to ensure that the payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by staff for the operation and the modernisation of our prison system, the minister of justice in the mail.
I asked the Department of prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation born of a poor assessment of the number of overtime not repeated in the future, added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The pay in December will be lean, except for the personal direction the famous premiums of functions and objectives, deplored the UFAP / UNSA, for which "budgetary constraints have good backs."
It is a pure scandal, has outraged the European Interregional fo of Marseille, in announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and".
The staff will not work on Sundays and public holidays if those of October are not regularised in December, ditto for overtime, also threatens fo Rhône-alpes-auvergne.
At a time when increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare attack the staff, said the Cgt-pénitentiaire of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less badly off than others.
But in any case it is not, noted the secretary-general of the UFAP, Jean-François forget.
For Christmas, Obama said offer "more" than those it receives
US President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas as a family in the White House, gave the "Papesse" the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule on gifts: "I give more than I get."
In the framework of a special programme to be broadcast Sunday night on the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle provide an overview of how they intend to celebrate the Christmas and new year in their new and prestigious remains.
Even Bo, the small companion to four legs of the family will be of the party.
The Father Christmas also like Bo, said Michelle Obama, specifying that the dog would "of course" a gift, according to excerpts of the broadcast released in advance.
And Michelle Obama took issue with the assertions made by her husband about the quality of the gifts that it receives: "Certainly not, I offered you gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to concede before respond with humor by pointing a finger at the neck of the first lady: "Who did you offer that?".
During the broadcast of one hour for the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous moderator who has been a staunch support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife were also their favourite gifts as children.
Barack Obama has raised a ten speeds, but also a basket ball that his Kenyan father he has rarely seen offered to Christmas.
I remember the time I met my father came to see us for Christmas and it gave me a basket ball, the president said.
It was not until much later in my life that I realized that it was he who had given me the ball.
The first lady was on its side of her doll house.

But Mr. Wells had finally declared the end of September had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event the court refuses to dismiss the case, Mr. Hummel has demanded a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his arguments.
The prosecution has also reiterated the arguments already developed in the first instance, namely that no charges could not be seriously considered as Roman Polanski would not be before the court.

Recalling that his client no longer bear to be harassed in each of the Polanski case, she added: "Nobody in this room can not say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough ".

News of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive", according to his son David
News of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive", assured Friday his son David to his arrival at the airport in Los Angeles where he was to go to his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong, it is going very well, told the press David Hallyday to its exit of the plane that took her to Paris shortly after 1:00 pm local (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, looking relaxed, assured that he would make "very quickly" to the hospital Cedars-sinaï of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection resulting from the operation for a slipped disk in Paris on 26 November.
The singer has been "placed in artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for a reason comfort, to prevent suffering and to administer his treatment", said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors at the hospital Cedars-sinaï of Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection resulting from the operation for a slipped disk in Paris on 26 November.
The singer had to be on the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning at the Lycée Français de Los Angeles where is their daughter Jade, to attend a school, found a photographer of AFP.
The head of orthopaedic surgery and trauma of the hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has violently put the Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November international clinical the Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that this was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, "said Mr Camus.
I have heard talk of a possible future court proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was "much too quickly to Los Angeles, with the permission of the surgeon.
I had this doctor in person in line who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed, since I had two hernia, he added.
Recently on RTL, it had indicated that the singer was apparently "party without drain, nothing", after his operation.
The Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic community.
It had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic to which he was at the time.
In 2007, it had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to a haematoma following a cerebral haemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor reputation, condemned on several occasions by the justice, in medical liability and for tax evasion and fraud.
I Olivier Metzner, counsel for the order of doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" continued "regularly" to the Council of the order, and that is "not be advisable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well" and that examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore does not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems are growing since this summer, appears in brackets.
Clearly, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, Stitch) as planned, it seems very short, Mr Camus said.
The association UDF increase the tone and the new centre to use its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the Modem party of François Bayrou, reacted Friday to the attempted takeover of the president of the new centre, Hervé Morin, the acronym of the Giscardien, by putting remains to be used on any medium, on pain of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym UDF, ruling that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after having reached out to the left.
The defence minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he has received the support of the member Hervé de Charette (Ex-ump past the NC) which claims ownership of the mark to have been the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the association, controlled by the Friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to let, is out of her silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and member, not to use the acronym and to transfer the ownership of the mark, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, statements indicating that you would propose to your political movement to resume + the acronym UDF, the association wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez the modem, and Senator Jean of the centrist alliance.
You have also seen fit to follow up on your equipment activist and on the title page of your site, the name of the movement, the new centre +, + today the UDF +, also the signatories to the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of the acronym, said the office of the UDF, which remains the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of any medium and (its) Web site.
It also calls on Mr Hervé de Charette "to convey the property of (the) marks its legitimate right".
If you did not, the courts would be to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent the signatories.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and its friends had "made the choice" to leave in 2007 "to create a movement competitor, as others had done in 2002, to create the ump".
The new centre has therefore, in their view, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French democracy).
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d' Estaing.
To Mr Hervé de Charette, pursuing the office, "when he filed the mark", it was "more of the UDF over the past three years", but to the UMP.
It benefits and fraudulently abscence of the deposit of the acronym UDF to do.
This is in the process of becoming crime, Dénoncent-ils, before the strategy of NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more fit to make a name for yourself to try to break the anonymity fraudulently taking a name which was not right".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The tribunal of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist Banier to determine if, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a weakness of the state to deprive a part of his fortune.
The 62 - year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and a fine of EUR 375 000.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which Mother and daughter will snap while taking the reins of the cosmetics empire L' Oreal.
But the 15th Correctional chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, should be conducted by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L' Oreal has always refused to submit to such a review, at least not in the conditions proposed by the public prosecutor's office in Nanterre in the investigation.
Doctors Friday will submit a report before the 10 March 2010, saying, for example, if Liliane Bettencourt could be in a weak state and at what times.
I think it will.
I will talk to him, said the exit of the hearing counsel for Ms. Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman.
For its part, counsel for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, I Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...) the expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) has handled this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has committed criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist, which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain one billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, contracts of life insurance or tables.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, as an old friend.
While the tribunal should consider the admissibility of the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers have sometimes turned into a large family unpacking Friday.
As well, the lawyer Liliane Bettencourt reported three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to its notary, in which it said suspicious of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage ".
For its part, the prosecutor's office in Nanterre again took the view that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially as a guardianship judge has refused in recent days to accede to its request to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act to justice, it is not under protection and does not have a guardian.
No one else has to act in his place, "said the representative of the public ministry, Marie-chrsitine Daubigney.
The court has finally decided that it would decide once the trial will be held on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial Revolution or end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large enterprises vis-à-vis its employees, recalls the position vis-à-vis consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to "values" determined from above as they once were, to impose products to consumers by technicians of the plant.
By putting the customer at the heart of the business, the revolution handed the marketing strategies of conquest of the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors of return regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which affects.
This seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including the R & D and, more importantly, the economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE "requires of all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a prospective vision"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that the authoritarian management completely.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put the staff at the centre of the concerns of the business as the client.
The relative opinion surveys
The internal opinion surveys as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its Salariés- going to this revolution in the managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
- firstly because I could see that, faced with a new situation, any structure in the end, after many detours, priority ... what it has always done.!
- Secondly, because the authoritarianism one of the pathologies of increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
Major schools of engineering, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory Behavioriste, recently revived by the "Neuroscience" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes and the media.
As well, suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) the commitment of managers, a recent survey by Ipsos published in the Figaro.fr Conforte-t-elle leaders in a governance posture, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure the factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, to adopt a vision of human behaviour.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is possible only if it is clear as a means to achieve some of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the analysis Motifonctionnelle adopt this design of employees.
These studies have demonstrated that they consider their business based on a predetermined which allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their projects to life.
Through the identification and measurement of these factors mobilization, business leaders can monitor, forecast and anticipate their social "performance" and their management of human resources "to".
They create a breeding ground for joint development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: the "just war" is worth of praise to right to Obama
The American right has welcomed Friday the speech the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize, has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, the former candidate for vice-president in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, "said Ms. Palin, the right wing of the Republican party, the daily USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the theme of war" sometimes necessary "in his memoirs which have just been published.
The war is obviously the last thing in my view that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists while there, she said.
Mr. Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, suggested that the president had made in Oslo "a very good job".
I found that the speech was very well, welcomed the former speaker of the House of Representatives, which has especially appreciated the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential connection.
By some side, I found this speech historic, "said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio" The takeaway ".
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he is delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" to remind members of the Nobel committee "that they would not be free and could not put a price of peace if the use of force did not exist.
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush columnist for The Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered "a very American" speech.
In addition to appear in "Citizen of the world" as "it always does," he spoke as a US president ", recalling the Europeans that they live in a bubble of security that they have not established and that they do little to preserve it," said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few to right to not be convinced, a Falcon of the Bush era, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, called the speech "dull, and without inspiration" on the National Review Online.
Has the left of the president, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When the war in the concept of justice, can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he cautioned.
The press remained against the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was awarded to Mr. Obama, described his address of "blockbuster" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," ignited the Daily Californian.
Mr. Obama "has delivered the speech that it was," said the New York Times, "both dark and inspiring".
Road: three marathons for an agreement that saves the supply of Christmas
After three sessions, the road sector unions and employers, as the only organization to be continued until the end, reached an agreement Friday night to end the strike and the threat to the supply of Christmas.
At the meeting of signatures Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "pleased" of the agreement, after several rounds of negotiations, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators had left in the early morning Friday, with the hope of signing quickly at the end of the morning the text of the agreement.
And even if three employers organisations (FNTR, Unostra, Otre) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting that began at 11 a.m so that everyone is in agreement and that the text should be signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for business" and "it was feared that it Vienna disrupt the Christmas and New Years," said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in the local and regional road transport), and 2.9 per cent for the highest international (transport).
In hourly rate, for, "from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It is not much, but it is very far, explained Patrice closed (FO).
It will give the order to our activists that there is no bottlenecks, no blockade of centres of supplies.
But can always be some who are not happy, he added.
Philippe, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even though it was "difficult to concede the increases on the high salaries in the context of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of EUR 170 monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and the respect of employees, "said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) has welcomed" a historic agreement ".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of the travel expenses of 3%, and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will include the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau reiterated that "a decrease of EUR 100 million in employers' has been the subject of a Government amendment to draft amending finance law for 2009, voted in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in terms identical".
The signing of TLF provides that the agreement applies to the member companies to this organization, and in a second time, the entire profession, in the case of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible", assured Mr Bussereau.
The opposition employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR has denounced a "fool's bargain", since the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has obliged us to negotiate in L? urgency, not a shared analysis, but not to thwart the eaters of the next, deplored the Unostra.
In Ur, the agreement "to dig the grave D? a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months.
A: this weekend, unions of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER, the largest urban transit line of France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting Friday on the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP left on their hunger on their demand for premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for an important weekend for purchases before Christmas, there will be no trains between and, a train on two on the central portion (between defence and nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
The Galleries Lafayette, awaiting 200,000 customers each day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP efforts to serve the department stores".
The RER A from West to East the Paris.
The RATP short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to and Marne-la-Vallée.
Friday, about one train in two was circulated during peak hours, and virtually no hours, as planned.
As Thursday, there has been no congestion on the docks, is being organized.
And in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less busy than usual, especially because of the absence of pupils and students.
A (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29 - year-old engineer, explained to be lifted "an hour and a half earlier, so be sure to arrive on time.
The station has not saturation, "said the SNCF, which had planned a agents and security forces.
The RER has operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-le-haut arrived or departed from the station Saint-Lazare to join the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will discuss the results, considered "by the unions, a meeting with management Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a protocol specific to the RER has on all aspects, working time, career path etc.
This is not what the drivers want, who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP is even its proposals Premium brackets, has outraged the CGT, stressing that the management "was not to solve a problem in the road and the SNCF is done."
A new meeting is planned Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", said the RATP.
What has made the unions say that the company "had defied the users of the weekend.
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
When the leadership, which until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in an effort to restore calm" the meeting.

The Turkish Justice dissolved the Pro-Kurdish party, decision fraught with consequences
The Turkish constitutional court has delivered Friday the dissolution of the country's main Pro-Kurdish party, a decision which was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is to reach out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) has been dissolved because it had become a "home of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said to the press the president of the court Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to advise the dissolution, Mr Kiliç said, adding that 37 of party executives, including its president Ahmet Türk and member Tugluk, are banned from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the property of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in parliament (550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that members of the parliament rather than sit as members of Parliament without label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the Court of Cassation prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, which accused the DTP to obey the "guidelines" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, that there was "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The court verdict comes as the government is to reach out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, in an attempt to dry up the support of the Kurds to the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had said that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the south-east Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
After the announcement of Justice, about 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the main city in the Southeast majority of Kurds.
The security forces fired tear gas and used water cannons, while demonstrators were throwing Molotov cocktails and stones with slingshots.
About 100 people demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of Justice would "deepen the despair".
Turkey can not solve the Kurdish question (,) by banning a party, he said to the Press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This resolves nothing, "said Minister for Energy Taner.
This decision is a total of democratic openness launched by the government, "said the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The new "Silicon-Valley"
For a long time she had the reputation of secret City, closed to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place of secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today with its 216 000 inhabitants at 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the "Silicon Valley" of the Soviet Union.
Centres of production and micro - and nanoelectronics are located.
In September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, place science Mehr with academic institutes and companies of the centre of Frankfurt (FIZ).
There have been meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a protocol of close collaboration.
The signatories were the vice mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of section project for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will enable the companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
Unlike the Russian scientific societies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of research institutes and companies Soviet famous.
There is the Institute of Electrical Engineering from Moscow, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-elektronika.
The joint was founded in 1958 as "socialist planned city" for research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") gets its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which research centres are established.
The project: a brake for Stuttgart
Can not place high the magnitude of the Stuttgart 21 project.
To its supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe.
If. Is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, in a hopeless chaos of for 10 years.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The stations head of the line, with routes that ended in the city, had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technical transport of the 19th century that were effect of brake of the modern rail traffic because it was once a lot of time to get the back to the front.
Arrival, stopping short, departure that is what needs to be done.
That is why the head of the line must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart also: a station of passage of trains, which is about halfway on the Trans-European rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "the heart of Europe".
The project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the head of the line no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with and Voiture-pilote at both ends.
However this launches the achievement of Stuttgart 21 next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and communal policies prevailed.
The railway company is in part because it is the taxpayer who paid the cost of the largest infrastructure project of the federal republic and not the public company.
From the point of view the project is relatively well justified.
You get an urban space which according to the planners generated by computer will be very.
For the rail transport system the S 21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the enlargement of the section are designed for trafficking is - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time there was no competition from cheap flights.
The modern traffic policy should continue to focus on strengthening the traffic of goods for transport by rail is more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, not suitable for freight trains.
The S 21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be submerged in the draft.
This is the official figure.
Experts agree that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade the money for other points of junction and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport in 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 kilometres.
Since 1987 the line is built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to support here to build on the fungus.
But the project is a braking.
The route of the Rhine valley is on track to become the bottleneck of international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the land government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgement of the administrative court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The economics minister Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the coalition CDU / FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the judgement of the administrative tribunal and is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel court justified in a written document that the land should adapt the rules on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the runway Aterrissage northwest of Frankfurt airport would be reached.
The authority to Attérir for 17 aircraft between 11:00 p.m. and 5 H in the morning, as envisaged by the government of the land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air pollution at night.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal in Cassation against the judgment.
The opposition criticism this time and trying to put pressure on the government representative for that Celui-cirenonce to appeal to the federal administrative court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and that was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be Condidéré as a total failure to a given floor.
It is difficult to be allowed to keep its word, "said the head of the greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP" We keep our promises ".
The minister Dieter Posch denies the accusations of Schäfer-gümbel who claims that the land government tries to even the night flights using "Avocasserie and Roublardises".
It takes time to conduct a legal review.
The coalition does not take a decision on the basis of a "first impression.
The decision must be legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of its share on the prohibition of night flights is completely.
US banks repay aid
The big US banks, very affected by the crisis, their relationship vis-à-vis the state.
Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid in the framework of the rescue plan.
The chain of American television CNBC reported in a story that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions seeking to get rid of the restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to the leader as well as the settlement of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors reported $19 billion of new money.
The remainder comes from the coffers of the bank are met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis the director general of the Bank of America held specifically to thank the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to raise money on financial markets to free themselves from the guardianship of the state.
The American bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of $20 billion, the CNBC citing banking circles.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Election
Finally it even faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current holding of the post of chief writer Nikolaus Brender by the board of the German ZDF, the successor is appointed.
The Commission wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the drafting of ZDF was the big favorite.
The chain has not officially confirm - - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further damage to the ZDF Markus Schächter if the proposal would not be accepted by the executive board.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needs the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the executive board to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender but this had been rejected.
Only 7 council members had expressed support for the continuation of Brender and 7 others had voted against the dismissal by a vote of Brender represented a massive failure while predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU majority on the board of directors had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to renew his position.
This is Roland Koch, the minister-president of the land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor in chief.
He denied that the contract of the highly regarded chief writer is extended in arguing that the rate of information viewing of the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
This is the reason for the protests were still taking place, almost up to the vote, denouncing the growing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law that had intruded in the debate and who felt that the action of Koch was unconstitutional.
But it will amount to nothing.
Peter Frey: Who is it?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957.
He studied the, pedagogy romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked in Südwestfunk (radio body of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau daily (German national in scope).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF first to the news magazine "Heute-journal" Today (journal).
Then his journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991 and 1992, then until 1998 he was head and presenter of "Morgenmagazins" (emission information presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the then head of the editor.
After the disgrace of Brender, which had just been elected journalist of the year by the trade magazine medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
opponent to the governing council, the premier of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF intergovernmental treaty so that the proposals of the staff can not be blocked by a political majority.
However, Beck has no plans to seek the withdrawal of political figures who are members of the monitoring committees of the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender had skilfully manoeuvred to the board in criticizing the Commission in its decision to sack Brender.
This evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was in a position to propose for the position of editor without losing face, as well as the board could elect without being able to post a political supporter.
In the representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal left.
Cleansing in academic studies
partial success for students: After a year of educational strike the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the ministers and delegates of the conference of rectors, an agreement was drawn up stipulating that the working conditions of students bachelor or master needed to be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
In particular, they have been Accordpour the burden of reviews: a single review is to close the study module chosen.
In addition, the workload will be Reconsidée to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
The political authorities and institutions of higher education want to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder are also committed to structural requirements more flexible for the courses of bachelor and master.
At the regional level, there should not be any different from one land to another.
Reviews
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the minister of education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have repeatedly to mouth the catchword: "étudiabilité".
But for the first time, this expression seems to be a concrete meaning.
The accreditation council decided to significantly reduce the number of some reviews: "Each module should normally be concluded by a single consideration," reads a document of about 30 pages on future conditions of admission to the university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, president of the accreditation council said that by significantly reducing the burden of reviews should be able to stop the abuses, which significantly the étudiabilité.
The "étudiabilité" should also be, in the future, the decisive criterion of the organization of studies.
The modules as the substance should be carefully examined to see if we can not avoid this feeling of suffocation that sometimes in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / BERLIN - according to the latest knowledge in raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the minister of defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the flexibility to allow and encourage the personal initiative".
The new regulation will access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "Réaccrédités" every 5 years, which means that it is, however, that by 2015 all cycles have been considered.
There are 10 of accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which depend on the Accreditation Council created by the Länder.
In October, the ministers of education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies to ensure that the programmes are not too loaded and the regime of reviews not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized schools have already agreed with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only land that has agreed to grant more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programmes Tutorielset strengthen the educational guidance offices as well as the offices of reviews and the international relations
The Länder and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
Early 2010, the government wants to table in parliament an amendment to the law on higher education.
As a result, there will be no more one consideration to complete his studies.
The organization of studies to be more flexible, it must be able to ensure the recognition of other institutions of higher education and access to the master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, L' étudiabilité "University graduate, will be considered.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have once again discussed the issue of conditions in the country.
The Décisionsont been appreciated but critical voices were heard.
The federal president of the student union indicated that he would like the Organization of the education policy does not happen in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and rectors of universities.
After the strike, students as individuals should be able to speak a little.
The future of higher education received the support of the president of the delegates of the conference of rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the student experience is very helpful to us," she said Thursday during a meeting with the ministers of education of the Länder with which the HRK working on a common reform.
For the Union of education and science (gew) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It calls the right and the opportunity for each graduate to enroll in a master cycle.
Andreas Keller member of the steering committee of the request that the Länder ensure students of today, tomorrow there will be enough places for master studies and studies as good as possible.
The Länder have to hire more lecturers.
However, the ministers of education have not raised the possibility of easing access to the master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control ... "that began a work of poet Werner Söllner, in which it in snippets of sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany and won the freedom but at the same time has lost its linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary award; in 1993 it was the highly coveted chair of poetry of Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he is director of the forum of Hesse home of artist Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
There has been much talk about him in circles not literary last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "the German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror of your files.
Visibly upset and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers Germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informer for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received in 1989 the price of the German language together with some of the participants.
Tests began in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner "So someone who has not sufficiently stood intimidation of the Securitate.
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (Im Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the Honoration of the Nobel prize for Herta Müller and his literary copies with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly shows the abyss and of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as can be said with the current state of knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own Securitate file, Im Walter played a role, the literature specialist Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of Im Walter who had interceded on his behalf.
"He had drawn from all the difficult situations at the time, according to Markel.
Markel has felt the need Moralde make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident its collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the journal "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of his own record.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculation and will sometimes guessed what real names were hiding last names of borrowing Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to Germany where between time the consultation of the files of the Stasi is a reliable process, the attitude to the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification was constantly frustrated and in past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council representing the institution Birthler has been established to work on the assimilation of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) but the return of the files has rather languished since.
Since 2005 there is a law which defines the management of archives.
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by an interview with a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar which, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed in a very dismissive of the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end it had questioned only once.
The infamy of power to speak here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many issues are associated with the case Söllner as happens so often in a context of guilt.
Why now? was? the weighted reaction of listeners, the admission of Söllner, suggest that the remainder of this chapter will be defined more by a desire to know that accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
The Champions League
had the impression that a representative here, printed in four pins from any right to a Christmas party, on which the manufacturer of sports had spread its goods when the new coach Christian Gross at midnight quarter in a Mercedes C Class, he had just call, a plastic bag orange supplier by hand.
The man, whose skull chauve drew attention, driving in the city that he was still foreign.
Otherwise we could have taken the wheel he had not been drinking alcohol and he was not drunk with happiness.
He had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow should return to work.
Because it is now that it would start.
The words of Switzerland that had just three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the final eighth of", that is to say in the Champions League through our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "But we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by success. This will be a brutal fight to avoid falling back."
The "big job" lies ahead Sunday.
Here, it is to repeat the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11)
drawing of lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (game go / + 23. / 24 February / return match 9 / 10 + / 17 March) will be drawn by lot on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the inauguration of the successor of Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not only among those who had chance, which had forwarded professionals Stuttgart, unfailing motivation and good fun.
I went to see the players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the plumber of Souls "gross - the recipe for success that sounded if Bienmais who did more effects with the Babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic, Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel - "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible".
Sami and Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, as one of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" found by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the method of work of the new leader: "He is someone who is taking action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation.
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet turned the corner, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart is especially in need of tenacity.
As Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overstate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before they have had four days later a bad awakening to Leverkusen with 0: 4, objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, that they had reached one of the goals of the season but that they had others that were still far away.
We have not yet out of the woods yet.
That Heldt the day of its 40th anniversary does not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home over the past three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview of the goal keeper Jens Lehmann did rebound just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens, Heldt, in response to criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the leadership of style and said that it had decided to change coach under pressure from fans.
Lehmann had also seen as a sign of lack of sovereignty and Jalousiele that his day of freedom after the matches had been deleted.
The statements of Lehmann were "marked by a pure selfishness" Heldt and announced the consequences for goalkeeper.
They could not become friends for life these two.
In all, they agreed to all the rest, that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong representation and would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have been "a large part in the success" Heldt and Lehmann in choir and even the man in the plastic bag.
World championship heavy
Hot in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly verbally and Gestuellement the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after 12 rounds difficult the Ukrainian defended his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles from the version of the Federation.
The judges in the points.
Hamburg Vitali Klitschko retains his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles.
The federation announced that on the night of Saturday, the 38 - year-old champion had won a victory to the Unaminité of judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).
For the third time Klitschko defended with honour the title since her comeback on stage in October 2008.
The Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion of the WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately it has not managed the long-awaited KB.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 fighting professionals, twice its defeat because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept its first defeat in 24th fight.
In the Berne arena, before 17,000 spectators, the mainly wanted to dictate the fight, from its high 2.02 metres, against the left.
Johnson, 11 centimetres smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the era Klitschko, managed to avoid the champion, Empéchant well Klitschko to bring into its game against right-wing Dangeureuse.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has tried to move the rounds.
Although he continued to lead in words and gestures its assault reached only very rarely the champion.
It is the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, have exceeded with the distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
It Insulta Klitschko the dealing of "zombie" which "is not really capable.
During the weighing Friday, the champion could not help but provoke Johnson by his sunglasses nose "to see his eyes.
Fourth victory since the comeback of Klitschko.
Klitschko imposed again in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "its" WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without a struggle.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola us.
"I just took a shot in this fight, and am in perfect form had said Klitschko to explain his rapid return to the ring.
His Rève is to try to bring in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Hague who, having Détroné the General Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 metres - in November, is the belt.
This summer, Hague had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko to take place in September.
It would appear that his promotion company plans to play this match at Wembley in London.
The case Kunduz
frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the parliamentary group of the greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the minister of defence of lying in the case of Kunduz.
The SPD party and the Left party (Die Linke) called on the Chancellor of explanations.
Hamburg / BERLIN - after reviewing the latest information on the air strike in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the minister of defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) have Délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The minister has intentionally "made an untruth" on the lethal strike of two tankers last September, said the head of the parliamentary group of the greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the emission of information of the ARD "Tagesschau" (the newspaper).
That means that he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
It is, in substance, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of Lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but was to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the report of NATO, 142 people had been killed or injured in the US air attack that was launched at the request of the German colonel Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the left have requested Saturday the chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to take a decision as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party, Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must clearly say if the strategy of targeted killing is part of the government's Afghan policy if the Chancery, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The government spokesman categorically rejects such criticism.
The chancellery has no influenced the Army in Afghanistan, has said.
Saturday, there were more and more strong to express Doutesquant the real reasons of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as had been submitted by the ministry.
According to the information of the journal Spiegel, the information they had provided to Guttenberg on the attack tankers were both correct and complete.
Officially, they have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and hidden some details.
In the entourage of two senior officials suggests that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner" reports that would have meanwhile asked in a letter clarifying facts.
So far, it has not received a reply
Saturday, the ministry did not wish to comment on the charges and referred to the federal parliament's committee of inquiry that would be the following Wednesday to the light on the facts.
The dream worlds
Some see, awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is not that among ill, or under the influence of drugs, the boundaries between fantasy and reality blur.
As these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying in our rooms, we can indulge without dreams and the wildest fantasies.
However, awake, been the experience of a dream, hears and sees things that others do not, reputation in our western world to be mad or drugged, or at the very least to be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear that among ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination: it is the same neural activity which allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but that sometimes the line between the dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious, in the form of a dream, can be in various forms, in the best case we call them visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect stand, visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet of the new age Carlos Castaneda, the latter, psychosis and hallucinations are attributable to very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, substances of the brain - the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and Achétylcholine - and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The land force of attraction has more power on the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of Rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great resemblance between the madness and the dream", for Sigmund Freud's dream was "a psychosis with all irregularities, imagination, delusions and sensory illusions that".
We are in fall 2001 when Henning t turns into a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions to the colours.
The attraction has more power on him in the ceiling.
It feels a coup.
Behind him creatures Ailées, Grimaçantes, his mouth bloodied, showing teeth.
They continue, give the shots feet with heavy boots, the cast against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Voice,,, walls and the radio.
It can no longer bear those voices that the insult and humiliate.
Henning T. two cables its chain, made a loop and attached to a hook attached to the ceiling.
It rises on a baffle and is the loop around the neck.
He leaps.
The loop stands out.
That serve as a lesson, the voices in a chorus to the tympanum. "In a clinic and treat!"
Today Henning T. 40 years, he lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: psychosis schizo-affective, paranoid, it is, he takes medication for depression, mania and schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced the terrible fears and profound despair.
The Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in his life; in psychiatric clinics that is the most common illness after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer tell the difference between the inside and the outside world, they are in a state of hyper excitation, that they may suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational or persecution.
It is very common to hear the voice of votes, or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person can no longer distinguish between the important and the trivial, the brain can not filter out signals, is deluged the sensations.
As the dream, psychosis opens the gates to a tide of ideas and fantasies deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the issue, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry of Heidelberg Chu (Allgemeine psychiatry Im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the middle of the situation, meaning focused on him.
At the same time it is in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and can not act on them in an active way.
This is the reason why people with schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust the reality, the Illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
Once in a lifetime experience of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, the sensory structure and space to the reality that is seen during the psychosis, is fundamentally retained ".
The thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of lived in a real framework.
Why our brain such antics, is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional situations can bring everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
The researchers assume that the people involved are tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that the neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explained Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the anomaly of the system occurs and also the fact that it is not for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, however, if there is a predisposition.
The hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains.
This is crazy, we said the psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that the psychotic suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to dispose of while others buy drugs very expensive to obtain.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant of illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings together for ten years of reports on the hallucinations and phenomena of images: Last year he published his results in a book entitled "the world in our heads."
The hallucinations are part of concomitant phenomena typical of psychosis but also to an impressive number of other diseases.
They include the psychological problems such as borderline or depression but also the migraine headaches, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or trauma.
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of fragments of memories that normally are inhibited.
They form when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions, are HyperActives or not enough Refrénées; when our brain but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis.
But the lack of stimulus, stress, to love or other mental states.
In recent studies, a third of the participants acknowledged having made at least once in a lifetime experience of a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years, she lives in a small town in earlier and it goes to high school.
A young girl to normal indeed.
If there was not the images and voices.
During a break, sometimes a boy, thin, with long hair Châtain, address him the floor.
When she meets his watch it, surprised no one else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that this girl is a lunatic but Sarah K do not dream, it is certain.
She is awake, hears and sees the boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to her on the bench.
It may even receive his presence.
It is a good feeling, she found that young sympathetic.
Am I mad?, wondered sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night the appearances are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When she is in class, it is that it can monitor the course because the professor is just to present a new student in his eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly in the process to explain equations in table.
The night the appearances are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of his room, she looked sleep that comes too rarely and far too late, it often can not distinguish whether it is or dream already, if the images she saw, the faces Grimaçants or the girl with cuts on his arms and legs are before its eyes open or closed.
Let me quiet, Cree these creatures.
It does not mention it to his parents or friends, they would take to a mad.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
It was last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since it came into contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have sufficient incentives, the likelihood is great that he hallucinations after a certain time.
I assume that the brain is not enough, that there is animation.
Sarah K., single girl, was afraid of the other children when she was small and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, that the man she called Papa, since it was age, was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual hallucinations and acoustic, and for the impressions and real, it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to the difference between illusion and reality. "Each experience", "a place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten night, dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, mentally healthy person is able to recognize that the fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience was unfortunately quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic of Forensic Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-degenhard has studied the form of so-called experience Oniroïde, a particular form of the conscience of the dream.
The experienced Oniroïdes are Semi-rêves very complex which are seen as real by the lives and that it can not distinguish a dream even when it is in a state of awakening.
The state of consciousness Oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with Polyradiculopathie which fully aware, experience a paralysis engine.
According to Schmidt-degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world, due to a comprehensive and lasting inability to move, it replaces the real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is divorced from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, a form of intense and means of interpretation, in a situation intolerable in itself, an organizational capacity that is given us men, not to sink into the none of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian also describes his experiences Oniroïdes in his book "change of heart" as a safeguard action of the soul.
He was 49 years, when his hand for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain in intensive care.
Claussen plunged into a world that he created from scratch, visit foreign places, travel in time. It is in old man in a sanatorium, a robot at his bedside on his health.
He lives in the middle ages among the noble who manufacture of narcotic drugs based on blood.
It is abducted by a Greek to who takes in his country, he is riding with his hospital bed in the Alps and meeting a Korean Mafia.
It is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to these domestic travel are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, "he wrote in describing what he lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from travel disorders are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
Can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real lived.
The intensity of the detonated the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-degenhard.
Ultimately, the delusions Oniroïdes, psychosis, hallucinations and experiences we show how our internal representations of the external reality are fragile even on stand by.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
Experience that can also be very rewarding.
The first snow may fall

A 27 years, the children will following the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the position of CEO of editions Burda is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wishes that his two children resume the press group, he said the journal Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - in the long term, the publisher Hubert sees his company in the hands of its children
The two children will inherit 27 years and are committed to integrate the society, said Hubert Burda, 69 years, Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will.
It also will have to see if they are capable of.
We can not impose its children to 7,500 staff without knowing if they have the capacity to deal with them.
This demolish the children as well as the company.
Had informed last Thursday that he withdrew from the position in January and that his successor was Paul-bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years, is a member of the Board since 1999.
First it was responsible for the technology sector.
He held the sector that is to say that he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he was also the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
For the first time this is not a member of the family which is at the head of editions.
Children have 19 and 17 years respectively, his son Felix would now 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the link for the next 10 or 15 years "
said that the holding should remain 100 per cent in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always held in families that are left by a capital bulimia, which have made enormous speculation thinking that they could climb ever higher.
It has never been my strategy.
I have never had Rêvede universal power, said Burda.
I do not see myself in the role of the country as could be and I do not intend to be part of the leagues international as Time magazine, these companies have taken too much importance.
The promise of Fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device which allows only to look at his e-mail, without offering the possibility if only to see some type of attachments or surf the Internet.
It took its five minutes of fame in the United States, where Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, peek offers a price and a monthly subscription very low, less than half the cost, for example, the subscription for the IPhone.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service to life, for six times more than the Peek.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is as limited as its Grand-frère American, but is a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with already know what it means to relinquish the data when you cross a border or seek a cafeteria on the WiFi (or a connection of FON) to consult his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is a long time that it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but for me, I would need to have a PhD in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated call to order the European Commission to propose affordable roaming fees across Europe have had a barely perceptible.
Outside of his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong.
A small device as the Fonpeek (it is still curious that it is called Fon while it does not have WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that the operators are starting to think differently and studying various proposals to make their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the downloading of books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and boat.
It is a device connected and pay at the time of purchase, not each month.
And that is what I hope to see a day for the Fonpeek: a purchase option with access to life as peek proposes already in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I simply because I believe that this is a more fair formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The preferred colour of Michelle
Yellow is, without doubt, the preferred colour of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, it has, in effect, chosen the same to accompany him in the second time, without a doubt, the most important of his life: the presentation of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama was a model very similar in these two occasions: in addition to their colour, a yellow drawing towards green with bright, both times, consisted of three parts: the dress, the jacket and mantle, in the same tissue, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a collar.
So a first glance, it would appear that the first lady of the United States to follow the wake of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to deliver the same held.
But the fabric in which are the two sets are very different.
If for the fact that it was a thick, however, it was in Oslo a printed velvet.
The accessories also are different: green shoes to heel average for the first time, and a similar model, but, this time.
The also has changed: The hair are now identified when it was released last time.
75% of working mothers have had problems because of their maternity
discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generation who want to be mothers.
This is the "fertility and women's professional career in Spain, conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9 737 women aged 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their careers because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences concerning the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of job.
Those who do not work outside the home, working part-time or have a less stable, earlier couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with a stable employment, mainly in the public sector, the entry in the life of the couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
The women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being installed in couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable employment needed more time in their lives for it, which led them to reject the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised influence motherhood, but less the start date of common life, explains the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
Education is another factor that is widening the gap in the age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference is also maintains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group aged between 35 and 49 years, those who have elementary and higher were respectively mothers for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another is also among women, according to their level of education.
While those who have done studies marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those with a college or higher this programme and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a prerequisite to marriage and the arrival of a child, "said Mrs Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth
L' Oreal Paris has to add a new name to its list Jalousée ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress embody the image of several products of the mark, the universal currency "because I Vaux.
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses of the international stage, just as well join other celebrities included among L' Oreal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before it, the last to enter the club if select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
Among men, the brand of cosmetics also ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, lessons of Anatomy) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in lost).
The price of the British
The British have much to say in the world of fashion.
Its greatest representatives, creators and mannequins, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual presentation of their price, which took place in London, the Royal Court of Justice.
No one has missed the appointment.
The ex dummy Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected best dummy of the year.
The poker as manual Vincent
Vincent offers us in Poquer of Acso (, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) 30 "X-ray" of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It is not as predictable and apprehended (biographical summary, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the core of the character created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares scares or the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to readings and Relectures.
I leave you here a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the one that I felt without the name: the pleasure against the sad fate, morality without guilt and innocence no God."
On Samuel Beckett: "nihilistic, Christian allegorical, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a poetic humour, meaningless, as the blade of the knife which threatened to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman a passion that lasted 13 years, in the flesh of which the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege which was to reach the sky on the Road to Perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the summits of eight thousand metres of universal literature, it must climb by the north face, on which the best Mountaineers still taken."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange type.
Of himself, he said that he was the son of a landowner in the county and other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.

A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighbourhood of the city, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent away from her and our dog, a Sang-mélé, saved the spa and weighing not more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they Assenèrent two shots which the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is great because we do not see the funny to free a small animal without Defence which, moreover, was on a leash.
Add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking quietly and, when these individuals came to fear for his physical integrity, as a énergumène which attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, a man or, ultimately, anyone smaller than him.
The episode took place at around 5 p.m., Tuesday as another in a usually quiet.
The dog has Gémi throughout the day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the office of the district although we doubt that used to much, and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spaniards.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among the young to find fun to abuse an animal without defence gives us the affection, friendship and we company.
We do not know what has become of the good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among the young, as reported today the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, since it is the only element of protection to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin indicated that the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer "and said it contributed to this objective by other actions to educational and informative.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet on two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be, will include a first phase in which the posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest possible dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is a constant concern "for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products always safer.
Sales of light commercial vehicles
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles starting to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, the dealers.
However, the good news, since the reference for comparison, the month of November 2008, has been particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
Accordingly, despite the last month, registrations accumulated during the 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add up all vehicles in the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pickups, vans, light vans and trucks to lightweight chassis) 95 have been sold.
Large clouds that most affect their calls are not provided, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through an external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved by the limitation of bank credit, must be added other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic conditions.
Faced with this situation and unlike the vehicles, aid for the purchase of the little used.
In addition to the individuals, the self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicles of less than 3.5 tons with a level of emissions of CO2 do not exceed the 160 grams per kilometre, may also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, it recalled again the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers association provides a year 2010 similar to that end, for which it calculates a drop in sales (for passenger cars and 4 x 4) of 19%.
The emergency braking is now mandatory
as has occurred with the anti-lock system of ABS and as it will take place with the ESP stability control, emergency brake assist systems (BAS) will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while in the rest of the vehicles a waiting period was set up at the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in an emergency detected by the system with the kick given by the driver.
But it does not always maintained the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to build on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of its force.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, Revancha, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: It calculates that a disaster on four with casualties would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting on the brakes.
If the driver responds, it means increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision was unavoidable, the device carries the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors postpone until January the plan for Opel
While workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April probably the 8, according to Javier Ortega, the manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, means that every point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and to the governments of the countries where the plants are located, be postponed until early 2010.
In contrast, among GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits be in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group, is increasing in importance.
In the case where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of Porsche Boxster Spyder
to design their last and precious jewel, engineers of Porsche left the Boxster S and have succeeded in nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilograms.
This has led them to happen, first, an automatic roof has been replaced by a roof manual, to reduce 21 kilos, to use aluminium doors as those of the other, 3 kg less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gas tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilograms of earned, climbing Bacquets of sport, still 12 kilograms, and with light 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they have given up the audio system Cdr-30, winning six kilograms and have replaced the Poignéesdes doors by in tissue, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model is also with the box to double clutch, the test was done on a model with manual box of six speeds, mainly on the roads of the secondary network of California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
Its behaviour can only be described as beyond reproach.
The weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time that we had not tested a model as small and light which, at the same time, it guarantees security, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to heat its Musclesà small speed for as long as necessary, until we ask him to sprinter, to recover and grow again its engine ...
This is what we wanted. Through his leadership, as communicative as precise, the car will do what our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Its engine
The sound of its punch, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" or through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The surge capacity is brutal, either or when.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The surface of the roads we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was damaged, but the car has managed the chicken's nests.
The electronic assistants to death here all the way, while on some bends we found in the early morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a car Ultralégère, more entertaining to drive and that is much more than a simple change of the Boxster S.
The car will be for sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 euros.
"Bag girl"

The Vitoria team managed to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a great deal of commitment and collective work, even if it had to wait until the end to win the fight.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets to three points scored, largely the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blue and red, who took the advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team are marked since the perimeter, promises that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the final of the first.
The second was on the same tone, but the team has chosen the game within and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by acclamation and applause to return to his former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to be out as the best player of his team, with 13 points, although the "least six evaluation of splitter already that this night would not be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track to break, nothing was played, far from it, and the team wanted to remind that of Vitoria that you win so easily on their ground, and the hand of Elias, they managed to enter the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellow take the advantage on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed some actions to take to the air, and it is at this point that the gun of Mirza Teletovic which, with three baskets to three consecutive points and the assistance of English and Ribas the meter a reassuring score (54-67), and that the local at the end of the third (57-67).
The team left to play out all the stops in the final period and English and San (60-75) that they were tired person to take away what they had earned during the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini there Eidson, the best of their team, not riel and tried to support it since the three (points).
Despite this, and with splitter removed for misconduct, the players Ivanovic not rushed, defended well, and that the Israelis are reconciled at the last minute (80-85), the party had already played and the victory in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The injury prevented the to do battle
The lost loudly in Greece in the Olympiacos and has given him the head of the Group B of the Euroligue, in a game marked by the absence of the players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team has not been intimidated by the atmosphere of the flag of peace and friendship nor by the magnitude of the rival, without doubt one of the most powerful in Europe with a big budget.
The first game, has the Andalusian. An aggressive defence and three baskets on three consecutive points, two of the ringleader Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio has dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the Arsenal of the local team with the game within Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, has led to reverse the score 22-20, the 13th minute, when an action, an early scuffle, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams has led to the disqualification of two players.

The trying to overcome the absences and the last exit from the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, through his organization, to three points to cook, and to support Lewis, left a little hope with 66-57, at the 31st minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos was when the players were pressure and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.

The Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president will abandon the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d' affaires of the Embassy of Brazil in the capital of Honduras, has confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that it must be based on 27 January, at the end of its mandate, it must seek another destination.
The chain also cited the former agent, who had confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline established: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya said he would remain in the Embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, since Zelaya has refused the status of exiled political intended to impose the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After days roses since last spring, during which the asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty arises there again, which is not surprising since this is their natural state, in an environment where the decisions on a future uncertain by nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing ample liquidity at rates close to zero, so that the financial institutions are buying assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets were virtually finalized and, without calling into question their political maverick liquidity, began to put some sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to a year in the next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without measures and we are now seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of stock markets and business obligations increase again, although they remain very distant from the levels they have reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were obliged to socialize the risk private and public debt is affected again.
There is a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been selected shelters by investors, an increase of differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence defenders of moral hazard, which again trying to provoke a case of conscience in global economic policy that had stalled the destructive effects of the credit limit on the destruction of the employment, while what we should do is declare a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation of Dubai is like a tribal fight between the emirs to restore its place in power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovered the roses.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be totally irrational that the Ecofin saves Hungary a failure to respect its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro area not to respect its commitments.
What is logical is that the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government to transparency and makes its citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as our differences in public debt increase to the extent of the obligations of European companies, Nousn' not have to worry.
If the European and continued to increase, it would be a risk idiosyncratic Spanish.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our predictors most studies to anticipate their models and to revise up their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, who returned to the charge with a Japanese model Spanish economy, it does not bode much hope for their warning.
Again, this appears to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets in Spain, even if for the moment "caution is the mother of safety.
Sectors connected
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the sub-commission of the Congress of Deputies, which is discussed these days Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the president of gas Natural-fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán has outlined for the press that he had spoken to the sub-commission,.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million until 2020 and 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, where the nuclear power plants in operation would remain open.
If that is not the case, the necessary investments not amount to 60 000 million but to 95 000.
By contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be used to increase production capacity, but the distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question is changing, and it will increase the power.
His focuses both on the power plants to gas and coal, with mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18 000 MW more are needed, with other "energy support.
Galán, who believes that the draft law a sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with what his company, did not want to attack the royal decree aimed to encourage the use of coal, which contradicts the policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is "a clear bet in the long term" In this sense, despite the "one-off" measures, as the president of Iberdrola.
In any case, believes that the decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, because they take time before reaching their maturity and that a stable is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the handling of Aer Lingus in ten airports
The Swiss company, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on Earth, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for goods, services in 10 European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, of which the economic terms were not disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol of cooperation to create the innovation centre of intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance provides an investment of 20 million until 2012, 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will conduct research on energy efficiency on highways and at airports.
Acciona dispute its first highway in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first Highway Concession in Australia, the market on which it is already working as a business manager of energy and water.
The project at stake is a tunnel estimated at 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rival.
A 5 - km-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, this is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a business of public works and highways.
The mayor of the city hopes to have by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public / private partnership (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the tutelage of SRS & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May next year, the planned investment amounts to 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, only Spanish company in smooth, and his associates are MDBs and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest manufacturers, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists to work underground.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium northern direct, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian manager of infrastructure and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium which has passed the test is Lbrjv, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of GBA), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian market infrastructure promises of major projects and privatisation, but there is a great difficulty, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that followed the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which is still a step not validated for the Spanish giants of the sector.
GBA is just to win a place on the market by its participation of 30 per cent in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Assets millionaires
A geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its supplier of energy and activity in the sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park, one of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and the consolidation of companies responsible for building and managing the Dessalinisateur of Adelaide, with a budget of $700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter markets in the construction and management of infrastructure.
The road toll underground, promoted by the office of infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and the Northern Link (North), is expected to link Western Toowong the peripheral to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 km tunnel. It is the largest project to reduce the traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will start in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be opened to traffic late 2014, it is not anticipated that the project will be completed by 2016.
The tunnel began to be developed in 2005.
It will include two tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work to Hochtief
Australia continues to be widely Hochtief, who mentioned yesterday obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company held by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the national network infrastructure broadband in fibre.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has given the construction of the tower King George, 27 floors, in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet started and Hochtief concluded the sale to 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC is Adjudiquer a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary, is Adjudiquer the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 km in length for a highway in Slovenia, for an amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The Company has obtained this contract a few days after being given the responsibility of the expansion of the tunnel Bosruck (Austria), for a total of 130 million.
Alpine consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start-up of the site is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will take 32 months.
SRA. Rushmore is Adjudiquer advertising of Renfe
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency SRA. Rushmore, for a budget of around three million euros a year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentioned the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each SRA. Rushmore was chosen from among 16 agencies that have presented to the call for tenders organised by Renfe, of which four have been finalists, who was responsible for creativity in the course of the past three years.

A fine of $63 million to France Telecom to curb competition
The competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region in the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition in the fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and loyalty programs to consumers on the margins of the regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state-run company, accumulating more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles placed its competitors.
The penalty yesterday has been increased because the authority which oversees the competition considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore repeat offender.
A shop applications
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company has followed the wake of other operators and opened a shop of Internet applications, with the objective of increasing revenue from outside the transmission of voice.
Initially, the shop of orange applications will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for that it happens in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League reported 476,4 million to Real Madrid and since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs, since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, the Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have won 467,4 million, which puts them in third and fifth position of clubs who have pocketed the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Win the Champions League of Uefa does not only the glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated 5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the establishment of the tournament, during the 1992-93 season, according to information from Uefa.
The Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have been well served in this distribution.
The club was the third of the continent to receive the most money for his participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, taking the title and last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are the Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams, billed the more money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And this, although they have lost before.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of distribution of money applied by Uefa.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1 090 million through to the Champions League.
Of this amount, Uefa will million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the classification matches (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have managed to participate have received 3.8 million just to be there, more than 550 00 euros for each match.
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who come in eighth final of three million each, the eight teams who reach the final quarter of Reçoivent3,3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win $9 million, the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Well, in the form of fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and a maximum 31.2 million.
On the other hand, has pocketed $2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in Europe in August.
But in addition, there are the variable payments, which are enshrined 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each TV market.

Each day, thousands of vehicles which have suffered a disaster are reduced to a garage, where an expert to assess the damage and the cost of the repair.
Every disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex work.
Calculate the cost of a compensation of between 20 000 and 30 000 euros, including parts and labor could take two or three hours.

Garage in four stages
With the tool Auda-taller, the company Audatex ensures that the user obtains a quotation in only four stages: identify the vehicle, the replacement part, create a quotation and generate.

The database includes 1 034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and trucks.
Of course, to use a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to repair identified through its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question is then selects the necessary.
The user can include variables such as the cost of labour, increases or reductions, then it can print the specifications for the return to the customer.
Audataller is not a tool to estimate as Audaplus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that for garages does not include the time of Labour estimated.
The cost of using this tool in the garage of 350 per year, which may be the subject of a credit.
Currently, the company Audatex works to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
It is an innovation that mechanics are a very good eye, as it will, for example, to select a door and turn to see the inside.
