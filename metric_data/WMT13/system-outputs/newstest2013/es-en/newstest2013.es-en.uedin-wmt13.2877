A Republican strategy to hinder the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified its policy by the need to combat the electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers this a myth and claims that the electoral fraud is less common in the United States that the number of people who die as a result of the fall of lightning.
Indeed, the Republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: These new provisions will affect negatively to the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures would undermine the American democratic system. "
Contrary to what is happening in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
In the same vein, and a majority of American governments promulgated, from 2009, new laws that made the registration process or vote.
This phenomenon has spread after the elections in November 2010, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, during the year 2011 180 bills were introduced that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with a photograph, in addition to a test of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of counting and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present a photo identification.
The State of Indiana was the first to claim it.
The United States Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, the American people do not have a universal identity document, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of the American people, that is to say, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo identification issued by a government agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 without an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity card costs more than a hundred dollars.
Thus, the new restrictions affect disproportionately young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, a 15% of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years does not have a photo ID.
And there are still more.
Students in many states, voters who vote for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo identification document issued by his institution.
On the other hand, those same states allow members of the hunting and fishing clubs who tend to vote Republican parties to use the documents issued by the clubs.
Before 2004, no state demanded proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present such a requirement.
From 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to show that they are American citizens.
These measures are seeking, clearly, limiting the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers supported in 2011 certain laws that abol√≠an registration of voters on the same day of the ballot in eight states.
In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help the voters who wanted to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, the voter registration campaigns contributed to the record of about 10 million people.
The measures taken since 2009 ensured that the rate of registration of new voters to fall in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, a 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter did not represent more than 13% of the voters of the state.
In the case of Hispanics happened exactly the same thing.
These do not represent more than 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing a 76% of the electorate, they do not represent more than 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, the congressional Democrats and their supporters have fervently opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
In this sense, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The public prosecutor of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
Was, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of an identity document with a photograph.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, because it is clear that they intended to influence the outcome of 2012 in key states.
A report by the Brennan Center for 2011 shows that the states that have adopted such laws account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the level of electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: These new provisions will affect negatively to the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures would undermine the American democratic system. "
Prostate cancer screening: Getting the test or not let?
Indeed, the PSA test has, at times, erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it decides to make unnecessary medical interventions.
It is a reason enough to make hesitate to men, already reluctant in itself, whether or not should be screening tests.
Q. Getting the test or not?
We have asked for advice to two specialists.
In the studies carried out in the United States was detected a high rate of infection among the groups of shows, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make recommendations firm.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference of mortality among patients who had made the detection and those who do not.
The study, with a follow-up to 12 years, also showed that exists between 30 and 40% chance of developing metastases if there has been the screening test.
I recommend, therefore, at the age of 50, or from the 40 years if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
The men of African-American origin have a higher risk index.
The key is to take a good decision once detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are nonchalant.
It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. He must provide all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not violate the life in the long term, in which case it must opt instead for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been detected a cancer are not treated, since it is not aggressive cancer or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, they suggest an active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer them a treatment.
We determine increasingly precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you do the test in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not the test should be done.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of the investigations, the adoption of healthy living remain the best way to reduce the risk of suffering the illness.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, it could prevent a 30% of cancers.
"If no one to smoke, that rate would rise at least 50%," underlines Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, we evaluate that around 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked with 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
Greatly harm people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said the spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
An encouraging statistic: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," added.
The food
The agency recommends, equally, limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they climb the risks suffering a colorectal cancer.
Meat products should also be avoided.
Conservation of the meat for its smoked, dried or salted can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"Can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer," he explained.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between the vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, for the moment their research is not conclusive.
The SCC structure, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them was found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what we observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D in the cancer has not been able to determine clearly.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and family history of each with their doctor.
"Do the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs bos√≥n in detail
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bos√≥n likely generated a great shock last summer, and with good reason.
It is believed that this bos√≥n is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted by the standard model: Our best or "less bad" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists is not entirely clear that Higgs concerned.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that looks very much like the Higgs bos√≥n predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week in an important physical congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there are still more data to be completely safe.
Anyway, we assume that this is Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem to be few. We will see what it is.
There are, in this great world, an inescapable widespread law and that means two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and not try too much, because it will end up becoming damage.
Although the particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that it is also an act of these characteristics: The principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists basically of some of its features.
Particles physicists classified into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And on the other are the bosons, dirty a bunch of anarchists who has no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories, which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: The taverns, which we do not here, and the "force particles," for which the great forces of nature are spread and with which the Higgs bos√≥n would somehow related.
These bosons, one would stress here, they are not the exotic creatures that we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this report, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal bos√≥n: The photon particle or "light" that acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or change of direction, "mess up" the electromagnetic field at that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon; that is to say, one of the bosons "force carriers."
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs bos√≥n, with the difference that this is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "messy" for this bos√≥n appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it needs to arrive at extremely high energies, a little as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slip through the surface.
That is why we need a huge particle accelerator at the CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 kilometers in circumference!) to reach such levels of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
Indeed, not all particles and all the materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the magnets, they do, but others do not: A piece of paper, for example, will not by itself never stuck to the door of a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), do not have it.
But what "may provide" all these investigations?, asks the Lady Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and allows, moreover, that physicists escrutinen differences between the observations and predictions of the MS.
For their part, many wish fervently that are, for the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that tape certain holes of the model.
This, it must be said, is still huge shortcomings, such as that does not propose any explanation regarding the seriousness (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of matter in the Universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
-impact
The impact of these investigations in our day-to-day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that will not have any.
To see: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in laboratories suspected not at all the revolution that its work force.
Entreve√≠an scientific applications, but nothing more.
Indeed, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and that produced the first continuous laser (the first was down) in 1962, initially the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus."
Just imagine...
And in addition, applications can also come from the entire instrumentation surrounding the investigation.
For example, the same Willard Boyle drew up a light sensor in 1969 in the course of his research in the field of optics.
Despite the fact that it was not at all its original intention, this probe now serves "eye" for all the world's digital devices, which earned him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
That is not to say, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir
The Commission on Dignity in Dying, Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate should be joined again soon as they prepare a bill.
However, within that domain essential, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to see it closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment the Mont√©r√©gie.
Prostate cancer that was destroying had given him a two-year respite.
"I had been given five years of life, but now I have just seven," recounts, made a pass, lying on his bed in the center of palliative care Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, who arrived the previous day.
"But it is always a shock, we cannot be prepared for this," continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc: A huge weakness that prevents him from going only to the bathroom and even eat alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, resigned accepts that help you eat.
Courageous, comes even to smile, to talk to the strangers who will devote attention, we bring medicines and provide a bathroom.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I cure diarrhea, it is humiliating," he confesses.
A few hours later, the team found remedy to this evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man does pee standing," recounts Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the center Victor-Gadbois.
Back to his childhood, for some people, it is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the ability of the person to accept this regression," notes.
Because, in the view of the majority of the people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the heart of this regression.
All patients who come into the center of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative care."
The biggest fear of Mrs A., 89 years, is dying "conscious and drowned out."
But the disease has made him to discover their children.
"I have some good children," he adds.
"I no longer have more wishes in this life," he says, before accepting that he put a mask to help her breathe.
And, in the next few days, a last visit to his son, who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps food.
They are palliative care that give them when you can't do anything more.
In order to help his death be more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have a bed of palliative care for every 700 inhabitants.
It is very little, because we know that all we will end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
Whether at the level of comfort physical, emotional or spiritual.
He was dying to offer mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, according to the demand.
For diabetics are no longer controls its rate of sugar.
The death is part of the everyday.
Last night we serve a beer to Mr X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son was completed beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," recounts Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever be equal.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savor his last family reunion in the courtyard, well-placed among their pillows while all drink to your health, a 36-year-old girl dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there are always three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years ill from cancer," worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
A 53% of patients who are admitted to the center Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes from his home and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, to the care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient arrives at the terminal phase of his life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care facility.
And several agencies, such as the center Victor-Gadbois and society of palliative care at home of the Grand Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer.
It is precisely this great relative shortage in health care of Quebec what makes many doctors who specialize in palliative care fear the adoption of a law to regulate euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not competent enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before they agree to proceed with euthanasia.
"Recently," recounts, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in Emergency suffering great pain without has done what is necessary to alleviate it.
I fear that patients want to die alone because they do not receive appropriate care. "
And at the same time, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.
The hopes of survival of H√©l√®ne Richard were already low when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my onc√≥loga that he wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sad that I would like to stop fighting," recounts.
"However, she had told me that there was nothing more to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients seeking to die are grateful for their carers who do not have attended in its demands once they have been relieved their pain, thanks to a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful with regard to the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home in Grand Montreal, patients do not respond to treatment against the pain in an 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, whether from a casual or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the disease is not relieved will have the opportunity to have that palliative sedation.
The patients who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want to euthanasia," but "I want to relieve me."
The realization of this report has been made possible by a grant of journalism research institutes of health of Canada.
Real estate scandals large-scale in Quebec
Officials from the road network, entrepreneurs from the BTP, fundraisers of political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia count, day after day, what they know a formidable "system," which includes the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and gangsters.
"Industry" that went too expensive to the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in the 1990 "s and 2000.
"It is curious how the system is sprayed once we have hunted to big media," satirises Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into the embezzlement linked to road contracts in Quebec, the Liberal prime minister at the time, Jean Charest, had not allowed more than delay.
The report "Duchesneau" established a direct link between the industry, the illegal financing of parties and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved $1 billion in contracts," containing some of his instincts to stay with a proportional part.
The Commission has already done "Charbonneau fall to two mayors," he adds, while it hopes to reach "demonstrate the existing ploys behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The anti-corruption permanent Unit, created in 2011, also applies to his team of auditors, investigators and analysts from the government.
This unit operates in addition to the police officers of the "Marteau," which, since 2009, have made the "cartel of sewage Montreal" moderate to inflate contracts.
These past few weeks, the unit has proceeded to record in series of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resign from his post of mayor of Laval, Quebec City third.
It is suspected that has been repeated pocketed bribes in exchange for public contracts.
It has been formally charged to the road network engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and furthermore Lino.
The latter has caused shock to explain to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He paid for three years a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia that transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor G√©rald Tremblay.
Furthermore, M. distributed money left, right and centre during the years 2000, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power.
He admitted, too, have organized an illegal fundraising for the liberal ex-deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation in the cost of the contracts sewage
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles surprenant, exingeniero of public works, he explained very well before the committee: In ten years received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of $736.000, all in exchange for sewage contracts whose inflated costs.
Other officials of the road network have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30% and 40% in false concept extras.
In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay had deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled their coffers of dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led to Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected policies Montreal that made sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivi√®re-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, since 2010 objected to the sale of municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold by 1.6 million to the promoters in the real estate boom.
70% of the money from the electoral campaigns was dirty money
The investigation that eventually will be carried out, it ensures that pulls "by a thread in order to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits."
He added that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are cleaning the wounds but would need a fair investigation unit in Montreal and be very alert to the dubious practices are not repeated.
How do the cleaning.
He regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, declares that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but it is restless especially for the role of the '"elected politicians aware of the ploy."
Estimating 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, observes: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The government has proposed limiting Tsao to $100 donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as long as it is not strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics."
It recommends a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: "We cannot fall below; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a more solid basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who are laughing all to look in the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would explain this progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also for the new dimension of PSG.
Have come big players.
I advance from day to day at his side.
The technical staff also has brought me a lot.
These elements and push me on a daily basis to raise the level of my game.
In a party, that is easier.
Everything is going very quickly in football.
But I am not acaloro.
Since my start in the centre of preformaci√≥n INF of Clairefontaine until my step by Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by leaps and bounds.
It is going to get the benefit of competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
The recruited this summer are used to play games of very high level.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player as I would like to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
It is backed up by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I.
But Ancelotti is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all the technicians.
Today, there is no one like in the League 1 and is among the best European coaches.
It has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think it will take other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a conversation with him very comforting.
I had just emerged from a series of injuries.
The confidence they have in me also explains my good performance.
What does he think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In the League 1, Lyon has taken the post of leader.
But we are still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: We have qualified for the quarterfinals with style.
What is the purpose of the club in this competition?
We are going to try to go as far as possible.
From now on, you can spend anything.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, for a start, finishing the first of our league against Porto in order to receive the return of quarterfinals.
Does the PSG can become a major European club in the short term?
Already has the budget...
In order to become a major European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is handed over to their means for this project is carried out.
Not to win the cup in the League 1, as in the last season, would be a huge failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts on bringing us that title of champions.
In the last season we not far away.
In May, we were a disappointment, because we had the optimum conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We end up with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a better season.
This year, I think it will be a good thing.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I believe that we have the weapons to llev√°rnoslo.
Do you think that the media are more than PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot from us if we think of what has been invested in the players that we have.
We have accepted.
After that we win 4-0 at home to Troyes, who still find themselves with things that criticise is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else expected people.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
Don't we are the FC Barcelona!
We try to put in place a project of game.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Talk to Manchester City that, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for the quarterfinals, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, os imaginar√≠amos with 15 point advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our adversaries and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May, we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up leading the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better to say that we have a "Zlatandependencia."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that puts many goals.
He has come to demonstrate that it is the star of the League 1.
And it has shown in all the teams for which has been that he is a great player, a global star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men who has around them.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to see progress.
How you've lived Euro 2012 with the team of France?
It has been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me accumulate play time.
I saw things there and I left strengthened.
Today's achievement to play good matches in the selection.
This is what I expected from my baptism with the "blue."
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is why we now have an exemplary behaviour.
What you have vision of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the front of the "blue"?
Is getting results.
They are well-placed in the group qualification for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case of Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved its goal of mechanics for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps leads to the selection to Brazil.
Does the tie (1-1) 16 October in Spain served to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Each fought for all.
Before the shock in Spain, had not experienced a game like that in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the contrary to the current monetary exchanges, based on the central banks, the transactions identified and processing charges between the parties.
In addition, as often happens in the technologies, the political vision is palpable: The belief that the current monetary system, composed of bank monopolies, leads to the financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible into dollars, euros, etc., and an insurance exchange protocol to the way BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files on an equal footing.
There have been nearly 200,000 transactions thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And nearly a thousand websites accept bitcoins as the donations or as a form of payment.
The value of the bitcoin, having reached the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to haunt the ten dollars (contributions are censan on page bitcoincharts.com).
There is nothing impressive if we compare it with the global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) are interested in him in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
In it, he described the bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "which is competing with the dollar or the euro," and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as the "credits," used to move forward in a video game and you can win by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeem).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But a central authority in any exchange controls and about the changes.
With bitcoin, all the network nodes are both repositories of accounting books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two addresses in the form of e-mail.
A user can choose a different direction for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signing electronically through a system of double-encryption key.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins entered in the book of public accounts, which spreads across the network.
The key milestone is to write this new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add that line complementary.
This is a phase of cubed file, i.e., transforming a large file in a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "chop" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning).
Once found that number, the other nodes easily verified that is a good thing.
The transaction is then indestructiblemente linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the mark.
If, for committing a fraud, a user would pay twice for the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network will accept as valid only one of the two transactions; the other would be left an orphan, since both have different tracks.
The computer that will solve the challenge is 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, the reward is divided into two regularly, with likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until cienmillon√©simo, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also reveals in every increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
The Web sites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and robbed bitcoins on deposit.
"The ruling does not affect the same protocol used," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of blanquo money thanks to this anonymous service.
But the cash presents the same defect.
The actors of weight as Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, such as the platform Wordpress, the accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Weizmann Insitito in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins does not circulate.
In November it launched the "giant cuts."
"It changed $30,000," revels Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts the bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a book on that currency pedagogical, believes enough in the potential of this technology in addition to online transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, amounts to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but Bitcoin used to validate transactions, so are cheaper.
The carrier, moreover, manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to put in place in the shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They simply provide a direction that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, which claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement review hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin impose, but in 2013 there could be a change," predicts.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB plans to revalue the various risks, today considered high, in the event that this successful currency.
We have out of Afghanistan.
What happens next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army retake possession of its territory and that Afghans choose their own future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished mainly to Afghan farmers, who have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of foreign army, as in the times of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes unite jihadis, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they are no longer when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I watched from the top of the hills of almond trees planted by French credits, was made on the orders.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, monitored by the helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since his irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then vacuum and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
It took control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghans have paid the price of obscurantism his peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The leading figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, gaining government land for resale as plots for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from a pair of huge US outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; most of them do not have fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspires to a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will be those who have managed to take advantage of American generosity: Capital flight is considerable.
The young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived through the modern world during its exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With around 65% of its population under 25 years, Kabul has now with 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
We will have to give work to those young people who do not want to go back to the dark ages of the old parties or corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones. The television and chapbooks Turks with a modern world has great admirers around the country.
The army is now present.
Is it considered legitimate authorities who want to lead the country?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle to reconstitute already worry provincial militias, will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a degree of decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States would have wanted to transform into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly during the elections scheduled in April 2014.
However, his country depends on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has restored its services, has not been fixed nor any reservoir have been repaired irrigation systems.
Everything is imported and is not produce anything except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, it would have been necessary to government control.
Spread the rumor that Afghanistan had huge mining riches.
And that only added to the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract the copper or iron ore from the ground and without means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese already have left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excaven the immense site b√∫dico and remain there as the major employers in the province.
It will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country which largely depend on imports and exports, restore their normal relations.
The French troops departed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: Girls' schools, colleges of children, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the fields of military, legal, health and agricultural and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "win the hearts and minds" and make the impossible task of making the aid and offensive actions match, a service of "civilian and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (CIMIC), abolished in 2012, and he did bring brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, greedy for local labour force, have been able to help contain the insurrection: Irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased crop surfaces.
What we will leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, very tough in these valleys located often over 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
For the release of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me that they want, would be required to maintain a small civilian aid, well controlled and they come directly.
A constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally granted full powers, he decided to play everything.
Caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote their final text the following day.
Only a week ago, the head of state had given two months to the Assembly to finish their work.
And nearly two years ago that Egypt uses a provisional text, amended several times, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements.
This new initiative has not done more to increase the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president is persisting in his "autocratic delirium" and "betraying its word continues" and "trampling on the right."
On the part of his supporters, ensures that this is a measure to end faster with the institutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
In the next 15 days should organize a referendum.
A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to renounce its project to explain the text, article by article, the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversial wreaks havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in its favour, as stated in an interview with the US weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, contains an ultimatum to the Egyptian people, "or vote my text or maintain full powers," powers that supposedly will come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, Islamist overwhelmingly, the text voted yesterday.
Most of the liberals did not go to the call.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because they felt that they could not assert their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the quorum necessary, yesterday morning was added to 11 people, members substitutes, in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles have been unanimously voted.
Commentators makes them grace, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has expressed virtually in prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to believe that the Constituent clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, subject to all eyes, remains finally identical to that of the constitution of 1971, which stipulated that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped to be able to replace "principles" for "the rules," which would have allowed a stricter application.
For the Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of its goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals accused him of hypocrisy and feel that it is not just an advertising trick.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
Relate, in particular, Article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University, a consultative role, particularly for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is troubling because "people called to rule is not elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy. "
The fears of liberals are also increased by the fact that the next chancellor of the university would be considerably less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is not a specific religious involvement.
With this Constitution are within the framework of the marital status.
Most of the lawyers who have been working on this text are not scholars but university students, some of them trained in the French system, "says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity surrounding the article 220, because the terms employed imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We mean specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the competent civilian judges to rule above all this. "
Beyond their religious character, the text voted yesterday has received much criticism that relate to the extended powers that gives the president of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will argue that there are few compared with those who were during the previous regime.
Another sticking point: The powers granted to the military.
According to the desire of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be subject to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will be banned prosecutions of civilians in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
These also showed their concerns relating to the text, which they consider liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, the insults are banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially in the press.
In addition, any article emphasizes the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with Article 36.
The word did not appear in the Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president should leave last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of State demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, the Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comforts and a pristine nature.
"IDA" identified the five most important reasons for which is due to visit Israel.
In the Holy Land reverence
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enter into this "baptismal font" will receive the divine grace.
And the Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: The conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walk on the water, appeasement of the storm and full networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest number of holy places in Jerusalem.
The believers travel here the Cross will or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, Pretorio, where the trial was held, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre in Mount Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion, Piedra de la Unci√≥n and the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the world's symbolic Christian Navel, symbolizing the salvation of humanity.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the spot where, according to a legend Christian, there was a tree that became the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest site for Jews, the Wailing Wall; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 AD.
As is tradition, people from different religions leaves here notes with their wishes, which then will become a reality.
A vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada fortress was what was a secret shelter against the enemies, that Herod the Great built in the year 25 BC for his family.
Found in the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, they can only those who will be dedicated to the escalation.
The others can reach this historic summit in the cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 metres is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
There, from the foot of the hill bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, at the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit museums only
In this country there are about 300 museums.
In a single trip you can't visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It will retain the ancient Dead Sea scrolls or 42 of Qumran, discovered in caves in the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.

The fifth, the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in the concentration camps and the gas chambers.
You get into it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they were killed.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health care
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, museums and oceanographic delfinarios.
It is curious that in the Red Sea a kilometre even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not lower the 21 degrees and the air is heated up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even more warm and bathe there throughout the year.
Indeed, this sea, the most remarkable in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily argue to those who do not know how to swim.
The landscape of the surroundings are truly beautiful.
People come here to spend courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing mud and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put in order its broken nerves.
Touching the mysteries of the
The retains the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It was the famous maritime route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Egyptian and Greek legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built the ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in the same place, took a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets bearing the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you tap on the walls in the streets of your "same" symbol, you will be good fortune.
Can be found in Jaffa newly married couples people realized that come from all parts of Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Jerusalem, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "take" the strength of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Remember tourists
If he travels to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: In this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not advisable to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to sh√©quels (currently $1-3, 8 sh√©quels).
Urban transport consists mainly buses, but there are fast tram in Jerusalem and Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six seasons and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
Travel in any kind of public transport costs 6 sh√©quels and for that price, you can travel doing transshipment during 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, on Saturday celebrated Shabash.
Since the night of Friday to sunset Saturday, markets and shops closed and public transport stopped their work.
But on Sunday morning starts a new working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels are only kosher, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that combine milk and meat.
It offers a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a great variety of sauces, fal√°fel, which are ground chickpea balls, fruits and vegetables.

Israel in figures

Most of those who came to tour the country and the rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, UK and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds in 51% at the same rate of the year 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime powered on 9 February 2011.
"The big and powerful" will take you to Moscow: Immigrants save for language
While deputies and human rights advocates argue about the consequences that would bring the law on compulsory examination, have already appeared in the country scamming trading with certificates "false"
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
His only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December enters into force a law, according to which each immigrant labour should make an examination to test their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who have the intention to work in the service sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the tests will be made mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to pay the examination of the language, but also the Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language should confirm even to receive and to renew the work permit.
Are the exception citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
They will not be subject to this law people who managed to get their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, doom and defending the rights
The network of centres examiners will work sponsored by the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be presented to the evidence in all cities, now in Russia are open more than 160 centres of this kind.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But the defenders of the rights, long before the law came into force, they often do this question to the press: And what will bring this into reality?
What changes will bring the obligation of knowledge of the language, both for the Russians and immigrants themselves?
First, they respond the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "slave labour."
A lot of people talk today about defending the rights of immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the Federal Immigration Service's representation of Russia in Tajikistan.
The defense of their rights must begin before his departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in a 90% of the cases.
The problems are immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical supervision.
Without an understanding of the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be sentenced to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, "a lot my paid" a shocking and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In his homeland promised one thing, but when you get are deceived, are deprived of their passports, wages are not paid promised," confirms the head of the Directorate of Immigration Service labour immigration from Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be angry, jefecito!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country where they want to go, but also in their own language written with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much his fault but his own misfortune: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention clothe them already, calzarlos and buy what is necessary for the school.
To reach adolescence, these guys venturing to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if we do not know the language, recognize them.
"You feel humiliated and bottom."
However, in terms of the law on language, the defenders of the rights point to an important point.
The tests will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no review and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers were still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or prohibited the passage to strangers."
Many visitors say they receive the official status in our country is not so easy.
The case is in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, the legalization costs money: Twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be done quickly and for only thousand five hundred rubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that usually carry false documents, we are not registered and appear cases of extortion.
"We are asking for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," commented to reporters the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.
"We are going, don't be stingy, buys a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it became clear that not only the registration documents for immigrants may be false.
A number of "false certificates" knowledge of the language has already been seized by officials from the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed in standard color printers.
Of course, arrived at the hands of the new owners not as a gift: Every immigrant, who wanted to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official review procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that the "qualifications" is not to buy, converge government officials and advocates for the rights.
So far, the authorities can promise to migrant workers who had not been able to successfully pass the test the first time more time to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with the people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with guns registered is quite small
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: Tighten shots during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no casualties, and the massacre started by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogr√°dov, which tighten seven people lost their lives.
The police wants to ban the use and possession of weapons traumatic in public places and raise the minimum age for handgun license, 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the law on weapons possession will be carried to the State Duma in the near future.
Not all are happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "heavy-handed policy."
The network has appeared in an open letter, whose authors, representatives from various social organizations of handles, demand that it abandon such measures "senseless stringency."
The percentage of acts of vandalism with use of weapons registered is minimal, said to the BBC news service from Russia, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy L√©snikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, for six months of the year 2012 142 crimes were committed with use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared to the total 1168 recorded crime for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the field of weapons for civilian use will not be a problem for which the offender heading to the black market.
Now, in his words, in Moscow can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, in the Ministry of Interior says that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From factories to official
The black market of weapons is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says the retired Col. Viktor Baranets, who for 10 years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the web site that accepts orders for weapons
The first, "vestige of the military or army," that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officials and by the same Caucasians," said Baranets.
This kind of "black weapon," the stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that here include weapons stolen from the warehouses of the police and those stolen directly by officials from the law enforcement organs.
Illegal weapons go on sale from the military arsenals.
In many military arsenals often had explosions.
"There are versions demonstrated that some of the fires were caused deliberately to cover the lack," says a exmilitar.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their bit.
"Now private factories have proliferated weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
A further source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There have their own production, sometimes craftsmanship, and has formed a mafia that has organized the flow of arms," explains the former military.
Where are the weapons?
Experts have calculated what is the participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for analysis and planning problems of governance.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and RosStat, literature and criminological data public access portals whose theme revolves around the weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the weapons of the black market has arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to the weapons," it says in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases were stolen during the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to the "illegal archaeology."
The dependent on one of the stores of weapons, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal diggers not purchase anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers are directed at military stores when they need a game.
Through a major step, the provider buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
The removed from the register and pass above the fence.
"It takes the weapon to the city and sold to 900 euros per unit with two chargers," tells us
"But, of course, the police is aware of all the issues, so regularly, when you have to comply with the plan of discovery of offences, try to make purchases from merchants of illegal weapons," adds the dependent.
"As in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually be found through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a type that I proposed that would the platform" Begovaya, "where he would be a man that I would lead to a" esquinita "where we could negotiate.
The price of the weapon, I learned only there. "
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the shop assistant. "I have a friend like that, but not much trust in him."
In the markets there are sellers, but there are also has to come, say "on the part of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked to tell him that he had fallen a tooth her daughter."
I can even get a pair of brass knuckles steel through a trusted person.
He also provides the only to me because he knows that I am not going to week.
Novices are searching for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets was put to the test in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, in his words, have not changed.
He was issued a photo album where there was no "all."
"I felt like a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to the words of Baranets, does not offer a pig in a poke: Everything can be proven.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we are going with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"Give me the opportunity to shoot and when I can assure you that the weapon fired well, we began to negotiate," describes the procedure the expert.
Store of sofas
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte," which offers to buy weapons "for different purposes."
For this is not require any document or personal encounters.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advert "Buy a pistol or a machine gun."
There, users make their orders and put questions.
What they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"I buy TT pistol. Moscow," tersely makes his question "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handed catch to those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, as hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
Military commentator Viktor Baranets exmilitar and
I have heard of these systems: Generally, the website is registered outside the reach of Russian laws.
People the orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, he sent a photo and instructions for who knows where it is hiding the weapon," recounts the press secretary of the NGO "The right to arms," Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets says that if you place an order online, one is left without a weapon and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handed catch to those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, as hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
For $100 Makarov
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to the experts, you can spend $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The right to weapons," a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
It will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses for middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared with the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia fell by 7%, which is 22,900, and the number of cases identified robbery and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8%.
Employees are on strike of fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the US.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as a cashier at McDonald's. "
In recent days, the United States has launched a wave of protests against low wages paid in supermarkets in the Walmart corporation and restaurants in the popular fast food chains, such as McDonald's, Burger King, "" Taco Bell, "" Wendy's "and" Kentucky Fried Chicken. "
For now, no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will come to the nine points, or if he is destined to lose strength and amansarse in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by the unions and a number of left-wing NGO.
In addition to the increase in the modest salaries earned by employees of Walmart and the fast-food system, the objective of the organizers of the protests is the creation of unions of workers in these enterprises.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Do Forty-six cents a year?
The shares began last week, the day after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States coomenzaba orgy of cuts that captured million inhabitants, and that sometimes was accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers from the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and picketed to protest alongside the trade unions and left-wing activists in the shops of the corporation, whose products are aimed at people with modest incomes and moderates.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than the larger supermarkets.
That is why many underpaid workers from Walmart buy only at work.
The availability and assortment of products made from Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the words two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at a very low price, in part because it pays little to their workers.
They also complain of bad working conditions, such as the lack of lift or hand-held scanners.
The "Black Friday" the participants in the rally demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation spent $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical worker Walmart, which receives 9.5 dollars per hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now.
If Walmart puts wage increases on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend a ridiculous amount of $has more than they spend now.
Walmart's supporters say satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" lasted in its stores from 8 Thursday afternoon until midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers made the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post Web site, who left his job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than 'a public relations stunt, "organized by the union workers.
"Fund free!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely the Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not have appreciation, and so for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
But McDonald's says it sells billions of pieces, and even then you give the sick leave and don't pay for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, in accordance with federal law and New York, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
The fast-food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and the average, ordinary workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour.
No one wins less than them in this city.
How is it possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers passed by the McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although still lived with his parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there a long time.
Now, constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal magazine there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he doesn't know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 Thursday morning in the McDonald's of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and fast-food cooks are starting to pay at least $15 per hour, or that they double its current minimum wage.
They also demanded that the fast food industry is believe workers' unions.
The US law prohibits the administration to prevent them from this right and punish the activists of the trade union movement with skulduggery and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy to cover the food sector unions ra.
One of the main is the excessive staff turnover.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place on the same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally in the McDonald's located near Times Square, attended by several local Democratic politicians, particularly the City Council member Jumaane Williams of the city, who said: "McDonald's says it is selling billions of pieces, and then even gives you a hospital or you pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators have received support from other prominent Democrats from New York, for example of the candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support the fast-food sector workers to achieve receive fair wages and economic prosperity that deserves every New York."
As described by the New York Times newspaper, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in the history of the American fast food.
But she took part only a few hundred people, even if not all of them were employees of the fast-food service, in which trabakan tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a mass movement.
"For now, fool the brain is not so easy."
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, lately is perceived as normal primarily through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, in its annual conference Google showed a model on the move and later, in November, it emerged that Microsoft had also submitted a request to reclaim the relevant patent.
However, in a conversation with the head of the group of 3D interactive technology in Microsoft's lab in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, determined that for scientists from that company, glasses already belonged to a bygone era.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and the creation of virtual spaces open.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of his research group?
- We are dedicated to the interaction between man and computer, but in addition we try to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
For now, humanity in his great mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the pixels on the screen TVs, sometimes plays the finger.
But we want to look at 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today is sold without any Xbox Kinect, because all they are interested in control by gestures.
- What more what the future holds?
- Despite Kinect interaction has led to the physical level, much of it still happens in a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work in three-dimensional visualization systems truly, based on different technologies, including the design.
We must rid the world of information technology to ours, the physicist, making it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only to the user, but also the space that surrounds it.
Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable.
Firstly, the devil with those stupid virtual reality helmets.
- What do you think about the control by voice?
A very popular detail, but do not believe that exaggerate?
- Of course he cannot be seen as a panacea, remains to resolve the issue of privacy, since they are not always want others to learn about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think of gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that was the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, overall, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how I would ask you to spend this can of soda?
You will speak and show at the same time.
- Normally I only speak.
- Oh, this is going to be very difficult to recognize.
- Or is, you want to force users to adapt to what may or may not do at the moment the machine?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I believe that in the near future we are going to have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can determine precisely the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what you have complaints from the modern cameras?
Would you lack resolution, depth or something more?
- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 Megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the issue is not on the cards, but on the quality of the matrix and in depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; that gives more work to the designers of algorithms.
In other words, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
It is also important to the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for the gestures.
Steven Bathiche, our lab in Redmond, made an adjustable touch sensor processing lag from 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects the human-machine interaction.
I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact for the frames per second more.
- And it is not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "" cameras, one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the recipient of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple pitch visible sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, the number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the amount required calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analogous Kinect, playing with the curvature of location of the cameras and see how this would help determinr the three-dimensional position.
- For what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public.
Do you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spend all the while holding high a smartphone in the hands, it is not very comfortable, but I think: The best option would be an augmented reality "transmutable" when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could spend the glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are very personal devices, that is its strength (private things you can only see them), but also its weakness: An augmented reality based on glasses will not work on virtual objects along with other people.
- let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man," but also for any mere mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point to: There is no tactile response.
The hands do not feel anything!
What answers prepares his group to this challenge?
- In my conferences often say that augmented reality is the seventh appearance in the interaction between man and machine.
I believe that the eighth could well be adding tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second-hand as support for the image.
Sign-Up for touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at providing tangibilidad these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic beams aimed at a specific point where the finger feels similar to that one feels if someone was sopl√°ndole at their fingertips, but this feeling is still very weak.
There are also bracelets for the doll that affect the nervous terminations of fingers, this also a promising direction.
- have you tried to fool the brain?
Do you think he feels what it seems that should feel at the moment that you see something?
- That is a good idea, we have not yet tried.
Here is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space that will create an open space, almost without end. We are also working on the idea of the treadmills (not like gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons.
For now, fool the brain is not so easy, there is still to work for many years.
That is what makes it attractive work with virtual reality for researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Personal taste subjective instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "avant-garde of St. Petersburg," dedicated to the citizens who are in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city: Often find recognition in Europe without Russia knows even.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, which can be found near the Russian Museum, close to the Summer Garden or in meetings of fashion and inaugurations.
The paintings of Kirill Miller always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those young purely sociofil√≥sofos of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-garde of St. Petersburg in the late 1980s - the early 1990s.
In addition, it is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city wakes up in the inhabitants smiles and lifts all the mood.
Recently, he took in his hands a organillo and became the recording of St. Petersburg, as it has matured to do so difficult role, for its bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
 - Kirill, why are you going through the city's red dress and not turquoise or yellow, for example?
- Choose the red because I am a fashion designer and I devote myself to the appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray raises aggressiveness and agitation of properties nothing good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions are an invitation to the debate.
 - When comprendiste destinations being an artist?
 - In an exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevsky, where they displayed my work.
I realized that this was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free, like me, were still incomprendidos.
I made friends with artists from the new wave, with the subsequent to those faced in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10," and it is over the new wave.
I Sunni minorities in the theater for clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the letters.
 - And all this stuck in your art Clinic... - For me it was important to be on the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where they were supposed to gather the best creative minds.
In 1995, I became a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there was no reforms, there was a musical art club, a bohemian club, the house of bohemia of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought to the project to "The Van Gogh's ear."
Schnur and his friends sang songs light under phonogram, were wearing tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began playing live, became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training the received from us.
Gallery "D 137," the "Griboedov's Club, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was "The people of our city."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected I, thus ended my culmination.
In these new times is not convenient to work; I'm a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to be popular, but the culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
 - There is in your work something recognizable.
 - Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly expressed today and the occurrence.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns."
The clowns are a timeless category.
I was sociable before, but now be so is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns are all embadurna and the tragedy is removed.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a compulsory totalitarian and change clothes.
Now one follow him for clothes, driven on the outside, but not inside the person.
And, perhaps that person should not be or give a hand, but spit on him in the face.
And deception will be removed when they change clothes.
 - A little you saw in the role of urban recording. - A cultured city must have a hero as well.
Who better than I am to be!
 - Well, but the best commercial art can be beautiful?
 - Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people are grouped together in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the other simplones.
Now all have been divided into microcomunidades, it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not a ticket a hundred dollars to wish them all.
Now we need to think about who you want to taste.
Now, every hero worship has its 100 fans.
 - and to listen to these Mikhailov arrive by thousands!
 - Van to see the abandoned, there is the sex-social sphere.
And a cultural event going 300 people, 10 thousand will never. As a result, less management, less money, everything is fading.
I have to my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not spoil what you have achieved.
When I was young I did such a collector had the paintings hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually ends.
Now often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money only to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
 - Kirill, what is it that is missing in St. Petersburg?
 - Buenos experts in culture.
There is a concept: Official of culture.
But not all of them can engage in the culture.
When the Kings were the correct all was another way, the Kings might not understood very well the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the correct experts.
In Moscow, there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg that could well be experts, but are closed, because we need experts to a higher level to evaluate correctly to them and open way.
It is now thriving the subjective personal taste.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all the modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
 - What is for you St. Petersburg?
 - St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow, there is far more culture, there is ground.
But on our stones is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and we now have more writers that readers, this is wrong.
In Europe, there are a lot of people with curiosity that is going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We need to make art is out of fashion, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be run with a grant of St. Petersburg.
To give birth in
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or clash with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with humans aboard leave in search of a planet parts.
In order to preserve mankind becomes the main question: How to continue the species in weightlessness or on the same planet parts?
I believe that there is little choice.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head of the State Astronomical Institute researcher, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora.
Half a century ago that were carried out experiments with plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit but not in anything terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the dros√≥filas.
In 1979, were sent into space quail eggs to see how it develops the embryo in weightlessness.
We get as a result a normal chick.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, must stand on its own feet and start to move," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
By failing to find support, the chicks were randomly Acer.
And after 10 hours in newborns was given a total atrophy instincts.
The chicks not reacted to light and sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days are simply died.
"And we managed twice born chicks, but then we stopped because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a "biological" miniarca flew to the orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.
However, in the "biosat√©lite Bion" only will travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space, already fetuses.
In principle, it is not found nothing supernatural.
"This was precisely the biosat√©lites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, it has not yet managed to deal with the problem of reproduction directly into space.
It is a difficult challenge.
The animals, to lose their usual habitat, simply cannot carry out their sexual instinct.
The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, it can.
Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is capable of creating a proper emotional fund.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women travel into space for 50 years ago.
The greatest risk is spent Tereshkova.
And what is most precious of humanity is the female body.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: If you are after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has responded to this question," says the veteran aerospace Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the girl, Andrian Nicolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, are numbered astronauts who after long flights have all been well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," summarizes the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, Russia's hero, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The Center's hidrolaboratorio preparation of cosmonauts is a compulsory stage in the preparation for the flight.
In terms of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their skills to work in space.
The water simulates the weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child is his native element.
The small amphibious-men seem to confirm that life on earth emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, because then it will be easier to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath spend only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, monitor swimming of newborns.
In short, if the weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women is necessary the gravitation, the force of gravity.
In the weightlessness abdominal muscles and the pelvis decrepitan is very fast, the ability of expulsion of the fetus is reduced.
Well, we drop it, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it pulls.
"And then what?," Valeri Polyakov becomes this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of gravity, the body does not produce the skeleton nor the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit she is impossible with a special dress for training, as adults.
Simply he is without what is vital for him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to bring to the Earth to a disabled person, a person entirely from afar," provides for the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time, this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships come to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in space.
Chief NK√ö: The inspection of the system "≈°varc" has not given with the politician guilty
In the area of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application limp.
Says Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office (NK√ö) in an interview for Aktu√°lnƒõ.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we need," thus describes the current situation.
Joint controls of the inspectors Czechs and Germans also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of a practice incorrect, mentions the attitude of Petr Neƒças towards the system to be autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "≈°varc system."
 The prime minister said recently that the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would not harass businessmen with inspectors. Then, is banned or permitted?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks or require obligations," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the committee of control in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the Czech and German team, in the framework of which compared the legislation concerning the public contracts in both countries.
What exactly is?
It is a parallel control that we began to make some two years ago.
Such a simple: European law regulates how they should organize the public contracts, this is followed by the current legislation in each country and, later, the practice itself.
We have united all and, although the control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more complete," however, concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
Confirms, then, that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but it is necessary to concentrate on the implementation of the law itself.
What can bring in fact this project? What he believes are the conclusions?
It is a common control of this kind could help that we stop investing efforts in the realization of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, although this does not have a very positive impact.
The economy of saving means to achieve an appropriate thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) in order to avoid the enrichment and, in the long run, the criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of the awards mean that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with both "red tape," that those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do it more easily than if the limits remain as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the pr√°cticaa of public contracts.
How does the system of checks in Germany?
Is it a similar to our NK√ö or is organized differently?
On how much to the offices, such as the NK√ö, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in his case is structured in a way that is somewhat different, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Also the powers are to some extent anal√≥gas, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control the federal money, what we call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
With regard to the local law, is simpler than ours?
Generally, I would like to establish a comparison with no specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but we cannot specify exactly what is best.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
That is certainly not, but, I repeat, I do not like to make such comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must cope with a large number of problems.
If it were not so, they do not pose any real benefit to collaborate with our office, do you not think?
With regard to the laws of our country, what it meant for her Office the amendment bill on public contracts? Somehow expresses its incidence?
Considering that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, has not yet been expressed in the actions of control.
Given that we make ex post controls, we need to have a certain delay.
For now, there is in the process of preparing future controls: We have started a new tool for detecting "non-economic risks," for which we have done spend almost 14,000 public contracts, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as they are modified the limits, are the conditions of some types of the selection process and similar.
Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, it is a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that is the case.
The problem that can arise is that the legislation "harden" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
As with the previous rules, controlled people were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law does not respected in terms of public contracts meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then harden the law in this way?
I do not think in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of him and not to punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on the decision-making process.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how it comes out of this?
We will see where it takes us this path begun.
The prime minister has recently declared that the ODS would not harass businessmen with control of the so-called ≈°varc system, with reference to the fact of being self-employed only on paper. What does this mean?
Does the ≈°varc system "is banned or permitted?
The law should be regulated in some way, and if something forbidden, then even the prime minister of the government can prevent the performance of the Office which has an obligation to carry out such checks and demand obligations.
You can say: "We change the law and allow it," but could not say that we will do as if nothing.
The law on the public contracts, the regulations are very strict in terms of the way in which we must act formally. And that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that exclude the candidate with the best bid for failing to comply with the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we are missing.
The roads are ice plates, although mostly impassable
In several places in the Czech Republic roads have plates of ice and snow.
Although most of the roads impassable, in some caution must be increased.
Karlovy Vary region
This morning the roads in the region of Karlovy Vary were passable, but showed plates of ice and snow.
The temperature drops and between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day will rise slightly thermometers.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low-lying areas the snow cover is thin.
By contrast, on the ridges of the Montes Met√°licos snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places the visibility was still poor because of fog, according to the information from the control center of operations of the roads in the region.
The fast-track R6 and first-class highway in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to exercise caution, particularly in some bridges whose surface can be icy and slippery.
Moreover, they are also guaranteed all avenues of second and third category, including mountain roads.
However, in some of them there are still sections with remains of ice and snow packed.
We need to increase the attention on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Europe and Hradec Kr√°lov√© region
Some roads in eastern Bohemia there is danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains may have formed a layer of snow on the tracks, reported in its pages the Directorate of roads and highways.
Operators of roads warn drivers about the danger to form ice plates, especially in higher areas of the region of Pardubice.
Frost may occur in the vicinity of Lan≈°krouna, √öst√≠ nad Orlic√≠, Poliƒçky, Svitav or Vysok√©ho M√Ωta, and especially on the roads of second and third category.
The roads R / 43 and I / 34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow on the roads of the Krkono≈°e mountains to Orlick√© hory.
There is a layer of snow packed in upland areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Knƒõ≈ænou and Trutnov.
In the area of the eastern Bohemia, the sky will be clear today and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures typically range between three below zero and a positive grade, which a weak wind.
Of Pilsen region
The roads in the region of Pilsen impassable today in the morning, but must be increased caution and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some ways could also be covered with ice.
In some places the drivers will find themselves in fog, but the visibility will improve gradually.
This is what emerges from the information from the control center of operations of roads in the region.
The highway D5 is passable almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to exercise caution, especially on the road between 80 kilometre and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of Plze≈à and Tachov bordering Germany may have sections with ice sheets.
The second and third category are damp, so that, in this case, it is also warns tranches with ice sheets.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the roads less traveled in the ≈†umava area.
Of Olomouc region
The drivers who turn to higher areas of the region of Olomouc will find snow partially discarded.
After the chemical treatment, there was snow in the port of ƒåervenohorsk√© and on the path towards Videlsk√Ω K≈ô√≠≈æ.
Road workers took off the snow during the night; on the road from ≈†umper accumulated about three inches of snow, according to the administrators of the tracks.
In the rest of the region, most roads impassable without restrictions.
"In the highest parts of the ≈†umper road, remnants of snow.
Drivers in the port of ƒåervenohorsk√© will find snow means discarded in the direction of Jesen√≠k, "confirmed today an operator of the administration's road to the ≈†umper ƒåTK.
On the ground and at night attended the Jesenick√° also his colleagues and, after the chemical treatment, the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the road from Olomouc roads impassable without restrictions, the drivers of ≈†ternbersk√° should lead with caution in the forest sections, where the tracks are still damp.
Region of √öst√≠ nad Labem region and Liberec
The operators of the roads in northern Bohemia have reported complications in various sections in the early hours of the morning.
Apart from some places where has snow or ice cream, according to the database of the police the mountain road between Telnice and Kn√≠nice in the region of √öst√≠ nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero, even in the lower areas, so that the ice and snow obviously remain on the carriageway. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the south-east of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and roads, in general, are dry.
The mmento have not been registered complications of service.
Road operators have been alerted to the presence of ice in the vicinity of ≈†tƒõt√≠.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal overnight. During the day is expected rain and snow that melts and in the evening the sky will be cleared and there will be ice.
Since the general roads have been announced unfavourable conditions on the road I / 13, on the border between the region of √öst√≠ nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kn√≠nice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the path to the weight of the snow.
Ornest ≈†imon: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in less than a month will reach the end of the world, what do you think about that?
It is only one among many other alarmist news to which we like agarrarnos.
The music group The Tap Tap we like rather make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only group of world music that manages to muster enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it.
In addition, in December a truly original project organiz√°is: Three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
It is a state charity event that we have been planning for two years ago.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar wording for December 21 at 11: 10 am.
The previous day, on 20 December at 21 hours, we will organise 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end up at approximately the same time that the Mayan calendar ends on the island Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to trying to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: Boots, T-shirts, bags and original key rings at the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the anthem at the end of the world, entitled "End of the world, cancelled."
Currently it is very popular on YouTube, can be heard in the charitable concerts?
Of course we do, and it will be just the last, well, if everything goes well and will not end the world...
The performers sing all at the same time in the three concerts.
U.S. anthems were to each other simultaneously, thanks to the special broadcast live on Czech Television.
Tom√°≈° Han√°k has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration?
We work together even with other figures from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charitable events and concerts.
We put all our efforts to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested in and amuses them to work with us.
What will be allocated the money raised through the concerts at the end of the world?
Equipment for the school without barriers Studeo, which we perform in its sixth consecutive year with the civil partnership Tap in Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav.
The students of the school of Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav regularly receive the visit of teachers with those who make fun and interesting activities.
The students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and do a efuerzo to make this possible.
In the context of the completion of the works in Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav, there will be a separate building to which we will move to this project.
In each concert act several groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will act Chinaski, Support lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan B√°rta, The Tap Tap, Mari√°n Bango and Ji≈ô√≠ Such√Ω.
For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
Do you have scheduled another "spectacular" similar action in the future?
In May, we will act for the first time in the festival Pra≈æsk√© bird, so here surely we will prepare a program attractive with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me, personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and in Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, until now have done for example in Madrid, Brussels, London, or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It is not so difficult to how it might seem at first glance.
There are five members in electric wheelchair, chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and in addition we carry much weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, until now we have managed well. ƒåSA and British Airways were well prepared, which never ceases to amaze me.
Even in Moscow, where we have returned recently, went all without problems.
Thanks to the exits abroad can compare the different society's attitudes towards the disabled and other aspects.
What you have found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia, we have seen that, in the east, there is still a long way to go.
Unlike in Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still not common for a person moves alone for the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as ordinary as it is, for example, give preference to someone in a wheelchair in the elevator, there is not.
Fortunately, it has created a civil partnership that strives to focus attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
In what ways we must follow the example of more advanced countries?
There are many ways in which we are going behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and the improvement of the situation always depends on the people it affects directly.
In London and Madrid is quite normal for people with a severe disability travel on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, where you go.
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate in social life actively, in this respect, with The Tap Tap let go a little bit ahead!
A society respectful or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes in which arise eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will begin to change everything really.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great force of will.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look at a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav, where he had many young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç, we were a little hands (laughs).
However, the popularity did not arrive until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, it is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the aid from the European Union, we can afford to also quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Do you had intended to go as far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that he had, that something can be done differently.
The entertainment world is full of things that seem to each other.
It is logical, in their own way, everything new is viewed with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings that suffer and that we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on condition, of course, that has the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for them to people with disabilities, then, is not only a breakthrough for them, but for society as a whole.
How Assisted the fact that you are a demanding boss, as he describes many people?
If we want to do a good job, we have to be rigorous in many respects and require some discipline.
I think it is completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, the group The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of the year 1998?
Only one: L√°ƒèa Angeloviƒç.
We are a group open, people will come and go, cannot be avoided.
Anyone who has the will and desire will always open doors
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, Brno Fl√©da and Plynojem will participate in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected by the end of the evening via video conference jointly to sing the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance the school multifunctional equipment without barriers STUDEO Jedliƒçk≈Øv √∫stav in Prague, costing 25 million korunas.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry into the option of advance sales in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers from the countries of the European Space Agency held last week accepted Poland as twelfth member of ESA. This is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years participated in the commission of the agency's projects.
However, the path of Poland to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts are already engaged in flights into space before World War II, though not always understood their work.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. ≈†ternfeld in the astronomical observatory in Warsaw where, on 6 December 1933, presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics."
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, ≈†ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In the year 1934 ≈†ternfeld scored in France the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andr√© Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to cosmonautics."
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), mentioned above, later turned into a big driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
Published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and its contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in the year 1925 was built in Poland a dresina that was going to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and did not know details of the project.
It is not clear whether the rocket was going to be used to boot the dresina or for braking.
The information on this dresina is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
Beginning in 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote themselves to the missiles.
The research was funded by the Kom√≥rka techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
On the basis of the material preserved, it becomes clear that the investigation came to the stadium of the tests in practice.
However, with the arrival of German troops, was interrupted the investigation.
In 1937 appeared in the press the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohozi≈Ñski and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza," the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of the engines for missiles.
Shortly before the war, the interim scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all the projects of missile technology for military use and coordinate all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In November 1954 edition of the magazine Problemy referred for the first time to society with four articles very extensive devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, the prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be devoted to cosmonautics.
At that time had already been launched projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956 Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM sounding rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket that carried out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first released on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach the 5 kg of weight.
Later, was completed version RM-1A and in the summer of 1959 began air tests of the rockets RM-2 two stages in the desert of B≈Çƒôd√≥w.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket would be the subject of real scientific study. The rocket RM-34 would have a heyday of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind of height.
However, in 1962 were suspended the work.
The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight 32.5 kg.
Developed three types (so-called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were different from each other for the space available for scientific equipment.
In the rocket Meteor-1A space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum height in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 was developed in the Air Institute the Meteor-2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km altitude.
Was later built the Meteor-2H version and Meteor-3.
We must also mention the entry of Poland in the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In the framework of the programme Interkosmos, Poland joined the investigation into the cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladim√≠r Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social traabajos law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to examine the existing problems from a broader point of view.
The liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
As a result, this means that the various forms of economic and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason lies in the principle of free trade and free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with rampant financial speculation.
The effect of the big differences in labour costs (salaries) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, is trying to shorten distances and for this "causes a bajadda" in the price of competitor to take over the bulk of the market and thus increase their profit margin.
On a large scale means, for most entrepreneurs, shifting production abroad, buy it cheaper or disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared with other economies, is higher.
Because the private capital does not have any social responsibility and, with it, nor is it responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, grows necessarily social spending in the state.
This whole situation leads to the total disinterest of employers to pay taxes and to compensate for the social and economic damage that have caused in their pursuit of profit.
The situation is universally so well known that it is not necessary to present concrete statistical data.
Less than honest practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of reducing artificially social level of one's own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
Put another way, governments put private capital available to its own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes to the existing laws.
The aim is to force the people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in terms of wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of financial liability in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the right of employees restricted in terms of labor rights.
The result is a growing poverty, along with the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
For a number of years, there are points in Germany delivery of food for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving such aid arrives at million already.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a case quite common: People employed with a wage so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary for survival.
It issued a scandal of this type relating to the situation of the German federal parliament's auxiliary staff.
The saving measures of virtually all of the southern states of the EU are, without a doubt, the same situation. People, under pressure from an abysmal decline of its social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or malvivir with a very bad salary on the edge of society, in the hope that one day arrives in the country's private investor capital.
Is it necessary preguntrarse where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny portion of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media say ad nauseam that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, to lead the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy meddling in control.
Then, it is necessary to ask whether private capital has no influence with his selfishness on the political march and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly yes.
The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in the mutual favours, legislation that is virtually reprehensible everywhere, but it is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is this: The state ministries, in the absence of financial resources, charged with drafting bills to private law firms, which are often linked to the industry.
Such bills are approved later in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, not all power emanates from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation that describes how Appi√°nos in his book The crisis in the Roman republic in times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state took time disintegrating and administrations are occupied by force."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread without any impediment and the people went to the polls to vote apalabrado beforehand... "" had not people with character showed it to aspire to a post in the administration, so once, as a result of this disruption, the state was eight months without consuls "..." He commenced to talk seriously that the only remedy for a situation as serious was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a strong man... "Although Appi√°nos thought in Pompeii, Cesar rose to power and transformed democracy forever in autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way that in ancient times, is that today's society is based on inconsiderate preferences of individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is not able, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as then, a decline of the unprecedented elite, without made an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of the communist and fascist regimes must be sought, therefore, in the unbridled liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal-type democracy, as a pause defined, awaiting the next blow.
The fact that the elite is really devastating current completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know it in the ancient history and the most recent one.
The suspension of the law on public contracts is not the solution, at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from the economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systemic.
The solution is to concrete socio-political reforms, which will strengthen both the participation of the state capital as the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The laboratory of the chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (There is nothing of violence and nothing could do so), Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (let us not forget how fragile we are).
"If my children do not want war, there would be no" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, have emerged, as always, mixed reactions.
One, on the side of Israel, argues in favour of the right of self-defense and cast in the role of the Palestinian terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleged racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and accused Israel of terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated regularly and who is the victim. In the end, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and not lived the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, a look to discover who benefits from the tensions left over from 95 years ago (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others in conclusions that I have come on the basis of my own way to understand the issue, on who or what group of people is the main driver of the events in modern history.
In the history of humanity the history of the struggles for power is in the front row.
Each time we can find an Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
But what is not so clear is whether these characters were always those who ran in his footsteps autonomously or if behind his throne had someone who directed his actions toward a particular goal.
We have to accept that we live in an era that concentrates wealth in the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and power that this implies, it has not been able to get in a single generation.
Among these families astronomically rich highlights one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but does not exclude): The Rothschild.
It is not much to write about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s of the nineteenth century bought the first news agency (Reuters) to cease to associate his name with criminal acts of great seriousness. The power and wealth, or both, they covered the backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost all the world's central banks and in those countries that are not represented, has said or is preparing a war: Before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq were 5, after overthrowing Qaddafi were only four, but in the meantime Russia has imposed the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has attempted to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank, Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the War of Secession to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (EDF) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of the year 1929.
His quest for global power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to chart a plan with three world wars, designed by the Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the degree 33.
The first war espoused eliminate the big states royalists throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially from Britain, and the third intended to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (such an amount of slaves for their well-being and would not luxury and will consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the final adoption of the absolute powers.
The method with which operates the group of the richest families, along with the Rothschild, follows the dynamics of the outbreak of crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order ab cao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always carry a worsening situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created to prevent a repeat of a crisis like the one in 1907.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo and after that, as a result, the onset of the First World War, destroyed Tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended so suddenly and unjustified since the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end the Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
To prepare the ground of World War II, allowed bankers and politicians to create, so covert, a situation of conflict in the wake of the huge war reparations imposed on Germany, which created the conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Later, was enough to serve them with the Germans the solution of the F√ºhrer, which was strong enough and simple and pointed to guilty, and build a Czechoslovakia after composed of various nationalities with a strong German minority that was supposed to represent and represented so well the function of the fifth column, who ignited the flame and led to the outbreak of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild drove the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch who aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out: It is difficult to know whether Hitler threw too much from the rope to which it had tied international bankers initially or if all he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the global society.
Israel was founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for the Second World War, with the proclamation of the state of Israel was created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers managed to start, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now with the Arab population and, generally, the Muslim Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only in the context of their country, but also internationally. Take as an example how to divide so clear supporters and detractors of Israel.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in a never-ending spiral of violence, if at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their quest for global power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders, because, as happens in our country, international bankers only presented their candidates in the elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20% of the entire global oil (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are now the words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new person he implanted a chip at birth that controls his entire being.
"And obliges all, large and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on the right hand or forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they carry the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand this: Those with two fingers in front, which reduces the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six. "
Film Argo: If you put crude oil, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of the demonstration of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was going to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed R√©za P√°hlevi, which after the revolution he fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
The situation for the American administration did not offer any positive outlook: Throw the Shah overboard could not afford it, because, if it did, jeopardized the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the formation of the theocratic regime, was not available.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later escalated further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days after the intervention of the Algerian government negotiator.
In the US, its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" director and actor Ben Affleck addresses an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, escaped six employees of the building.
After a complicated journey, ended up at the residence of the Canadian embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, so that helped a covert history an extravagant point: Came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the filming of an overproduction of science fiction.
Combination of genres
The plan that he drew the expert in "exfiltraci√≥n" Toni Mendez required the cooperation of Hollywood.
For lying seems truthful, wrote about the film project in specialized magazines, organized press conferences, the fictional production company had even a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of various genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie," the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example might be the series Ocean's Eleven).
In the film combines the moods. We find on the one hand well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are emblematic photographs of the time of the events, which were set forth in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical scenes of Hollywood somewhat lighter, marked by the irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes from the CIA and other institutions: Men who analyzed each the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career as an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the subject of ridicule, has become a respectable director and their ways has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Adi√≥s small, Farewell" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film by Affleck where the action has no place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Similarly, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that put the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck is shown in Argo, where Tehran is "wheel" in Canada.
The best scenes from the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the events true. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive for its concise capacity that, at the same time, transmitted the excitement of the confusion and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history is a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect on the fictitious scenes (the team impostor in the Tehran bazaar).
Action in too many places too much
The director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the way of the film's most intriguing scenes.
And manages quite well. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: Here is not everything in a way so elegant (the scene in which lurks the crisis at the airport in Tehran, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled pursuit after its runway become crazy).
The weakness of Argo is going off the rails that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Neuwirth and John Goodman have a very funny role as collaborators of Hollywood, although their characters deserved more space and are not, let alone, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, the movie Affleck loses a little dramatic stroke, but it is a film that we can continue with a moderate interest, assess their realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But will collapse, this will be difficult.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof that it can be exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services, is sufficient.
Rules for the inflated balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey on bank rates more absurd, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd ideas or regulation of the workshop of the EU."
"We came after the last event, the EU is planning to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women in management positions in the major European companies," explained pr√°vo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify the insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women are aventajaban of better prices in the life insurance because objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas of the EU workshop can be proposed by the people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of the month of February 2013, "reported Nacher.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, adding fuel to the compulsory biocomponentes that, as a result, damages the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers throughout life just because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline shadow the size of the cages for hens, which has contributed to a substantial increase in the price of eggs this year.
The ban has been criticized factual to use the expression "spread butter" or the withdrawal of the classic light bulb in the shops.
A banana quality must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The device of the Union takes such decisions often under pressure from one or the other industrial or commercial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are usually defended by any state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of their banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that higher-quality bananas in the EU should have a length of at least 14 inches and could not present "abnormal bends."
The European Commission defended himself by saying that with this only seeks to harmonise national rules homogenized not to date, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules that make reference to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of food.
The candidate to win the poll could be the prescription of the EU last year, according to which the inflatable balloons that are marketed is obligatory to warn that children under 8 years are not allowed to puffing them up without adult supervision.
The US referred to an American study here, according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death by asphyxiation.
It is also in force a similar restriction applicable to the use of matasuegras by children up to 14 years.
Strange occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: Anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. So as not to offend the sensibilities of Greece, is due to speak of FYROM (Former know Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovn√≠poplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists following components, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union over the volume of food stocks in the territory of a member state.
The EU ruled the maximum volumes of food supplies can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
Later, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which meant a threat of substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey are also interested the occurrence of pay for those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application of subsidies.
This kind of ideas not emerged in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because they do not have sea.
We ask the European Union compensation, "he declared in the autumn of 2004 the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ƒåSSD).
I argued with the fact that in our country there was much grain and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was ready to help the Czech Republic and organized a public competition for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Nƒõmec (US-DEU). In particular, is aimed at drafting requests for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the member states are often the target of criticism, the EU's efforts in the field of regulations and, also, a more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve more, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that the member states have achieved in negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs are also strikes a chord, in the same way that other countries of the Union, the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these fights.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Ricotta of Olomouc, but they had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, and became known as "tuzem√°k."
Only the products made from distilled from sugar cane can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
On the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, along with the feta cheese and Gorgonzola known all over the world, the German city of L√ºbeck marzipan or Parma ham, are already such cookies of Karlovy Vary, the carp from Poho≈ôelice and T≈ôebo≈à, and even the variety of hops in ≈Ωatec.
As maras protected from the EU, can be proud of the gingerbread from Europe and the wafers of Ho≈ôice v Podkrkono≈°√≠.
People want to save the republic, but I am a fan, says Okamura
Mr Senator, how it happened stand for election for president?
It is not about being a senator or president.
If in our country was so good, then he would not pursue my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how they draw in the last 20 years in our country, how the thieves go unpunished, increasing taxes and retirement age.
He had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something that I do not like, I try to give a solution to change it.
And since I already have 40 years and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to present myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has been put on the way to the presidency.
Do you not is turning its back on those who have voted?
Always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the election of the Senate.
Leaving precis√© later that if elected senator, would present my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool that I can make my own ideas.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we are critical in the bar or in front of the television, but we drive down to anyone who wants to initiate a change.
This is compounded by the media, which undermine and confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lying.
Me it is said to have bribed journalists or that I have been an adviser to Ji≈ô√≠ Paroubek.
We are going to talk about their ideas.
It presents to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over 20 million.
To this must change the law.
As president does not have this competition and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a group of pressure to guide the craft was recognized as self-employment, and we succeeded.
The problem is in politics: If someone comes up with a good proposal, either right or left, was rejected by the way, and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to get the support of all the parliamentary groups.
Without encasillamientos nor dogmas of party, I have the ability to be able to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
It considered more of a left-wing or right-wing man?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that the people I considered more left-wing.
For me it is not important, whether it's a little left or right-wing a little.
What matters to me is that we come out ahead.
I do not care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to unite people.
Always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSƒåM or SDGs and, by the same token, I am against the bad ideas.
A joke when they say to you that it is populist.
But it is not showing with what he says?
When you create a business plan for the company, you have also certain goals and ideals.
And try to get to them.
There will be those who call populism, but all proposals of which I speak now operate in the world or known experts speak of them.
But without the support of the parliament only slogans.
And this cannot survive in the long-term policy.
Or do you believe that if it is aimed at people and talk to them, will, for example, a financial and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my part to achieve it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in arranging a broadcast live on TV in which would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties that lend legitimacy to the financial and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors in the state.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why do not want.
If there is a strong character that points out the disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Take for instance the direct election of the president, who has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say that I'm just a fan, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals attempt to seek allies.
I just start in politics and try to obtain the greatest possible support for my program.
I try to take things forward myself, but if they do not get it right, within six years, and I will leave it to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like if Okamura would save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that a person does not do anything, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, if you may animaran to present his candidacy for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janƒçura, but refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov√°, which brought to light the fraud with light heating oils.
I presented on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, I am now in the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls, and those who did, voted to the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate are two of the independent sector.
The people chose the Senate, so that it will be difficult to achieve change.
However, I I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming his own party?
I have not yet seen because I do not have time to do so, to check the past unblemished from each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I have no money or for the campaign for the presidency, in my mind transparent there are only 20,000 crowns.
Do you not have money?
Talk of statements from the property, how is it yours?
I think my private property in some 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot of land valued at 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another floor appraised in eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin about 3.5 million and a ≈†koda Superb valued at one million, and the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving the car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against the evil deeds and injustices.
Do you take an Aston Martin, his property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but does not want to put too much money on his part.
It is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to endeudarme?
In the campaign, I have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that it does not have any sponsor shows that there is not much interest in my program.
And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The cost of the campaign cover essentially what will I receive in salary concept of senator.
But it could not live it. For example, could not pay my son English school, which costs 30,000 kroner per month.
If I would only make money, then I would not as a candidate.
So it will continue with its business activity in order to live?
Surely has said before that he was going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, in part I have left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
People would want to be the Samaritan that saving the republic.
But I also need to live something.
How much accustomed to earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I still winning.
If I were president, then would leave the business.
You can see the entire interview in the Saturday edition of pr√°va.
The study of architecture MVRDV shows that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think that the building is fun, has a futuristic look, and finally there is something interesting to do," said Lisette Verhaig, a bystander who passes through the streets.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one goes for taste in these libraries pass√©, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a city bedroom located at the gates of Rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honor of having risen to a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants presents the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this situation so shameful, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute in any way to the general culture and copy the seven bridges fictitious appearing represented in the euro notes in the form of thumbnails of reinforced concrete decorated.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was as policy makers decided that there was only one way to improve the statistics: Had to build a library!
Winy Maas, the study of Dutch architecture MVRDV, a master in the art of the bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings as well as cynical, took the issue with his usual serenity and appeared to the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under my arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked perplexed around them and encog√≠a shoulders, Maas proceeded to pile the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'. "
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rises on the runway.
It is part of the revitalization project, complete with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a pair of detached houses and buildings.
In early November, the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012."
In this way, the small town devoid of history, which so far had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall after whose white facade one intuir√≠a rather a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has public cultural building the first in its history.
The long road to the book
The first impression is that this is a paradise of books under a cheese.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right at the heart of this massif, but the true lovers of space and reading does not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of his climbing to the top.
The interior is fully glazed light and easy to cover with the view, the brick floor annealing and elegant streetlights unequivocally support the condition of the public library.
The urban environment is perfect.
To raise the view can get to see the banks of the park, the dogs and children playing football.
And for all sides books, books and more books.
"Normally the shelves of books are arranged along the facade and the centre opens a huge dark room that, in general, tends to be a little uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done here is to put an upside down the classic spatial configuration and draw the reading area of the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is well taken: In the middle are the offices, the library of the Internet, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
They deserve special mention black shelves to assume the functions of mural coating, plexiglass barricade and at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strangers.
Even the architects and engineers civilians more up-to-date shake their heads when they hear about this material unknown.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," he explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that is how one day, on a farm Friesland, we are met with the appropriate byproduct from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands used a plastic fabric of a few millimetres thick as a base to hold the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This tissue lasts two seasons and then discarded.
This is for the library prens√≥ fabric, for the first time in such quantities, to get plates of four centimeters thick.
With the heat and the pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark material, homogeneous and resilient that smells like a mixture of new car and sports shoe.
After 105 steps to the top of the mountain. "
At the end of this route continues nearly 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: From the cafeteria not only has a fantastic view of the city, but it also can enjoy some delicious Dutch croquettes and its ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere on par with the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although deduce given its large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The heating and cooling needed are obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun shines for only a few hours inside.
The huge wooden cerchas located in cross-cutting sense the glass facade serve to provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable interior climate.
The rest is a thing of the automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptic sector worker from the Information Technologies, already has dared to put your foot on the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, Professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes the "Boekenberg" as the "soul" of Spijkenisse late.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the opening that took place a couple of weeks ago, it invited all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book from his private collection.
In this way it aims to fill, for the moment, the optical holes of a library that does not yet have a complete file; today it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has appreciated.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
It is only there to embellish.
In this way, the study MVRDV has achieved a great success in that discipline that reigns in the specialized slang is known as "creating an identity."
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
No matter how young, uneducated that may be.
Finally a starting point for shaping its identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a leading role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US relations. UU.-Europa, this puts Berlin in a very difficult diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany hinted that he would vote against the proposal to grant to the Palestinian territories statehood United Nations observer.
However, finally Berlin abstained.
Why? "
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany should be careful.
But at the same time I think that neither supports the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it is aimed at establishing a no-fly zone.
This has been declared finally by NATO.
Do you find it difficult to Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, it is.
This is because at the moment is shifting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and by focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes it even more things is that Europeans do not have a coherent policy and uniform.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to do so.
I think we are still exploring what their role, but they have already begun the path towards a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to the countries such as France or Britain.
What does it mean specifically a "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, stands ready to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, that is to say, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other major powers and that is why Germany must protect their interests.
Are these economic interests have influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and in the vote of the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, must be careful and not alienating Arab public opinion nor of Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would give him so much importance because it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they play a key role in the German considerations.
Germany has undermined its relationship with the US to abstain from voting on important decisions as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a huge level of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been a drastic break as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps with that Germany has managed to gain some respect.
In the end, all this has only to show that it is a country which taken seriously as an international player and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
By contrast, the US has shown clearly in favour of a veto.
Is there disparity of views between the US and many European nations?
There have always been these disparities due to American domestic politics.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding towards the European position.
But, because of the political situation that live here, it is clear that the government cannot defend in public that position.
I believe that the real disparity of views is not actually the scale that is attributed to him.
If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all excited about the policy that develops.
Do you find it difficult to reconcile the Germany maintains close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its major partners in the EU, on the other?
I believe that it is precisely that what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent European policy and homogeneous, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the chance to be part of an upper body, but should push things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will assume a leadership role in forcing Europe to adopt a European approach.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, whether it is simply because of the relationship that maintains with Israel.
This has always been a difficult issue.
But I think that the Germans have clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
It sees Germany itself in the role of a major international actor? Do you want to actually Germany to assume a leading role?
Or perhaps it is still proving difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet been used, it is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time that Germany is positioned as a leading actor, will unleash certain antialemanes feelings.
This is not easy for the Germans.
It is an old problem and is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The influence of the U.S. in European politics increasingly decreases, but the EU does not cover for the moment that vacuum, who is then?
The Germans will have no choice but to take a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like, if they find it unpleasant or if they become a people even more unpopular, c'est la vie!

"Trademark protection" in China: When Puma and Armani become suddenly in Chinese brands
Armani is a brand known worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is it Armani Polo?
After this name hides a designation officially registered in China, but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection while the real ep√≥nimos did not submit a demand.
And even then, it is not clear that they will give the reason.
"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Each week arrives at my table a new case.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny.
German companies also copied legally in the same way, as has happened to the sporting goods maker Puma.
Pattloch opens a file cabinet in which holds seats the trademark office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company applied to register the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that is also served by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese are world champions in that copying and of violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are stores several floors devoted exclusively to the sale of counterfeit.
However, the cases are other Pattloch. On behalf of their clients, he fight against the fact that the trademark office officially granted to Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a designation that is already registered in another place.
What the Chinese call "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan,"
That refers to women who have "fish" to a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It is bad for the business, we have to fight it," requires Pattloch.
"The brand is waters, the monopoly position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the court of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, China is, in size, the third luxury goods market, which is growing faster.
However, achieving the cancellation of registration of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and involves a lot of money.
The processes can extend up to nine years, and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had passed that the name under demand already had become a "market reality."
"If the plaintiff has a bad luck, maybe even have to pay money to the plagiador because the process has damaged the brand in China," says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery maker SANY, the company that has been taken over recently by the German manufacturer Putzmeister concrete pumps.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
The buyer of Volvo, Geely, initially used a blue-and-white logo that he remembered largely to BMW; the matter is determined in the courts and Geely had to amend it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which represented a crocodile logo looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The trademark office in Beijing CTMO recognizes that in 2010 have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the labour emergency situation returned to normal."
In this way, the number of processes of claim without process has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of those cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending.
It costs a lot of money fight
As is usual in China, the numbers are startling.
Last year the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China is heading for the tenth consecutive year the list of new registrations worldwide, according to notes the trademark office.
It seems that this also applies to the number of valid logos, a figure amounting to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, would have pocketed 1.8 billion yuan in concept of rights.
Put another way, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fight that costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group fight in the courts against a Chinese copier.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of car parts of imitation,
The copier has managed to ensure the Chinese rights on the brand Freudenberg.
"We ourselves have led to this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected," said Hanno Wentzler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO also dismissed the appeal of the muniqueses.
In the following two instances have given reason to Freudenberg, but the opposing party is still fighting today.
We have to be very careful
Now the case has come to the gates of the High Court of Justice, which is still pending.
Wentzler hopes to resolve the issue and welcomed praise the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the business file has had to review cases of up to 100 years old to be able to give evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "six-figure sum in euros," with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement, but did not succeed.
"This shows how much we care about," says Wentzler.
The dangers that lurk in the Far East threaten even affect Europe,
Specifically, if the imitators ensuring there the rights on trademarks are not protected.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long abandoned this commercial area, however managed to prevent the registration.
"We have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend to German companies that are extremely cautious about doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what we need to do is to "register in China anything that might be susceptible of protection," as Wentzler points.
Otherwise, the issue could be much more expensive than a simple registration.
Indeed, in the event that Freudenberg lost the last round of their particular battle, then it would have to pay to the opposing party licence fees for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question expulsar√≠an us of the market.
World day of the fight against AIDS: Dance, sing, help
In Heidelberg tested the chorus Imbongi and Swaziland are happy orphans of AIDS
The story of a link able to overcome a lot more than 8.733 miles away.
First you start by dancing: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high-heeled shoes and mocasines seek compass on the parquet floor, and they are quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then will begin to rise slowly the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano), arremolin√°ndose, entorpeci√©ndose and sigui√©ndose each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the director of 29 years, threatens to get away almost their boxes in trying to bring order to his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg chorus Imbongi is trying a new song.
They have also reached the 50 singers, aged 23 and 69 years, since the human geneticist until house husband.
"Om 'Obani" is not an easy piece, every voice of the choir has a different text and also in a foreign language hardly known: The Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
The self-help aid
According to an estimate of UNAIDS, the United Nations program for the fight against AIDS, globally, there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany godparents for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of eSitjeni.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover tuition at the school, the uniform and guarantees a hot meal a day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "narrator of stories" or "panegirista."
No one in this room knows speak fluent this Bantu language, but they do know how to sing.
Ten years ago this chorus tested songs on this soft foreign language that sometimes fails to carry them to their place of origin: Southern Africa.
To 8.733 miles away as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called eSitjeni that depends on the voices of this German chorus.
The forty percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts of mud and straw, a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
ESitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: The rate of AIDS infection highest and lowest life expectancy around the world, according to UNICEF.
The population does not look favourably on circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce by half the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and die with something more than thirty years has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the chorus discovered this hidden population, but what they saw especially were many children in the streets that were not only for the protection of their parents, but the main thing: Food, clothing and training.
Without school title, the possibilities in a poor country are slim.
Initially it was only the particular commitment of a few what made it possible for a child outside the school and will enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year after the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" that has since been occupied professionally for orphans of AIDS in eSitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the ETS bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
STDs of origin are the most common AIDS virus, the human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
The ladillas and scabies are among the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more frequently in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute on the basis that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults sexually transmitted diseases are more common chlamydia infections, tricomonas, human papilloma virus, thrush (fungus) and gonorrhea.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, about 20% of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among the young, chlamydia infections are much more common than other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged between 15 and 25 years.
In our country, the human papilloma virus also adds to the most common diseases among young people.
How has evolved the number of infections?
Not all the sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections maintains a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
It is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, inconvenience when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often they do not cause pain or other symptoms cause and therefore are not detected.
How can you protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but do not offer protection to one hundred percent.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt infections and physical contact.
For this reason, the experts recommend regularly undergo medical examinations, especially if it is often changes of sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured, and it is possible to avoid any late consequence.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees it charges the chorus for his performances throughout Germany, come to raise enough money.
"We have sent a total of about 200,000 euros in eSitjeni anymore," says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In his own people Zodwa Dlamini a woman self-confident and leadership skills administers the money sent from Germany.
Takes care of orphans to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as is called to older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans to his office, offer them a roof where live and care for children to go to school every day on time and in uniform.
Those who do not have anyone remain under the protection of Khanyisile, an unmarried woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary of the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, has built two poultry houses and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has made many of the villagers have been subjected to an HIV test.
This is not something obvious, since, despite the apparent that this disease is all around the country, it is not often speak openly about it.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king has officially 14 wives.
The Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This way of life is not officially accepted is largely responsible for the spread so fast that has experienced the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless seasonal workers around the country from one side to the other and that they take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner can get free condoms, but these are hardly used.
It is another culture, here only accept the skin against skin contact. "
To promote cultural exchange, the chorus Imbongi travels every two or three years for southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember the apartheid era.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in a language of blacks; both recognition not only brings with it a great atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to drag a few tears to some rabid border soldier.
The journey takes them to always eSitjeni, where the singers visiting children sponsored.
Despite the fact that this small population barely appears in maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is well known.
"Come to eSitjeni, there shines the light," says local people.
And after touring the 8.733 miles as the crow flies back to Heidelberg until the rehearsal rooms from the street Bergheimer full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see shine their light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Probably the ice cap has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there are also cooled water, as can be seen from three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science."
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow has formed a layer of ice.
It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 metres thick.
The water is presumably of comets or, with a high probability of asteroids that clashed against Mercury.
No one relates the discovery of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief investigator of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, the findings could help clarify how they have reached the water and other components of life to other parts of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots as the Phoenix are dedicated to explore the depths of the universe.

This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which appear endless generations of stars: The oldest stars are shown as blue points, although the most difficult thing to recognize is the pink color of the stars "babies."
This region of star formation, called so little romantic by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This image of a star tornasolada extinction was taken by the NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The ring-shaped is composed of the material that the star spits in its process of extinction.

The Spitzer telescope NASA took this photo of the galactic star formation.
The Pl√©yades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters," are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope can better appreciate the colors.
The Misty the Axial appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located at 700 light years in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity with a terrestrial continent has earned him the nickname of North America.

Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Misty Tr√≠fida located several thousand light years in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name comes from the Latin word "Tr√≠fida trifidus" (divided into three), since some dark dust lines divide the burning heart of this area of star formation in three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic snooker: 400 million light years from Earth in the nuclei of two galaxies abalanzan fusion process is the one to the other to finish colliding so hopeless.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.

The nebulous located 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between 10 and 100 times smaller than the dust particles that can be found in a house.
This image was created from optical imaging and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This cluster of galaxies called Arp 273, served for a time model for the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this fog is the group's brightest young stars in our Milky Way.
This area of stellar formation produces constantly new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Misty Rosette, also arise continually new star; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is not yet dust, gas alone.
The researchers assume that was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe could find particularly hydrogen.
Our window on the universe: The most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes has not stopped growing and the images that we offer are becoming more depth.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
Her mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, stands the Large Binocular Telescope.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is enormous - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented in order to save costs.
Despite this, reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The drawback of this construction is cheaper than the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so their mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller-diameter mirror, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the infrared spectrum.
The ESO also will host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope and the European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These are two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and IRTTF.
On Mauna Kea is planning to build a new and daunting telescope with a diameter of mirror 30 meters.
This is a picture of how it would be.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 sends images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope search for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011 NASA announced that from the start of his mission had been located approximately 1,235 candidate planets.
In the image are the last preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror the space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be seeking the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the Big Bang.
The researchers assume that in the south pole of Mercury there is also ice.
However, there are no hard evidence, because the probe Messenger revolves around the globe in an orbit much closer to the North Pole.
For decades radar measurements suggest the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty that this is the case.

To the south of Azerbaijan many people manage to reach biblical age.
There is even a museum dedicated to the longevity.
A search for footprints in a country where people of 97 years are still considered young people.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus is moving forward with great din through the winding road that runs beside wooded hills, overflowing rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here to the border with Iran is only a few kilometres.
Here are the "talyshi," a people who do not know much, apart from that dominate perfectly Persian and Azeri and that they are very durable.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts a solid perhaps too architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit entirely in a mountainous landscape so picturesque.
European tourists barely come to this place, because the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, it is too heavy.
For touring the 323 miles separating the two cities, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The astonishing wealth of the country thanks to the oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this peripheral region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May during the celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we celebrate the Feast of the elderly people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Museum of the ILC, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the lives of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have exceeded 100 years old. Fatulayeva points to a picture in black and white.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A child died at the age of 136 years
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the pastor of sheep ≈ûirali M√ºsl√ºmov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies.
And if we take into account that the older man lived documented 122 years, it seems that the age of M√ºsl√ºmov is quite suspicious.
"Was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," he explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently still had time to conceive a child more at the age of 136 years.
Was it wrong then ≈ûirali M√ºsl√ºmov in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, geront√≥logo at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live people very advanced age," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about the age, especially when there is no civil registration.
Every day glasses filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, in a surprisingly common, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik tend to achieve a biblical age.
Today there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why they live here, in the south, so many elderly?
The tourist guide Azeri Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is special genes from the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the diet rich in calories from the talyshi, who love meat, bread and milk products and many of whom, moreover, drink a cup of melted butter, is so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
His 97 years is relatively young for what is customary for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, moving tirelessly a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of the sons and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents long ago.
Also cavort from one side to the other two small children.
In the kitchen preparing tea for the guests, a tea serving in a typical vessels with a curved.
The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and are perfectly aligned and under the headscarf conceals two long braids of dark blond hair that her son discovers us proud.
I have always wash your hair with milk, so I never has fallen and has maintained its color.
"I have never used either a shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
It has always eaten only what was in his own farm: Tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my life I have not gone never to make the purchase at a supermarket.
Then we talk of her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II.
However, everything came back on track when the "beloved father, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds strange in the mouth of a woman.
However, the cult in Azerbaijan to profess the fatherly figure of the nation, who runs his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when he gave up the baton to his son Ilham.
At least older people of Azerbaijan does not know what is poverty.
Mirzayeva collects 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) in monthly pension, an amount that you can live well, taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps the white son of Mirzayeva is right: "In our culture the elderly are highly respected."
They live in a big family, are beloved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this were not reason enough to stay alive many years...
In the Constitution lack the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous division that has gripped the country.
The future constitution, with Sharia law as a basis, it is very controversial.
The Egyptian president had no in pathos.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that is my responsibility, before the people and before God, "he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Coptic Christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular ones.
All of them, living without remedy so far in a confusing opposition, they are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As explained Mohammed Mursi, almost asking for forgiveness, has had to cancel temporarily the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand their own "in order to save the revolution."
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what the 61-year-old engineer with a PhD from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive of its power to the judiciary?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 members predominantly Islamists in a night meeting of 15 hours, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
However, what does that mean "principles"?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists are going to take this vague formulation, as well as the legal room for manoeuvre associated with it, to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This is at least suggesting a new article added: In all matters relating to the sharia is obligatory consultation with the Al-Ashar University, the country's largest Islamic institution with a great power throughout the Sunni Islam.
It need not be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the impairment of the judiciary.
Much of the draft of the constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that seeks to maintain the military jurisdiction.
During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts served to exert a harsh crackdown on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As set out in the draft, the State has to protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote their morals and values."
It is a very imprecise wording in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of the arts and literature.
Speaking clear this is not anything other than censorship.
By the way that no article stipulates explicitly equality between men and women.
On the other hand another prohibits offend or malign the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what is an offense and how it has to be punished.
Just as questionable is the formulation that prohibits the "insult to the people"
Is it sufficient a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer?
A matter of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to add to his signature and which, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be subjected to a referendum.
"The revolution has become"
Weeks ago that the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to derail the Minutes before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, which ranks third in the lists to the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize and ex-Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said that the draft of the constitution should be "in the dustbin of history."
Via Twitter accused supporters of Mursi of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy."
"When called the referendum will go to his palace and derrocaremos," says the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brethren has not yet been expiada," was quoted in the Egyptian media to the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that it wanted to supervise the referendum, so it would be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community appealed to hold a counter-demonstration; for if not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, at the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafis took part in the same to the rallying cry: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded to Mursi "clean up the country," at the same time proclaiming: "The Koran is our constitution."
A fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that the supporters of Mursi did not want to risk that something like this happen.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft of the constitution as supporters of the same would have expressed their opinions loud and clear.
Now it is time to let the people decide at the ballot box what direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists have guaranteed a majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' even appears"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this constitutional process forced that actually should have lasted until February and have included all social forces.
The 48-year-old lawyer specializing in human rights and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to cope with a trial during the dictatorship of Mubarak.
Not because share their ideology, but because for him the Human Rights are indivisible.
For this reason, he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' even appears in the new constitution," it regrets in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of the competences add to the three powers of the State made this lawyer resignara.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and lead to Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, which has made the president is to abolish it," regrets Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without the civil society organizations.
Saeda feel abandoned, also by the international community, which sees the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against them.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are discussing a monster that ye cannot control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: Is the world's most fish stinks?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country save some connection with their greed for an extremely smelly fish?
Take a series of excessively cured cheese.
Place them in the midst of a mountain of clothes wet and dirty football.
Leave it there a week.
You can then smell the aroma of the crippling rakfisk, one of the delicacies of Norway.
I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours of Oslo.
It is snowy. The scenery is spectacular and the smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is salted trout that leaves ferment in water, depending on what stinks that you prefer, up to a year.
As it is doing and colder, the Norwegians come in droves to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"It eats raw and then drink a glass of aquavit for a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, fireman of the city that is also what is known as the "General" Rakfisk, who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating the fish that is stored in small buckets and sipping a drink large quantities of the drink.
"Some people like aquavit that the rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I feel some pieces.
If you can avoid having fun near the nose, not bad; it is not very different from a portion of sushi has come a few miles by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty ravaged Norway and where, before the advent of refrigeration, the fish was kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the winter, when it is already well fermented, it draws and, obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, eats.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, higher wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of people in Sweden, the old rival and until not too much richer than Norway, come to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential part, although quite stinks, of the past Norway.
It is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer or a cane sandwich will cost a whopping 10 euros ($14) each.
Norway does not appear on the agenda of the international news and the majority of Norwegians likes it.
Here the people is still not ready to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist acribill√≥ who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of 22 July."
The Norwegians are finding it hard to believe that in his quiet country one of their own was able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of the current wealth of Norway is growth, since the early 1970's, one of the oil and gas industries largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, while going through rakfisk trays and who, with her long blond mane and their striking blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian welfare.
"We are, as you, prudent people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We do not like to boast, we do not like the ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except for a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was dissipating money that he had no during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway's wallet closed well maintained.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a laugh casual.
I am in the snow queuing up to eat something; I have already had enough rakfisk.
Now a hamburger moose is certainly something different and succulent enough to taste.
But at night, returns that stinks fish.
The hotel where should I stay is one of the many local held a dinner of rakfisk in which diners vote the best fish, or perhaps the most tested the nostrils.
A live television has connected with a leader who has been bow tie and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It seems the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here is our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by aquavit.
Or perhaps the vapors all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Pe√±a Nieto faces a tough start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, prepares to take office, the correspondent of the BBC, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges that will face the new president and the different expectations of its population.
The traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, under the best circumstances, it is already already congested, has been installed since Monday a steel fence that cuts several major roads leading to the city and that is causing a huge chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not prevent workers were able to reach their workplace, but to prevent the protesters could get to the parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and take over the management of the nation.
It faces a difficult task.
Mexico has been getting good economic performance during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is immersed in a war against the narcotr√°fco that has claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," explained Mr Pe√±a Nieto earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office.
"I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before rubbing shoulders with the president of the United States, the previous political experience of Mr Pe√±a was as governor of his home state, Mexico.
A very populous state and rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; The opinions on the new leader are divided on this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he recalls fondly.
Its residents attributed the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and infrastructure construction.
To reach the city can lead by one of the new roads of Mr Pe√±a Nieto, which represents a huge improvement compared with the roads agrietadas and full of potholes that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plates with his name at the entrance of a modern sports hall and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are confident that he will make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the party of Mr Pe√±a Nieto, the PRI.
"Particularly, in terms of security and economy, we hope the interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party, there are many expectations regarding Enrique Pe√±a Nieto.
The rating also rejects the opposition makes lack of substance of the new president.
"It is a man very sincere, very committed and with an excellent view of the country.
It is a great statesman and, above all, is a person who knows how to listen. "
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that it has a lot of people on his former governor.
En donde iremos "for Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be higher.
High hidden under sections of motorway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also tough and urban.
Earlier this year, called for the intervention of the military to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, have left abandoned in just the past two years the bodies of dozens of murdered women.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico, while Mr Pe√±a Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in Ciudad Ju√°rez, unfortunately, famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with killing of innocent women.
Critics of Mr Pe√±a Nieto say, in the best case, which failed to address the problem of feminicide while he was in office.
The most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the neighborhood deteriorated, Irinea Buend√≠a has to make efforts to contain the tears while I shows photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Moon.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, his family believes that her partner the murdered.
"When I came to his house, it seemed as if he had cleaned up the body," recalls Mrs Buend√≠a.
"There were signs that he had been beaten and rigour de la mort had already been published."
While his mother recounts the story, a photograph of Mariana notes from the walls, along with a cross which read a single word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says that he has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if it were an old chismosa, a disruptive, a quejica.
What they want is that one simply accept what they say and that street. "
"But that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and such negligence," he says.
The presidential sash that President Pe√±a Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico during the past six years, and the new president has promised to give them priority during his tenure.
"I hope it is the same kind of president who was when he was governor," says the member of the PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza more fear.
Bradley Manning not alleged ill-treatment, according to prosecutors
Prosecutors are trying to deal with allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning during his stay in prison
The trial focuses on the period of Manning at the military prison in Quantico in Virginia
The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that the imprisonment of Manning was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to show on Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to denounce the mistreatment that now claims that he suffered while he was under military detention.
During the questioning that the prosecutor's office undertook to Manning in a pre-trial hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that the records of weekly visits by officers from the unit that Manning received for nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment they received.
The questioning, which took place during a hearing conducted following a request by the defense to dismiss the case since his incarceration had been hard and that it had already made enough punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had considered suicide while in custody.
The Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while he was on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In the view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning forms that the officers were following visits to Manning during his detention at Quantico military prison, where he was imprisoned in maximum confinement regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have made questions to Manning and scored their answers.
On Friday, Fein when asked about the forms, Manning acknowledged that she had described the treatment that gave the warders as "excellent" and the treatment received in the facilities in general as "very professional."
The forms show no complaint of ill-treatment, despite the fact that the officers asked Manning directly on the treatment they received, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers who visited him had spoken these problems, and he had indicated that they would try, but that they were not aware of such issues on the record.
"Writing 'without incidents' (after having talked about the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem," said Manning.
The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not reported the treatment they received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council in charge of examining the intentions of suicide had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get the reduction of the regime of "prevention of injury" under which was.
The military said that he had been placed under the restrictive regime, which is a degree below the surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure their protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted to make the state more knew that I was well and (I wanted to) stop being under injury prevention... to be able to enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that they are not allowed to know what was going on or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world fell only to the Camp Arafjon, the cage," said Manning on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that, once moved to Quantico, spent most of the day in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some slippers, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, because it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes while sleeping.
He said that if the guards could not see him face when he gave a return at night, awakened him to return to turn around.
The lawyer for Manning in January 2011 filed a formal complaint about the treatment they received Manning.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning on a plea that he had done in Thursday's statement, according to which, one night after being forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, they forced him during a morning recount desdnudo to stand in front of the guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to be covered with a blanket during the recount.
During the interrogation of the judge on Friday, Manning said he thought by the order that gave him the supervisor that he should drop the blanket that could have been covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to leave the fall.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked last night because of an attempt to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flops for self-harm but had not done so.
Manning testified that that night had withdrawn from his cell his underwear, his flip-flops and his glasses.
His lawyers have the hope that the judge should have at least considered experiences that happened during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if convicted in the court martial, which is scheduled to start at the beginning of next year.
The defense said he intends to make Manning is guilty of lesser crimes and defend other accusations regarded as too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules applicable to any detainee who is under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, causing illegally publishing information on the Internet, leaking of national defense information and theft of public property or records.
If he is convicted of all charges, could face up to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who were; he says that remind Mexicans of those hard times
Navarrette says that the Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, barely had fallen by the esplanade and arrived in the area of immigration processing and was already totally confused.
Some posters showed the way towards two lines: One for Mexican "" and another for "Foreigners."
I was there for a few seconds without being sure where he should go.
Having grown up in Central California, throughout my life I have called "Mexican."
These are ethnic shorthand, in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends from New York define themselves "Italians."
Later I decided on "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in the homeland of my grandfather, the shorthand or the scripts were not necessary.
American was simply.
I speak Spanish. Well enough to salir during an interview in this language.
But I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native and I cannot get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I got in the tail of foreigners.
I thought at the time this week in which the president-elect of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always to meet the leaders of these two countries, included: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pe√±a Nieto was willing to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment is just as likely that a Mexican remain in Mexico as they venture to go to the United States.
He wants to be associated with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Pe√±a Nieto promised to continue the fight against the drug cartels in Mexico, although it did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of rancor.
Probably the majority of Americans will never remember that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to surrender half of its territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who believe in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that we remember him are everywhere.
So, at the moment when a staff member of the United States says anything that brings the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbours.
And the sons of Moctezuma are put on a war footing.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking of resentment?
There is a lot.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which is not the case.
The only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, it may be that the father or mother or any of the grandparents, which he closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And most of the time that person fit into a specific profile: Dark skin, a low level of education, from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal.
Mexico does not.
And, despite the fact that perhaps we are now living the American dream, having gone to good schools and have had good jobs, we must not lose sight of never that what we are seeing is that, the American dream, and not Mexican.
It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty yes it is.
It is for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class the people dislike us.
The feeling is mutual.
We see it as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and we look over his shoulder as if we were in a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In her view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, would not have gone.
And now, we would not be trapped behind this silk curtain, living in the United States but, even so, as solitary souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and wine legally to the United States when she was a little girl, I remember that there is this rubbing between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first know with more strength who they are and the seconds it bothers them.
Although it is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know they feel that they are not part of any of the two.
We love to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we see as Americans.
And in the United States, we were considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate things, so I have learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to re-connect with the diaspora.
They want the Mexican-Americans to work as "ambassadors" improvised Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would say to our fellow Americans how wonderful it is to visit that country and presionar√≠amos political leaders to strengthen its ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That is not going to happen.
There is too much rancor.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I am afraid that you will be left alone with this idea, friends.
It is fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which they tried to Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still bitter about how they treated his family makes a lot less time.
Hmmm..
Perhaps we are more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can be one day a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the usual useless and discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, despite the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians appear to be anchored in its former conflict, everything that surrounds them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left all shattered like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional turmoil.
Perhaps this will make their fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that its lethal deadlock situation could desencallarse.
A war that neither lost nor is
At first glance, the optimism seems now very difficult to justify.
Even if it maintains the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, clashes this week have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will say have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite having killed some of their leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to put an end to Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by its implacable rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas could reach the conclusion that time is working in their favor.
Since the Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. It also has made Qatar, one of the richest states and dynamic in the Gulf.
The jubilant Hamas members say the Islamic crescent is surrounding Israel from Lebanon to the north, where dominates the party-militia Hezbollah, via Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where the Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not take too long to Hamas.
By contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a protagonist who cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will take the opposite conclusion.
As the military issue, have put Hamas on its site.
The Iron Dome anti-missile system from Israel has proven its effectiveness and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more quiet... for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever before; many European countries also blamed Hamas for the latest wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, partly thanks to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to rise despite the fact that, according to international law, are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of an even harder line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why coddle these twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If you really ruled in the West Bank, do not explode rockets as they have done their compatriots in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if raise their heads.
Perhaps impose the hard wing, although the Arab Spring could alter its calculations.
Even if the Islamists take power in Egypt and elsewhere are not too much appreciation to Israel, his priority will be to address the internal difficulties.
Israel's defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
Start a war with the superpower in the area is unlikely to help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
The pragmatic Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the cease-fire is a good omen and could mark the start of something.
Also the Israelis should think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination is creating a powder keg which one day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv.
The crackdown is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as it increases the Arab population.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a boost from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the adopted sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: Two states and the transfer of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which should begin to curb the influx of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside the matter should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in terms of getting to bring Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term failed to submit his own plan for peace.
Back in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote their attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision for the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The law of generic packaging of tobacco enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts with diseases look on packs a green shutdown, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, enters into force and replacing the logos and colors of the brands for a shutdown wrapping an olive green, a horrifying images of body parts with diseases and representations of children and babies sick as children of parents who smoke.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small source.
It is the world's strictest regime applied to the tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia says that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit has glamour.
He was confident that studies show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there is a 99% chance that it never will.
"You can see that children, even from a very early age, they understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said the federal Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls to do the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Despite the fact that Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes do not affect too much to the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said that the law would foster the black market for tobacco, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre, the British American Tobacco, in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that will bring counterfeiters in China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited after the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for silicon covered and among to plug the unpleasant images of the packs had been fired almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha said Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that he was waiting for more stocks.
"For us it is a good business."
According to the experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networking between the demographic sector that is the plan.
After a series of Australian laws that prohibit advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and forcing most vendors not to put cigarettes in sight, the tobacco marketing has gone to be made online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to companies and local Web pages, but cannot restrict it in foreign pages.
"If you comercializas tobacco and only left this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most convincing place in which to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase of reviews on brands from "ordinary people" posted on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if it is just a private citizen who really loves the Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or whether any marketing company is behind all this.
The British American Tobacco Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what it means that the new rules on marketing.
The industry has even gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recusen the new rules; these countries are saying to the World Trade Organization that it is unfairly restricting trade, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant trade volume with Australia.
It is likely that the WTO issued a resolution by mid-2013.
Plibersek said that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering implementing similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce compulsory include images on cigarette packets.
 Currently are compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India is considering applying tougher laws.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
"The pictures I do not affect.
I simply do not case. "
"You take the cigar and guards the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Frankly, there is only one reason that it would stop smoking: For my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the shop King of the Pack in central Sydney, indicates that the packs uniforms make it more difficult to place them on the shelves.
"Normally took an hour in desenvalar a delivery; four late now," says Yu.
"The government should be banned completely tobacco and then, is already, OK, is over and we close the shop," says while raises his hands upwards.
In a world constantly connected, it is not so bad a little bored
During the day's festivities Thanksgiving this year, unexpectedly I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane in which vol√°bamos suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I will not lie.
Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even if you have the means to be entertaining, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.
But there are more and more scholars and experts in child development to praise the virtues of boredom.
According to them, it is right that we and our children, we aburramos from time to time.
Bored forces the brain to look for interesting options and can that encourages creativity.
Given that, at present, most of us are connected to this or that screen, not experienced the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept in good spirits boredom?
Yes.
And not.
But, as we will talk about it later.
In the first place, like many people, meant that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as he says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "boredom: A Lively History" ("The boredom, a lively history") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, that is not the case.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii exist in Latin graffiti on the boredom dating back to the 1st century A.D.
We must also consider how we define the boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in very different ways," says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and raise the idea before a discussion group formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "hope, but not being able to participate in an activity that fills you."
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do so.
He points out that with apathy there is the desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the process of attention, associated with a low mood and a sense that time passes slowly."
The boredom may sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are boring tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or in the world, while the people who are depressed believe that the problem is with them.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, when what happens in reality is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The unengaged Mind: Boredom in Defining Terms of Attention," published in the September edition of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person who read the article in a magazine.
Some groups heard in the adjoining room a television programme to all volume that was not any relationship, others listened with low volume, so that was barely perceptible, while the third group does not heard the audio in no time.
The group that heard the program with low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; cost them concentrate, but they were not sure why and what is attributed to the boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult task or interesting, alteration of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts in a manufacturing line, a music to distract you can help you not get bored."
"In fact, today we know that move or make scribbles, actions which are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, may actually help combat it, because they make that person is physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it is to be bored at some point: The delay of an airplane, a speaker monotonous, a film particularly boring.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To help measure, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "tendency to scale boredom."
The scale covers issues such as "many of the things that I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "there are so many things that interest me that I do not have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to be bored more often than girls, and specifically need more and more varied external stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that is bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which was put in touch with 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teens said that he was bored in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said that when stufato was not in school.
On the other hand, the 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know if the percentages of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what we knew was that "adolescence is a period in which the boredom reaches its highest point," in large part due to the fact that both children and adolescents are not gives them a great control over what they want to do.
So, going back to my question of principle: It is good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, we can make exposing absurd physical risks, such as placing bets or fall in the consumption of substances such as method to combat it, as shown by the investigations.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way the brain to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cooking, that will satisfy you.
But if you see the television, it is possible that you meet in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your child is boring and you give an iPad, it is possible that they are no longer bored, but will not have learned to entertain for himself or dosificarse," says Professor Fenske.
"This capacity and dosificarse applies to other situations," he says.
Your child will not only learn to entertain alone, but they learn to be controlled better in other areas.
I do not think that we really want to praise the boredom.
But we should not be too critical of him.
Our aim should be, rather, to feel comfortable paragraphs of the constant rumor activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need more tiresome issue, but boredom is a wish too distressing and disturbing to connect you with something that is worth," he says.
He points out that what people really want is a way to disconnect and enjoy a long dead.
"In an environment where we are constantly sobreestimulados," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: Without a book of instructions for the new law on marijuana use
Anthony Orozco, 19-year-old student at a community college and footballer of south-eastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal in the state: The possession of a few stones of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke marijuana..
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends led by Lamar, in the plains near the border of Kansas, when the police stopped.
The police found marijuana in the car and a time after Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and related items (lesser crimes that each carry a fine of 100 US dollars) in which he was told the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," said Orozco.
What are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for legalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor causes for drug possession depends less on the law of the location.
Hundreds of lesser crimes for possession of marijuana are impairing both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have ceased to file charges against those over 21 years for possession on a small scale, which will be adopted legally once the law has come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors from more conservative districts in Colorado have pledged to go ahead with the open cases for possession of marijuana and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent open marijuana stores, recently authorized, in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I do not know what will be the next thing," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who are in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also dwelling on the matter.
And are still looking for advice to establish a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all of this before the deadline, on 1 December 2013.
They say that, for better or for worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in terms of the regulation of the use of marijuana, first with therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Commission on alcohol control of the state of Washington.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what might work.
"There is not a real precedent that will serve as a model," he says.
The law of Washington, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, leaving a year during which it nadar√° between two stools, since the licensing system in that state does not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that must be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the demands of the state to offer a "proper" access to marijuana authorized and its ban on conducting business of cannabis within a radius of less than 300 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds for children or children's centers.
"Nowhere will find it more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, a spokesman of the Center for legal cannabis, a research group created recently.
On 21 November, Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, sent an e-mail to its police officers in which they reported that the prosecutor of the city would take action for misdemeanors for possession of marijuana to people over the age of 21 years and that the police would bring charges against such crimes "with immediate effect."
The police chief Oates said that they would enforce the rules of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue pursuing drug dealers and traffickers.
Weld County, in northern Colorado, the District Attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision.
After the vote, said that his office would continue to pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on consumers and they decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to take action against those faults that at the time were a crime," said Mr Buck in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer cites adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, County District Attorney, supported this decision, but it also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession.
"I do not believe that you are wasting time to continue to enforce the law until this change," he said.
Despite the fact that 55 percent of voters supported the measure, was never considered that carry the use of marijuana for recreational use at the heart of the government and the judicial system would be easy.
Conflicting reactions that occur throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials about the great environmental experiment in this state.
"It is a cultural barrier with prosecutors in the district," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendants for possession of marijuana and that is local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the law on marijuana.
"They have spent so much time taking people to court that, in fact, still cannot accept that is legal," he said.
As the first states that they consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the test cases at the national level in terms of the legalization of drugs.
While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, also are very anxious to receive indications of the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Advocates of legalization of marijuana they hope that the Department of Justice will subside.
Although there have been some prominent arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed for the most part that there are selling marijuana business with these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"Although it is likely that the anti-drug agents do not pull down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, probably will be reluctant to allow the operation of shops regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted under the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor of anti-drug policy of the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado are not expected to the federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments adopted moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, despite the fact that it will take about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose took a six-month ban and is likely to approve the next week.
"We do not want to put ourselves in a situation where we are enabling someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the town council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying what voted in favour of the community to vote in favour of what voted the state. "
There are many questions about it.
Petronella Wyatt: "I harassed to Oxford mattress for being a Tory"
It attacks the university students for their views only now
I do not recall any time in my life that has not been dreaming to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my elder brother had been in which I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: Free thinking and tolerance.
However, the two weeks to take my place in the Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the career of History, had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and she broke down in tears.
My friends were puzzled.
The newspaper The Evening Standard said that I had left because they did not tolerated some fellow university kept sexual relations in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I had gone because I were forced to drink in shucked cups.
The truth was less fun.
Hu√≠ there.
Yes I fled, because he had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my bizarre name, nor the fact that came from a private school.
I harassed by a single reason, in the cradle of the alleged illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
You might wonder what this is now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is undergoing a similar persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred towards the students of the conservative party in Oxford is such that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights for homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (grouping of students from grade) of Corpus Christi College say they are "often seriously paragraphs, personally attacked and treated as undesirable persons" for his political ideas.
They want to create a seat on the board of equal opportunities for his college to make sure to be able to express their opinions freely.
Their situation was aided by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The paradise: Young, bright and right-wing) on the policy of students and presented to the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
Was a graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Conservative party at the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a stick with the grip of silver.
In other universities, students conservatives say that they are treated as a "scapegoat" for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20 years and vice president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, declared in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend left in universities.
People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even know each other. "
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a student of history in Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years and elected president of OUCA, says that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are centre-right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the well-being of the members," he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford I was more than a single.
I entered the university in September 1986, was an 18-year-old terribly shy.
Hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former student, a title "honorary" after the cuts in funding from the Higher Education.
The atmosphere would have done shake of Stalinist horror to any.
Even during the first few days of the week to welcome the new university students, when new students are known and know the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected.
I discovered that the professors not only did a blind eye to the mockery that became the conservative university, but participating in it willingly.
The policy of the miners' strike, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came up to the wooden halls of the seminar.
The first thing I attended were translated into English 18th-century French texts and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Not say no.
Pitt, a shallow man with a face that looked like biscuit dough, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Is it that the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or is, quite simply, are stupid?" Asked.
The university other pebbles.
I burned the eyes of tears trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in his free time, as long as it is not too busy knowing people," "Pitt.
I returned to my room like a banshee.
That night I sat alone at dinner time at university; then I felt a slight slap on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he told me kindly.
"I am afraid that this is how it goes the thing.
They get with whatever suspected of being Tory.
For me it is very complicated, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, as well as for you will be even worse.
Many Tories newcomers seeming to be Labour. "
Later, in a local pub, I tried to disguise a cowardly attack.
I emphasised that did not agree with everything that Mrs Thatcher said.
This trick was useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, he said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated. "
Other students took this ditty.
I became the perverted dirty.
"How do have sex the Tories?" Asked one.
"They give a beating each other, isn't it?"
I felt the same way that should have been felt homosexuals before the liberal law in the 1960s.
Could one day lead a normal life in Oxford?
I would be forced to be with people who think like I only after dark?
Does that make me Labour and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that I hoped posed as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only Tory was openly professor Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History aimed at my college.
They hated him for being not only of the Conservative party, but also an adviser to Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches.
There was barely there.
Hated the place for what he considered provincial and insignificant and for its adherence to the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you're not going to be happy," he told me.
I began to travel daily from Oxford to my parents' house in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of metropolitan mindset more open.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
I am not believed.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, it accepted all the political views.
"But if it is the best place in the world," he said with sadness.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dreaming spires.
To my friends communists always had an impeccable attitude. "
His sore eyes began to nublarse.
"Dale another chance.
I am sure that they have done so only to joke.
I would split the heart if they desire. "
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced his credo.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of History had hinted, speaking quite seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red shame on the inside, admit√≠ that my parents I had been "brainwashed" and called them "old stupid."
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was inside nestled fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors duly repented.
When they were made the suitcase and I caught the first train to London.
He never came back.
I call me weak llorona.
But no one 18 years should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only been 14 prime ministers of the Conservative party, but, as of today, nothing is hidden behind a deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to the notoriety."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Couture," which has opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has acknowledged during the opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture," a tremendous retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "house" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with its unmistakable Italian accent.
This show is the pinnacle of a story whose only protagonist is "Il signore" Garavani, but that could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination with the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until next March 3, there are plenty of private letters and photos with the signing of the most prominent of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino taught these personal memories as trophies of their upward mobility: From humble city dressmaker Rabbi, in northern Italy, idol of the "international" jet-set.
To be in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they did not go out of their cigarette butts bonus on your magnificent carpet as they do some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains the "exmujer" Heini Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the notoriety.
And yet, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza nor forget the charisma of the dressmaker.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were 20 people, among which were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decor, food, music, everything looked and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model," which began working with him during the Paris Haute Couture Week, in 1995.
"Never goes out of fashion because their designs are works of art," topped off.
Lineage parade of
Garavani's life is not a history of obsessions, but loves well matched.
He loves to people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk sixty meters long that proposes a change of roles: The visitor takes the place of the models on the catwalk and must parade to contemplate a "dream" audience that looks masterpieces of Valentino, such as the Jackie Kennedy chose to dress for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, costumes that Monica vitti used in "La Notte," or a wool coat and skin that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In that public glitter names like mannequins Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von plane und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario Bulgaria or Habsburg Sofia.
Naty Abascal and dressmaker, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it well.
It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a jacket "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that I did it," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him over others for their femininity, for his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty," added the former Duchess of Fair.
I like the colors that uses, have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriptora Patricia della Giovampaola d 'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time he took a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and was living in Italy, he dreamed of reaching the age and the opportunity to be able to use one of his costumes at night...
Finally, the time at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress for use at a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress, skirt blowing up, "corsage" drapeado and d√©collet√© word of honour.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d 'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives in Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D 'Arenberg keeps his clothes off the dressmaker with "the maximum care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that entails."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller in her wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as he calls the dressmaker his seamstresses) to develop the ivory silk suit with inlaid pearls, twelve different types of lace and a queue of four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialist press, the dress represents a milestone of haute couture from the end of the twentieth century, "the return of the clients of the high society."
For years, which is obsessed with the savoir-being "of the elite, now Valentino is your best exemplary.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates so many honors as any of the spouses of her clients.
"I have always been struck by its refinement, his calm, his appearance spotlessly clean and perfect," acknowledges D 'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was on the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"I was impeccable, time is not for him."
If it says a princess...
The hardest job in the world: The human mules Kawah Ijen
For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano are risking their lives and health loading 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom his work is a hell and another that, literally, works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living making sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To that end, it has to go down each day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies to come into contact with the air.
After booting large rocks of sulfur, which in total come despite some 70 kilograms, carries on two bamboo baskets that burden on his shoulders through rugged stone paths.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2.386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters takes more than 40 minutes to reach a snail's pace, keeping the balance and measuring his steps to tempt them to tune and not fall over the precipice.
They know that any traspi√© could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who despe√±√≥ years ago by the cliffs of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur extracting
Once up, open passage between the tourists that the photograph as if they were circus monkeys, and loading laboriously heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has placed a little below, 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that runs the volcano since 1960, and never better said, its workers, who pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then sells for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to launder the sugar.
"As it is normal load 70 kilos, we made some 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," he explains Anto, who often make three doors a day.
It takes three hours in each and ends up ground, but allow him to raise 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for such inhuman effort, is triple what would win in the field.
"The hire of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," clarifies the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was $75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the proportion was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a good reason that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulphur: "I married with a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughs and irritate the eyes for the toxic gases
His 27 years, Anto carries three playing Kawah Ijen in his skin, whose sulfur has already begun to pass bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
It has asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughs and irritate the eyes for the toxic gases that fires the volcano.
It is the price we must pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a store or studying Spanish or French," promises in a more acceptable than English.
Punished for life, this could be sympathetic and intelligent young tourist guide, a waiter or a hotel receptionist, but instead makes the work of a mule.
Sharing a unclean wooden hut with other carriers, rises every day at two in the morning because the sulphur is flowing at night, when its distinctive blue and yellow becomes shines in the midst of darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto low to the crater alumbr√°ndose with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with their money.
About 400 porters loaded baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and provides no equipment to the porters, who work on their own and so much weight.
In fact, not even being part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge for camera that, along with the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), this natural park rangers charged to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for the beasts and not for the people," protest Madrusin, a burly carrier 42 years Kawah Ijen in three decades, since leaving school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, ensures that abide by working "everything it can" because it needs the money to educate their three children, aged between 18 and 10 years.
I am not jubilar√©, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life
Although the sulphur burning throat and rankles the eyes when the wind suddenly changed and traps the miners in the thick columns coming out of the volcano, are so tough that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, its usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik already can only charge 50 kilograms of its 53 years.
Every day, he and his colleagues start 15 tons of sulphur to the volcano, three trucks to move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away on a path of goats among the weeds.
"I am not jubilar√©, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life," proclaims Unainik opening the mouth, where missing several teeth.
His five children, the largest, 30, also works loading sulfur.
Time passes, but misery passed down from generation to generation, one of the toughest jobs in the world: The making of Kawah Ijen human mules.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the race, stress and the cost of the properties and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my wife patriotic, the fulfilment of our civic duty and we believe life!
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of an announcement of peppermint tablets, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "We will put a Bao (bun) in the oven" to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, offers the hope that with the announcement will draw attention to the problem of a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music for people to "fulfill their national duty."
This is purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducirnos ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue that we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organize parties quick quotes (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why not make the most creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
$1.2 children
That is not take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
Spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage people to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and doles out tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city rich state and high-tech in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to their national division of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as reposici√≥n- rate was in 1976.
So why Singaporeans do not have more children?
As Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, said that it was due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in unmarried, and to delay marriage and the births, which results in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy hat tip to increase dramatically immigration to stand up to the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where abounds barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are critical for maintaining low wages and not be integrated.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the governing party of Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the election, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher taxes and quotas for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to not to build as many small houses.
For example, has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The authority of urban development has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box," which can build in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful sales.
However, there is concern that can promote a lifestyle of unmarried and discourage developers who want to build big houses, family members.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units are depleted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, who before they put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed out
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, to talk with Singaporeans who work in the downtown business district, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, the houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But for me it is important to have my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.
Men and women mentioned his career, stress and the cost of the properties and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to make babies, Singaporeans are those who have the final word.
The private off line is private online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy is the quality of private or "the scope of the private life that it has a right to protect any intrusion."
What is private for a 16-year-old child?
How to apply this definition in their daily lives and social networks?
Can you see the dangers to which it is exposed to air on the Internet situations that surely not share it offline?
ElPeri√≥dico interviewed five boys aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, associated the term "something very mine," on a personal level, and "on the key and user name," when they applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets not would rise to a post," says Jorge, ten years ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it accounts for two years.
"They are very secrets secret, my mom can get to know them, but not all over the world," he says.
In FB go pretty images or games.
I also entretengo with my acquaintances.
"Do not share a picture that is not me, or someone who is doing the ridiculous," he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people, crimes or write comments humiliating or violent.
Jorge ensures meet the 35 friends in FB and its nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is included, holds the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write tweets interesting.
"I don't know if I answer, I just go," he adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends quickly," says.
He does not hesitate to answer that would never accept a request for an unknown person.
Nor would do if someone to recommend to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years, is different.
The teenager has accounts opened in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this latest admits does not meet 20 people added to his list of friends.
"I am not afraid, because we have something in common, music, for example," says.
According to the boy, neither he nor has hinted he has asked for the home address or phone number.
"If I had put pressure or I demanded simply the sack of my account," acknowledges.
Jose became follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy would not are outside the experiences of what is now known as ciberbullying.
An acquaintance of my friend were extorting on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"Never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, not closed the account.
"It only put privacy."
Then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike George, this guy would rise photos of known in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
It would, if I fall ill or I have wanted.
"Although I know that that is ciberbullying," he says.
The key questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English and a degree in Education and Learning, considers that to guide children and adolescents must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to report.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites have changed the rules of the game," says.
Batons points out that the academic Marc Prensky, master's degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book Digital Natives and Immigrant, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are digital immigrants that we need to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He says that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criteria on what should or should not spread, publish or say at an age that maturity does not provide for that."
"Also to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do it does not," he added.
Then, Porras lists some options: There are things that you do not contar√≠as to a stranger, why you do on the Internet?
Or, do you would like to publish a photo of yourself as you have made a friend?
Do you know what the other published on you?
When labels photos of parties, do you have requested permission from the other people to label them?
And one more, do all they need to know what you're doing every time?
Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"One off the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, as should be on social networks," he says.
Surveillance and monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents read thoroughly the policies of social networks.
To understand each snippets they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guard, is key to remind the children the lesson of "do not talk to strangers."
The Unasur summit ends without making public the Declaration of Lima
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without being made public the Declaration of Lima, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven leaders assistants.
EFE tried repeatedly to access the document signed in the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but Foreign Ministry sources and Presidency initially pointed out that they were going to surrender after the closure, but after claimed that at some point will be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
To be consulted by the text, pointed out that the content had been exposed by Peru's president, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information from the summit was restricted at all times.
During the day only aired in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted."
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the governments of the Unasur attending the appointment, though not Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents assistants, which caused the malaise of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more data.
Subsequently, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is Humala's pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III Summit of South American-Arab Countries (ASPA, and on that occasion, despite being required insistently by the press, nor spread also called the Lima Declaration who had previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international events, the Peruvian authorities have worked in that would have insured transmission systems for all journalists but limited to obtaining information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling from the Court of The Hague to settle a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, met during the regional meeting and ratified it will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which starts on Monday in The Hague to hear arguments from both sides, in the process that Lima filed against Santiago.
"We will abide by and run the ruling that defines the differences that today we are taking this international court," said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the treaties and international courts," he added Pi√±era, and greeted with a handshake to Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that will be submitted to the ICJ occurred after Colombia reported this week the Pact of Bogot√° for which had agreed to submit to the failures of the international tribunal, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua who considered seriously wrong.
The summit was conducted with absences from the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended Unasur from 2011 following the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon of Lima.
The trustee read the final document in which reported that were adopted 16 agreements and were fixed lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are extending the agreements on residence."
He reported that promote actions to improve "cooperation in the fight against insecurity and citizen against transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, the internet access at low prices in all corners of South America, and meet jointly and efficiently the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand nustra productive matrix and look forward to a better future for our peoples," he added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and borders... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian president in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two points to a greater connection with Ecuador, but gave no further details.
Similarly, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country for their return to the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded.
Latin America's need to remain as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this sense, Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico in respectful way to treat the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogota.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"We are going to review all these roads, are not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega hope I can tell you that we handle this the most civilized and respectful way possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would be found on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of command of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the ministers of Defense of the bloc previously met to approve the Action Plan of the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of Defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrated UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that "South America, in this case, yes, you must learn from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state-run TV Peru that Europeans "were killed in World War II," and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He defended, in that sense, the project to establish citizenship initiative to encourage the member countries of the Unasur.
"We need to get the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that we want to return to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was, moreover, in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and take into account those who have signed the pact of San Jose on human rights.
Those who give chair never commit to anything and, on the other hand, we all signed the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said in allusion to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa said that he is not repented of that decision because it has not betrayed its principles, but has respected his "profound democratic values and human rights."
He added that, at the time, there was "reasonable suspicion that Assange should be extradited to a third country and did not respect for their process."
He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice to demand that it put on its territory to the interrogation for an alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation allows you to do so by videoconference, which could be done from Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa said that there is a risk that deteriorates the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the president of Ecuador.
There is a danger that deteriorates their physical and mental health for being locked up in a small space, without being able to exercise in the open air.
"This complicates the health of any person," he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a salvaconducto that will allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there had been talks with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We don't negotiate with human rights, that word does not use it in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because the lawyer for Assange, a√±os Garz√≥n, is making a series of procedures in different European authorities," he mentioned.
And opined that "if Britain gives the safe conduct this morning is running out."
And if Sweden, as well as to its legislation and as it has done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in Ecuador's embassy in London or interrogate him via Skype tomorrow is running out this problem.
Correa took to assert itself as a defender of press freedom and explained that what is "does not tolerate mediocrity, the bad faith and lying, which infringe freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians wicked and evil but the bad journalists in terms of profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that regard welcomed that are no longer these journalists "neither bankers nor the bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate in Ecuador," and said it to be re-elected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the way and in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next election, in arguing that the agency "must be firm and does not tolerate opportunism and marbled coups d'etat legality" because in reality "shattered the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president considered, in addition, "perfectly appropriate" to his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now negotiate with Nicaragua maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the moment it is not abide by that ruling.
It is a problem between a South American country and one in Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the willingness to walk together.
You have to process them so wide to overcome them and move on.
It also relied on a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime boundaries that kept in the same court Peru and Chile and opined that "it is right for Latin America seek international bodies if the two countries agree to accept that it is hard to fault."
Referring to the eventuality that were present as a candidate in the next presidential election in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term pointed out that sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa said that if it loses the elections of February 2013 will be removed from public life.
Personally, I was never interested power, but in situations as unfair as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador that can only be correct from political power.
"My movement Montcada 6 believed that it was I who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that liability questions," he said.
To win it would be my last period in the presidency and hence we leave public life.
If we lose equal.
"It is a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Venezuelan Vice President Nicol√°s Maduro and tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, who waited to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"Does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez," he said.
The head of State participated in Lima today at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that ended with calls for greater regional integration to sustain the progress, equality and security.
Deaths from AIDS are now because of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the test: AIDS positive.
"It was as if I dropped a bomb," referring to the recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to do more "suavecito" without apparent success.
The boy hid it to his family.
He decided to take charge of his illness and began to learn about it; with such efforts already celebrated his birthday 43.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients from the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years ago, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, to the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided say goodbye to him "because it brought a cut."
Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of his illness, many people still come when the virus has already caused havoc, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the onset of AIDS in the world, at least for the first cases reported, "the great achievement means at this point that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, it is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring to this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infect√≥logo and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal judgment, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of involvement in the immune system with patients at the start of the diagnosis, with best expectation for those who are not drug users: Up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years ago, when CD4 500 reported.
In simple words, this means that anyone who receives a diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25, under these terms "while remains in control will be able to live without problems to 75 years," explained the interviewee.
For sizing this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While the mortality rate has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS) annual report, it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and van 187 deaths until May this year; however ensures that there is universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
 - Why still deaths?
 - A me, it seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
This view, so we happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had shortages of medicine, the problem is that patients arrive very advanced unknown because his state of infection, or in the late stages of the disease.
He gave a blunt fact: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when you have an opportunistic infection, what needs to be done in order to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, is to make early diagnoses more and, therefore, they have to offer screening tests on a massive scale, to all the people who require."
In its proposal coincide specialists and officials from the State Council AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to be tested by a private laboratory, only motivated because he had done a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the era of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous growth that is one of the most common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some people think that they are going to die and do not want to know anything.
"If I am going to die, the better I reviento three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, I food well, I exercise, I take the drugs.
To date, their parents only know that suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, as anyone.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but shares, I would certainly myself and the other person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their intimacy with Milenio JALISCO to motivate his testimony to those who today, in the framework of the World AIDS Day, they are afraid.
To take the test, whether they had risk, that between quickly know whether they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have a diagnosis, to learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
This, his message, sums up the theme of the AIDS battle this 2012.
The counter condoms
There are large gaps between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist who has taken up the cause Tapatio around HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task effectively "has increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now give us a hundred packages, and that is very good, but it turns out that there are those who today, we still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"What do they want?" Is a common question, with derision and value judgments of social workers, school counsellors, employees of pharmacies and health personnel, who did not want to expose teenagers, assured the communicator.
He proposed to redirect this inefficient allocation; that condoms are not only after the counters and those 100 are in public restrooms dispatchers sites that frequent the young.
It is not encourage promiscuity.
Nor is paying them the chelas and motel, and said the governor Emilio Gonz√°lez, to ask him if he would have distribution of condoms in his administration.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms to those who already are engaged in a sexual activity," he said.
In Jalisco keys
There are 13,435 (12,158 cumulative cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317).
The state is 4 ¬∞ place nationally in new cases and 13 ¬∞ cumulative AIDS and HIV.
92% of the contagion corresponds to the sexually, 6% to the blood and 2% in the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people may be living with HIV because there are registered a case for 4-5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by an appeals court in the United States a judgment that ignores the Group's debt restructuring of Vitro achieved via a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario puts a negative precedent for any company with national ramifications in neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It seems, then, that the procedures in endorsement of survival of the firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes, against the grain of international conventions.
In practical terms, the endorsement of the ruling issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the court of bankruptcies for the northern district of Texas, left helpless to Mexican firms facing the possibility of embargo on their properties in beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.
From the outset, while the trial judge noted that creditors must be governed by the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the appeals court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure is the main commercial competition processed in Mexico.
The first point would imply disregard international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with trans-national profile.
Indeed, towards that end was created the United Nations Model Law for the Distribution Uniformity of the International Commercial Law, acting as an arbitrator the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the ruling establishes that without the vote intercompa√±√≠as, recognized in the critical mass of commercial contest the debts that they had with its array of Vitro subsidiaries, had not been achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility the recognize Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which it accepts the scheme.
There are a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts intercompa√±√≠as endorsed the Federal Institute of Mercantiles contests.
What is certain, moreover, is that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely "vulture funds" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The fact it omits the Court of appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro the difficult situation that faced since 2008 to only glanced at the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, where he received blows the barbs to the country.
For the time being, the signing of the Gonzalez Sada family appealing for reconsideration before the appeals court for the vote comes to full of it, namely the five judges, given that only three voted.
It will not prosper from the Cerciorare resource that requires the review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious case is that the court sidestepped a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Law of contests Mercantiles, pointing out that this case involving with attachment to the conventions signed by both countries to tie it with Chapter 15 of the Act of bankruptcies in the United States.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country surrendered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, that guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Snooker two bands: They Vitro and hit them to the country.
General balance
Dormant for several months complaints placed on the table by the Mexican unions Aviation exdue√±o against the company, Gast√≥n Azc√°rraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Trade Unions already Pilot aviators found the bottleneck.
The analysis led by Carlos D√≠az Ch√°vez Morineau just file a criminal lawsuit against the National Securities and Banking Commission who is accused of obstruction of justice.

The Dragon Mart surround
Meeting over the weekend in a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Canc√∫n.
We are talking about, as you know, a colossal sales and distribution center for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean country's products from the wall, with an area of the match housing for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the Southeast area for opposing the monumental subjects that swept through part of protected areas and raises the mother of all the feints against the industry.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life."
The globe-trotting basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of tabloncillo and, thanks to him, he traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental collection of the history of the local basketball as broad as the "Hetin" has Hector Reyes.
And that is before a stroke he would to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, it was as a player of lesser categories, the National Basketball player, seized and leader in the BSN with Gorchakov of Bayam√≥n or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I wore many hats in basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when he was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," recalled Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora at his home in Bayam√≥n, where lies with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes did not exaggerates when making that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with pictures and memorabilias that denote his long career, prove it.
Bayam√≥n in the heart
In all, which holds more emotion are those who recall their passage through the Vaqueros since the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years serving as coapoderado or seized the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the more I enjoyed it because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Gorchakov championships since 1967, whether as a proxy, coapoderado or leader.
Were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships incurred from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy debut in the BSN.
From there on took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great manager, "said Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "You have a good strong player, 6 '7" tall.
Do you want to? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended to the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativizado and was one of our best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had given him a championship in Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another more.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse he enjoyed, but at a distance, as in 1988 was already in federal supremo.
By that time he preferred to enjoy their records and Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when I won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth place and should have been bronze were it not for the Canadian referee that made us to repeat the final game for the second time, said Reyes.
Is that group of the 1990 World is the best National Team that you've seen?
It is among the best, like the one that we won the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we gave him a by the team from the United States, which was quite similar to the one that we won the bronze in the world.
The team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Picul√≠n" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "To√±ito" Columbus and James Carter young people, to the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 1990s due to a knee injury.
A team that perhaps was not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the Olympic of the 1995 in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and Rolando Hourruitiner youth in place of the suspended players for the mess of the Panamericano de Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that has been Picul√≠n Ortiz.
Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as it did Picul√≠n.
And that's not counting his career in different leagues that played.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?
This is very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
The young people, I love the work of Leo Arill.
What you think your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and at the beginning of the 1990s the BSN took up to 17 teams in a season.
What you was to be done?
There were things that I wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the boys of Ponce played only in your area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now the children travel and play too unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsorias certifications and course for leaders, officials and referees.
That I am pleased.
What do you do now?
As much as I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, disfrutarme my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world-famous for its central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." In the television series "Dallas," in which embodied an unscrupulous businessman, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil magnate J.R. Ewing on the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died on Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer, according to a statement from the family provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas house."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, representing again the iconic role that more like him," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the holiday of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
He was wearing joy to all who knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I extra√±ar√©.
"It was an original and lived life to the fullest," said Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995, he found a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
It interpreted the captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is disrupted when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes it away to live with him at his home.
He was also protagonist of two comedies that were little time in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film roles included well received by critics in "The Group," "Harry and Fool" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the odious gracefully Hagman's J.R. that led to its maximum overdrive.
The the CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The phrase "Who shot J.R.?," designed to generate expectation around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character was nearly murdered, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars in risky gambling houses.
It also helped give the series a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a chapter in November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers watched him and made "Dallas" in the second most watched entertainment program in history, behind the finale of "MASH" in 1983, which took 50 million viewers.
It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. the embaraz√≥ and then threatened to cross it out of prostitute unless it is outside the city, but others also had reason to attack it.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt insatiable with a charismatic smile: A tricky businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), was held.
"I know what I want on the tombstone of J.R.," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say: 'Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing. "
This is the only negotiated that lost.
Chief victory, one of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "enormous, both inside and outside the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us, that we were lucky.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success for the channel TNT.
He had already finished the recording of five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in the process, reported the chain.
There was no immediate statement from Warner or TNT on how to handle the series loss of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when he took in 1931 during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
Tried his luck in the theatrical scenarios in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While I was there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"Do not put anything in there that I thought that would hurt someone or affect them in some way," he told Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant became promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist patients fearful.
"I advise, I value, I meet with them when they come to their surgeries, and then," she said in 1996.
I try to offer some solace, like "fear not, it will be a little uncomfortable for a brief time, but they are going to be fine."
It was also anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start course that explores the "End of the world"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when Professor in religion Stuart charm√© decided to teach a course on the end of the world, I knew I had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, on 21 December, which have clung many people as proof that it is the end of the world.
But charm√© had no idea what was expected in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "deudarmaged√≥n" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists of the end of time they believe that it will start the Apocalypse.
"I realized that this was going to be the semester more apocalyptic that there has been," said charm√© this week to students at Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey).
If you look at what has been happening in the world today, as if we were to 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory, the last of history.
In Temple, the associate professor Barry vacker is giving the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We look at why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way in which offer hypothetical scenarios that guide some human behavior.
If the nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists, for example, could ignite a war.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how compared with real-life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," says vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of the History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, team have done to teach a course, titled simply "The end of the world."
"Do not add '2012' for always having the option to teach the course again, in the event that the world will not end," said Restall.
Despite the "imminent ruin," students should study, generating projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves no other option than to students work "until the same night in which it is assumed that the world ends," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"Became saturated in two hours," said Restall on its course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students.
We receive e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, people who asked if there was still place.
The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to console themselves to themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a student from the race on Religion and Sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a student of the career of Psychology and Nursing, 25, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," she said.
I enjoy.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project tried on the Mayan prophecy and desacreditamos it in a certain way," said Julie Zeglen, a student of last year in Temple, 21 and West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But said that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom of these speculations.
"Elsewhere, people do not think about this," he said.
In mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph were added, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about a course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately on the next date" or philosophizing that on 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period after which will end the world.
Students and teachers are taking lightly the date.
Several said they plan to go to parties "of the end of the world."
"Maybe call some friends to riamos us together," said Samira Ford, 20-year-old communications student.
