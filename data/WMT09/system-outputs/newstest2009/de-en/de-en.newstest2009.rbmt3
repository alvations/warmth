The Prager stock exchange falls against closing time in the deficit. 
After the precipitous rubbish in the morning the Prager stock exchange could correct the losses. 
The transactions with the stocks from? EZ reached almost half of the normal day business. 
The Prager stock exchange attached right at the beginning of the Tuesday shops to the burglary from Monday when it sank by other six percent points. 
This time the reason lay for the burglary with the embankment Street. 
Also in Czechia appears thus the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the finance sector there. 
Case of the stocks in Asia 
The stocks experienced on Tuesday a dramatic case on the stock exchanges in Asia, although the Indices could compensate a part of the losses in the course of the day. 
The index the slope Singing stock exchange in Hong Kong lost nearly four percent points in the course of the commercial day, however, could make up later for a part of the losses, therefore the decline on about 2.5 percent decreased. 
The index the slope Singing China Enterprises which observes the movement of the Chinese stocks on the stock exchange in Hong Kong sank by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed. 
The stocks on the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, nevertheless, reduced then the losses on 4.3 percent. 
The stock exchange in Taiwan sank after the index there by 3.6 percent. 
" The timing for the rescue action in the USA is unsafe and will influence the finance markets worldwide ", according to the boss of the currency authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam. 
Hong Kong determines, although it belongs to China, his currency policy, thus regardless of the Chinese central bank. 
The interest rates in Hong Kong move at the same level like in the United States. 
The American legislators should return according to words of the Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd as fast as possible to the negotiating table and dismiss the draft for a support of the financial system. 
But threatens that also other lands would be concerned by the burglary. 
A bloodbath of American stocks 
The American House of Representatives has rejected on Monday the plan for a support of the financial system, for up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 trillions K?) should be used. 
The legislators ignored thus the request of president George Bush to support the plan. 
According to Bush's view the plan would regulate the basic causes for the financial crisis and help therefore to stabilize the whole economy. 
The American stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important share indexes registered the biggest burglary in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index sank by nearly seven percent, he had registered a similar burglary last in 1987. 
The index had already sunk before the vote, however, barely there was sign for the fact that the draft would not come through in the chamber of deputies, the index experienced a free case. 
Congress does concession: US government may pump 700 billion dollars into the banks 
The uppermost representatives of the American congress and the government of president George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on a financial assistance for the American financial system. 
About that it should be tuned in the beginning of the next week. 
The American legislators reached in conversations about the discharge of a rescue plan in form of a financial assistance for the American financial system in a circumference from 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillions crowns) a breakthrough. 
Indeed, this still signifies no victory. 
The congressional representatives must negotiate since still some details of the arrangement, before they may publish the final version of the law and vote about that. 
The plan to the support of the financial system is negotiated on Monday in the American congress. 
On Sunday the chairperson of the committee said this for bank services and finance services Barney Frank of the agency Reuters. 
In the senate could be tuned according to different information probably at the earliest on Wednesday about the plan. 
According to small farmer a communication about the fact that the plan is dismissed should be the first significant psychological factor for a stimulation of the finance markets. 
Nevertheless, then it comes to a "disillusionment" on account of the complex mechanisms as one could help the markets also in practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
" We have achieved a significant progress. 
We have cleared our different views to how a parcel should look to the stabilization of the market ", said compared with the agency Bloomberg the democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
According to your words it could still come on Sunday for a final vote. 
Representatives of the legislators met on the night of Sunday the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson to lend his final form to the government fund. 
This intends a purchase of mortgage assets unfor sale of the finance societies which overthrow the finance companies in heavy losses and endanger the stability of the whole system. 
" We stand on the edge of a definitive arrangement on a plan which will function and must be also effective at the market. 
One must continue the recovery plan even further, however, I think, we are in the purpose ", according to Paulson. 
A signal for Asia shops 
The global financial crisis is also reflected clearly in the stock markets which strongly sink. 
To the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, according to the legislators try hard to reach still before Sunday in the congress to a final arrangement. 
With it one wants to calm since the investors before shops at the Asian finance markets which lie in the first time zone where a decision of the congress could influence the shops on Monday. 
Up to now, however, is not quite clear yet, when both chambers of the American congress about the law will vote, also lack of clarity rules over whether the negotiations could not fail at the last minute, nevertheless, still because of a problem. 
The legislators hope that it is dismissed during the next days. 
However, the law will still find out some changes. 
For the help to the system certain total should be divided into two parts. 
The initial 350 billion dollars should be provided as fast as possible as president George Bush demanded. 
However, the congress can block the payment of the remaining money if he has the impression that the program does not fulfil his function, namely with other 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars. 
Bush evaluates progress in negotiations positively 
Indeed, the president has a veto power by this decision, indeed, the congress can outvote his veto. 
Nevertheless, in spite of these changes the basic idea of the program has continued which been based on it, finances for the purchase of the bad mortgage securities whose value has liked to attain because hundred thousands of Americans are able no more to pay back her mortgages. 
" We have worked out everything. 
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday about the law, the senate then on Monday ", according to republican senator Judd Gregg. 
With the progress American president Bush also appeared contently. 
His speaker Tony Fratto explained, Bush is contented with the progress of Saturday and " estimates the on both sides endeavours to stabilize our finance markets and to protect our economy ". 
Restriction of golden parachutes 
The chairperson of the bank committee of the senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, allowed to announce, the legislators would have agreed on a responsibility for the monetary program, the protection of the taxpayers before losses, the end of Verg�nstigungen and a schedule for the financing of the plan. 
The new law should also limit the so-called golden parachutes for managers of the societies who are involved in the program and uses a committee upon which the supervision about the fund should be incumbent. 
The Ministry of Finance should lead this. 
" We have worked very hard on it and have reached a big progress in the direction of an arrangement which is functioned and is important for the market and for all Americans ", according to Paulson. 
The plan also counts on a help to house owner which problems have with the repayment of her mortgage. 
The government should negotiate new rates with mortgages which it buys up and the purpose consists in it to lower the monthly costs for the debtors and to allow it to them, to keep her houses. 
Marek: Psychological help 
The suggested plan is after the main small farmer of Patria Finance David Marek a good idea, however, the conversion becomes very difficult. 
" Namely, because one does not know by which mechanism and around which price the problematic assets are bought up. 
This will be decisively for how the finance sector and the government split the losses together ", said Marek this week to the server iHNed.cz. 
Whether the plan is dismissed now or in the beginning of the next week, view is not decisive to Mareks. 
" It is much more importantly, that to itself the congressional representatives on it to some to support the plan and that they dismiss him as fast as possible. 
The psychological meaning of the arrangement about the fact that it comes for a discharge is the most important " at this moment, stressed Marek. 
Duel on knife edge: MP3 player against mobile phones. 
We discuss you by your choice 
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still call up. 
Hence, it looks of course in such a way that it is better to buy itself one phone only. 
In spite of all there are enough reasons for it, why one should get an independent player. 
The choice completely depends on the kind of the use and the claims of the future owner. 
Certainly one with difficulty buys himself for a great expensive record player at home to sound the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc on it. 
Once do not appear such musical novelties on LPs, and from qualitative view there is also no objective reason for it. 
If you have, nevertheless, LPs with kind of rock, jazz or blues in the shelve, probably dream at least of such. 
Thus that is also with the music on traveling, thus with compressed music, simplifies expressed - music in the MP3 format. 
Also here there are price ranges and high-class categories. 
For one it is not maybe satisfactory to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, also a Pink Floyd fan will take earphone for twenty crowns of the market, however, probably with difficulty. 
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everybody. 
The choice is broadly diversified. 
Also the life span of the batteries is vital. 
Some good Music player can play even more than only music, but they not even create that what mobile phones can do by way of a hint. 
No modern device is to be used as universally as the phone. 
Beside the primary functions, the phoning and the ledge, it can return music and videos, both take up, it has sometimes a better, sometimes a worse camera and can also navigate maybe. 
And if one still includes the smart phons and Kommunikatoren, one has almost one small computer in the pocket. 
It is a small miracle, because no fridge can have a barbecue and no television take photos. 
However, the universality of the mobile phones also brings disadvantages with itself. 
The more functions you are of use on your mobile phone, nevertheless, the more often you will have to reload it. 
And playing of music is one of the biggest energy eaters. 
Only few mobile phones can play music longer than ten twelve hours, mostly it is much less. 
In this regard Music player (especially easiest) are much more efficient. 
Therefore, you should calculate with the cheap mobile phones on the fact that they can pass the ball no longer as a few hours of music. 
If you still call up then from time to time, buy yourselves to the security rather one more battery charger for office - this also counts to more expensive devices. 
With MP3-Playern you will not have this problem, also the less good ones stand at least 9 hours uninterrupted company all of a sudden loading. 
Another problem exists when one wants to cover up the music on the mobile phone. 
Unfortunately, only a low part of the devices disposes of an USB end, in addition, every mobile phone cannot be connected without special software directly a PC. 
Of course one can cover up the music directly on a memory medium, however, only few map readers finishes without reduction with the tiny memory maps which are used on mobile phones. 
With Playern you need up to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
They need to feed the device only about USB port on music from your PC. 
Most mobile phones and player put on themselves a music library, regular after the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for instance, the assessment by users. 
Some devices illustrate only the tree structure of the address list, like of Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system). 
Player are lighter to serve, mobile phones can more 
With the choice of a concrete device you should inquire in particular after the life span of the accumulator, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and of course also to the ease of use. 
If music is for you above all a scenery and hear them every day only briefly, for instance, in the streetcar, then reaches any mobile phone which plays MP3 files. 
What can do really already almost every mobile phone. 
They must also not control particularly which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process. 
MP3 create everything, and most music which you get will be just in this format. 
The format belongs to the mostly widespread, and, in addition, most devices can also play music in the WMA format. 
Less usually is AAC (a format, the Apple and his iPods use). 
Better mobile phones likewise allow the purchase of music on-line. 
One needs to call only on mobile Internet the suitable sides of a provider (or another supplier), and already one can acquire a song or album. 
This service can be already actually an apt argument for it, why one should get a music mobile phone. 
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and limits itself mostly only to quick radiohits. 
The prices are not also the lowest ones. 
In general, however, one assumes from the fact that just of such type of the sales of music (it is about GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in future the music industry will control. 
The mobile phone carry most on himself. 
If you have desire to sound something, reach for the mobile phone in the jacket pocket, while the player forget at home lies. 
Nevertheless, it depends on whether you also carry always earphone or at least one wireless handsfree equipment on yourselves. 
If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker over which almost every mobile phone disposes, but only the least MP3 player. 
The probably biggest advantage of the music mobile phones will lie for many in the price. 
The cheapest ones ordinarily cost less than 3,000 crowns. 
For 3000 and 4000 crowns you already get a quite decent Walkman. 
The biggest handicap will be for most that no normal earphones are present. 
The best and technically most mature phones with a 3.5-mm opening for normal earphones cost up to 15,000 crowns. 
The advantage the player lies again in the light service. 
Really everybody can serve the easiest - and not necessarily cheapest (see choice) - player. 
A minimum of functions, the resemblance with the service with the earlier normal cassette recorder or, for instance, the record player is evident. 
No collision threatens in form of incorrectly hired mobile Internet and an afterwards shocking calculation for data transfers. 
For which device one should reach now 
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g., Vodafone 527) dispose as a rule of a slot for interchangeable memory media (type M�, microSD among other things). 
Even if you a corresponding one plays cards postshop, are sufficient 2,000 crowns. 
However, esteem. 
With the base models only maps with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported as a rule. 
Only the most expensive ones can also read 8-GB-memory maps. 
If you already want to own a mobile phone and buy to yourselves still an inexpensive MP3 player, then you reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
Then according to capacity (max. 2 GB) you must lay no more as 1,100 crowns on the table. 
Belong to the more demanding listeners, take rather specified mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent operating buttons for MP3, and the ease of use approaches thus that of a single MP3 player. 
Here farthest Sony is Ericsson whose mobile phones from the series Walkman have the same user's interface like the individually sold MP3 player. 
The same services in the same price range from up to 4,000 crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long accumulator life span (ordinarily 15 hours, at most up to 35 hours) perform MP3 player of the abovementioned manufacturers to you. 
The first virtual supplier already comes this year to Czechia. 
Maybe 
The mobile radio market in Czechia has surely matured, the Czech suppliers offer practically all services how they are also offered by her partners in Western Europe. 
Here, nevertheless, something is absent - a virtual supplier who demands classical for lower prices. 
Maybe this will keep waiting no more long. 
The fact that the Czech mobile radio suppliers work to most expensive in Europe generally, about that we have often enough reported on Mobil.cz. 
This confirmed, by the way, also the telecommunication authority? T � which drew the attention to the fact that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union. 
After the last steps of the European committee in the area of Regulation of the Roaminggeb�hren it comes so probably to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile radio suppliers will be cheaper SMS from abroad than at home. 
How does it come that the prices are so high in Czechia in comparison to Europe? 
The answer is easy, there is no competition which really does a fight announcement. 
Maybe one sounds paradoxical, nevertheless, in Czechia there are three mobile radio nets and a penetration of far more than 100%. 
The mobile radio suppliers get angry against it with pleasure about the fact that there is extremely a lot of competition at the Czech market. 
Pflichtet often also the chairperson of the council of the Czech telecommunication authority (? T �) Pavel Dvo? �k, with which had often expressed in the past that there is no place for an other supplier in Czechia. 
It is probably right that a classical supplier with own net has no more particularly many chances (by the way, he would probably find also hardly frequency). 
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual supplier. 
Just the entry of virtual suppliers on the mobile radio market brought a clear prize lowering with itself to which then also the classical mobile radio suppliers had to react. 
Besides, there were still before the entry of such companies like Tesco mobile or Virgin mobile on the market in Great Britain similar voices like in Czechia. 
However, it has appeared that there is place for such suppliers and that these can be really successful. 
By the way, one does not need to look long for examples. 
In February of this we have reported about the start of virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland. 
In only one half a year this supplier succeeded in winning 100 000 customers more than and in climbing up thus to the 5-greatest supplier of the land. 
Besides, behind Mobilking stands the finance group Penta which owns, among the rest, U:fon in Czechia. 
The advantage of virtual suppliers consists in the fact with the fact that one can concentrate upon a lot of more concrete target group. 
To be able to function actually, virtual suppliers need since much less customers than one classical supplier. 
They need since no relatively high costs for the construction, the company and the entertainment of a mobile net. 
In the world the virtual suppliers distinguish themselves thus ordinarily as a Low Cost companies out - they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS what is accompanied, however, often by a less extensive service offer. 
Thus, for instance, Tesco mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least around half more cheap in than his competitors. 
As, nevertheless, the example of Mobilking points in Poland, it can also be a rather good manoeuvre to place on a not stereotyped target group. 
This supplier is directed since specifically at men. 
" Real guys choose Mobilking - the supplier whom they like and them can trust ", according to David Seibert, the CEO of the mobile entertainment Company, the operator's company of this virtual supplier. 
To say hard whether a similar draft could gain a foothold like in Poland also in Czechia. 
The press agent of Vodafone Miroslav also doubts this? epick �: " The Czech market is for a market segment on which most virtual suppliers are based, relatively small. 
In addition, he is relatively fed from the point of the service offer. " 
In Czechia have no chance, mean the mobile radio suppliers 
However, it is sure almost that if a virtual mobile radio supplier conquers Czechia this will not be Mobilking. 
" Indeed, we talk from an expansion of this successful project, however, in Czechia the negotiations look not particularly hopeful. 
It will come rather for a market entry of Mobilking in other lands of our region ", says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studni? kov�, press agent of the finance group Penta. 
Indirectly she confirmed in such a way that the present mobile radio suppliers are leaned towards in Czechia to this thought not particularly. 
On the contrary, they try to do everything for the fact that no potential competitor originates. 
Their interest in a start of a virtual mobile radio supplier already shows since longer time the group GTS Novera which would like to undertake an other step to become a real competitor of Telef�nica O2 in the area of Corporate client. 
" We have a big interest to offer not only festival net radio, but also mobile radio-telecommunication services to our customers. 
And the earlier, the better. 
We have negotiated about this possibility repeatedly with all Czech mobile radio suppliers. 
With some of them we could already reach negotiations progress ", according to the press agent of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Now maybe there come better times. 
From not official information it arises that the first virtual supplier is maybe to be expected till the end of the year. 
Up to now, however, this is surrounded by an invincible wall of the silence. 
" At this moment we do not assume from the fact that in Czechia place exists for a full virtual supplier. 
The Czech market shows big Spezifika compared with other markets. 
Up to now no subject with a complicated and serious project has appealed to us still in this area ", means in his explanation of Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr? e? from the press department of Telef�nica O2. 
Other suppliers also point to the Spezifik of the Czech market. 
The press agent of T-Mobils Martina Kemrov� adds in rare correspondence with the explanation of O2: " Up to now we have still found no and on both sides advantageous project capable of life on which one could further build. " 
And she adds: " In the net of T-Mobils no virtual supplier will appear till the end of the year. 
At this moment we would already have to be a concrete offer have to be able to think so at short notice. " 
Vodafone directs his attention rather upon the fulfilment of the requirements of own 3G license. 
Miroslav? epick � means about it: " For negotiations with potential virtual suppliers we are open, in particular in the area of Division of costs and infrastructure. 
We look just at this from the point of the customers as the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to the construction of a divided net for quick mobile Internet. " 
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand 
The action of the mobile radio suppliers is light to understand, another supplier would call more competition, this would lead for sinking prices and thereby also to a decline of the profits. 
Why one should make easier to such a competitor the market entry? 
The fact that the suppliers can move in a rope if it is about something, also covers long There and Here around the origin of U:fon. 
The probably strongest pressure in the direction of? T � went out at the moment when U:fon on the market came, from society T-Mobils. 
The publicly accessible information of him also covers this? T � web pages. 
Now, however, just U:fon is suited as an argument, why one should not admit a virtual supplier. 
Martina Kemrov� noted in addition: " The competition sphere of the mobile radio market was recently strengthened, in addition, still by the market entry of the fourth mobile radio supplier. 
Taking into account the character of the mobile radio market in Czech Republic is evident that a new actor would put above all his services high requirements to the market and. " 
However, in view of this approach of the mobile radio suppliers the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulation authorities surprises. 
Besides, it concerns not only the posture of her? T � which does not have the competence in Czech, unfortunately - as opposed to Great Britain and other sophisticated states - to intervene in the economic competition. 
This owns exclusively the office for the protection of the economic competition (� OHS). 
However, this covered his quite typical posture to these whole problems. 
" Then the market entry of a virtual mobile radio supplier would be possible, after it has come for a completion of the contract between a mobile radio supplier and a virtual supplier about the Anmietung of the necessary infrastructure. 
Up to now no such contract was concluded, because the offer of potential prospective customers was likely for the classical suppliers not interesting enough ", thus in his answer to our inquiry Kristi�n Chalupa of the department of outside relations � OHS. 
From representatives of the suppliers such a formulation would not surprise. 
From an authority which the consumer's interests represent and, among the rest, on the fact should pay attention that nobody abuses his position at the market this is more than questionably. 
In particular if Kristi�n Chalupa adds: " Abroad where virtual suppliers work quite normally, is to be observed that her market entry has contributed to a prize lowering with mobile phone services. " 
Probably, however, do not belong the pressure on correct functioning of the market and a prize lowering to the interests � OHS. 
The almost quite moving harmony of three mobile radio suppliers who arises from her reactions is really shocking in this case. 
The question whether it concerns really only a chance is obvious. 
Just as the absolutely same cost of petrol is only a chance and the result of a hard competition with the gas stations certainly. 
" The authority has discovered in this thing no sign which point to an action directed against the competition, and therefore she also has no reason to intervene somehow in the affair. 
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, therefore he also does not have the suitable raised responsibility for his action at the market. 
The regulation authority for telecommunications " also lacks the necessary instruments for an opening of the mobile radio market for virtual suppliers probably, Chalupa stated in his explanation. 
The interpretation of the dominating position at the market is one of many debatable points. 
Of course there is an analysis of the relevant markets, worked out by that? T �, after the telecommunications from the point of the economic competition one single market is. 
Then at such a market none of the Czech mobile radio suppliers holds of course a dominating position. 
However, some legal experts offer another perception - the approval of the net operator is necessary always for the market entry of a virtual supplier. 
And the mobile radio supplier has - logically - for his net the monopoly. 
It means that he takes necessarily a dominating position in a certain segment. 
Even if one does not go along, however, with this argumentation, it should be for � OHS at least a warning that three mobile radio suppliers go forward strikingly similarly. 
Besides, discomfort of a row of prospective customers (including mentioned society GTS Novera) proves that they bump at negotiations with all suppliers into very similar obstacles. 
The shifting of the responsibility on them? Then T � is in the telecommunication services a rather usual trick with which dissociates itself � OHS from the whole affair. 
This was already to be observed in some similar cases. 
Unfortunately, has it not succeeded, in the recently adopted novella of the telecommunication law the extension of the competence? To put through T � on the area of the economic competition in the telecommunications, although a row of experts of it had promised to itself an improvement of the situation. 
The representatives � OHS must know this only much too well, however, probably they have other interests. 
It already goes if nobody looks 
Unnoticed functioning some pseudovirtueller supplier from which there are immediately several in the Czech mobile radio nets remains first of all. 
These are companies which spend own price-lists on mobile telecommunication services which are public, nevertheless, only partly. 
Ordinarily it concerns since the companies which operate in the area of Multilevel-marketing. 
Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others. 
The price-lists of these companies ordinarily reach only to chosen. 
The joke of the thing consists in the fact that the company appears towards the operator as a classical corporate client which orders a large amount in SIM maps. 
Then as an important customer he receives special offers (and other offers). 
The problem consists in the fact that the terms of business of all Czech mobile radio suppliers forbid a similarly disposed resale. 
" Should there be cases which you describe, then it can concern an injury of the contractual conditions with which we will deal then what can lead to an ending of the collaboration with the suitable society ", answered Martina Kemrov� to our question to this problem. 
However, it is rather unlikely that such a thing does not get about with the persons responsible of the mobile radio suppliers. 
In particular in the case of three mentioned companies it can concern thousands of customers. 
Nevertheless, no operator opposes such an action. 
From the activity of these companies profits to be neglected do not run towards them since, at the same time they are not impaired - as opposed to the actual virtual suppliers - by the real official marketing. 
On possible problems does Miroslav? epick � carefully: " The law allows such kinds of speculations, in spite of all the services of these companies are used only by a very low percentage of the customers. 
In addition, these must accept that the SIM map does not run in her phone on her name, they cannot dispose adequately of it like the normal customers of the mobile radio suppliers. " 
Quite only this, however, must go to her? T � seem at least strangely. 
In addition, an other question presents itself for � OHS. 
Do the mobile radio suppliers close the eyes before such an action, why do they balk at a virtual supplier? 
It is to be added that � OHS to the disclosure of such activities has rather strong competence, and if it does not want, it must not itself with the explanation of the suppliers, they would know nothing about it and her terms of business would forbid this, be content. 
When Czechia is the most expensive no more 
As in the text already several times was stressed, the market entry of virtual suppliers brought a clear prize decline with the different services with itself. 
Besides, the classical suppliers have tried practically in all lands where virtual suppliers have originated to prevent origin practically more or less. 
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a too smaller, or too much saturated market, problems with the quality of the services etc. 
In the sophisticated lands, however, intervened just at these moments the regulation organs which tried to protect by no means the interests of the mobile radio suppliers, but of her customers. 
If it is by formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator originated, and other ones followed this. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulation organs throw to themselves the whole case like a hot potato. 
Outgoing from our experiences we cannot rid ourselves of the impression that lack of clarity is favorable in the competence in these cases more than. 
However, we do not throw the gun in the grain. 
If the background information is right and soon a virtual supplier appears, the Czech mobile radio market will start moving maybe soon again. 
If a supplier admits the origin of a virtual mobile radio supplier, will not remain � OHS inactive if it is a matter of (to discriminating to reject other prospective customers. 
And, finally, then the Czechs will call up no more expensive as the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech hymn has four new versions. 
Select the best one 
Sound four versions of the new Czech national anthem. 
On Sunday prime minister Mirek Topol�nek on the occasion of the day of the Czech stateness in a ceremony introduced the new admissions of the national anthem Where my homeland is. 
The hymn became new from the orchestra of the national theater under the direction of Ji? � B? lohl�vek well-functioning. 
Four versions are available - with male or female solo song, in choral version and in an instrumental version. 
The song version took over Kate? ina Kn?? �nkov� and Adam Plachetka. 
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremi�? and Jaroslav Kr? ek. 
On the server iHNed.cz you can immediately listen to all four versions. 
For B? lohl�vek is the Czech national song one of the nicest hymns. 
Already earlier he had said to the Czech broadcasting company, he has selected for the solo variations singer with young, representative voices which are striking and are liked. 
" From the outset I have tried with both and then also with the choir to keep to a clear diction, so that one understands the text well, so that a harmony originates ", according to the conductor. 
The Czech national anthem commits the next year her 175-th jubilee. 
The song Kde domov m? j sounded for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the state theater in the originally Czech piece Fidlova? ka from Josef Kajet�n Tyl, the music came from Franti? ek? kroup. 
It became popular, and the people accepted it spontaneously. 
Then the first stanza of the song became after the origin of Czechoslovakia in 1918 an organic component of the national anthem. 
There remained one of seven state symbols also after the origin of independent Czech Republic. 
How there sounds the "new" hymn

Those which use the Internet sales can forget the issue window in the subway stations really where they had to wait up to now regularly in long queues for her paper tickets. 
They buy the coupon since on Internet, this is struck up on the Opencard in one of thirteen branch places of the town library. 
" At these places a counter with trained staff is also available to the travelers, the prospective customer by the Internet purchase consults and also strikes up the coupon on the map ", according to the speaker of the project Martin Opatrn �. 
Beside the libraries one can be able to strike up the electronic coupons also in self-service machines on the Opencard which are right in some U-Bahn-Vestib�ls. 
How do such machines look? 
They are red, remind of ticket-cancelling machine, the passengers have them maybe already in the subway stations Roztyly, Bud? jovick�, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk� notes. 
" Nowadays there is in the town five of it, however, to end of the year these should be eighty ", Opatrn � adds. 
A machine controls instead of the driver the coupon 
The service of the machines which will function from tomorrow is easy. 
One must introduce only the card with electronic chip, and the before acquired coupon shows off by itself. 
The electronic coupons count from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings. 
Thus in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499 with which above all the inhabitants from municipalities of the region middle Bohemians reach in the capital. 
" In the trains which belong to the Prager integrated traffic the guards have readers with which they can check the period of validity of the coupons after time and zone ", Filip Dr�pal of organization Ropid explains the ticket control. This organization puts together the timetables for the Prager transport services. 
The suburban buses have map readers in the cash with the driver. 
While getting the card with electronic chip must be shown not only with the driver, but the Opencard is to be put on to a marked place at the side of the cash. 
With it controlled the driver the validity of the struck up coupons. 
" If a passenger wants to check the validity of the struck up coupons, nothing is easier, than to ask the driver for this information ", according to Dr�pal. 
A passenger who does not go with suburban buses and knows no more, when the validity of the coupon ends, can go again to the self-service machines where the coupons on the map are struck up. 
Here the information about the validity of his documents on the display of the device is indicated. 
The Sudeten demanded of the USA a popular vote 
The Sudeten-German had requested in 1945 of the affiliation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States. 
This arises from a letter which stores scientific library in the collections of the S�db�hmischen. 
If we cannot be a component of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the patronage of the United States on America. 
With such a wish some groups of Sudeten-German should have turned in 1945 to the US-president. 
Among the rest, this arises from a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and which is kept today in the collections of the S�db�hmischen scientific library. 
The Germans of Krumau ask the American president in the letter, he should permit the return of the "Sudeten region" - on the base of the Munich agreement was taken by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia not. 
" We have properly understood the situation and really want to be sure of the words that the American unities enter German territory not as an Unterdr�cker and enemies, but as a liberator ", one says in a letter which lies with the words " people which the destiny of the Sudeten in hug " is signed. 
Because the connection with Czechoslovakia allows to suppose the Sudeten-German - in knowledge of the Czech national character - that they expected brutality, recklessness, lack of understanding, suppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate over the Bohemian Forest for today and for ever. 
" We cannot believe that you award without taking into consideration the view of a quarter million inhabitants this area a state foreign for us which has suppressed minorities and tries to remove and has contributed purely nothing at all to the victory of the allies ", is to be read in the letter. 
The reason for it, which is why the authors cannot sign, is supposedly the fear of Rachegel�sten of the " Czech Unterdr�cker ". 
If US-president Zweifel looks after in the disposition of the Bohemian Forest-German, it is enough if he initiated a popular vote about in the Bohemian Forest region whether the inhabitants become a part of the USA or wanted to live under the protectorate of the United States. 
Although the text of the letter may sound a little bit naive in today's knowledge of the post-war history, nevertheless, he draws according to opinion of some contemporary witnesses a good picture concerning the expectations at that time of the Sudeten-German. 
Even if the b�hmischen Germans at least had to anticipate that one would negotiate about her deportation from the republic, confessed to himself only few of them such a possibility generally one. 
Some waited that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten. 
Again others believed, they could simply remain in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa who comes from Budweis also confirms them. 
He was used in the war as Budweiser German with the navy on the Baltic Sea. 
When he came at the end of the war to British captivity and one brought him in a prisoner's of war camp to Holstein, dozens other b�hmische Germans came to him, he should teach them Czech. 
" You believed if they came home, the Czech would come to them to fits ", according to Chalupa. 
Nobody to the German prisoner of war who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia calculated to his opinion after on the fact, that one him on the basis of the Bene? decrees from the republic would expel. 
If you do not think - then pays! 
An emotion-loaded campaign is directed at driver 
The most expensive action to the security on the streets in the Czech history. 
Also so the emotion-loaded media campaign which wants to begin the traffic ministry on Wednesday can be characterized. 
The authority of minister Ale?? eb�? ek makes a slip to dissuade driver from dangerous behavior behind the steering wheel. 
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on the radio, in the cinema, on the Internet, but also on Flyern. 
She should dissuade the drivers from too quick driving manner and alcohol at the wheel. 
And they also remember it, before journey beginning anzugurten. 
The campaign wants to talk above all to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least also occupational motorists in the conscience. 
And what is shown in the advertisements? 
Above all the stories of people which appeal to emotions. 
Of it the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also testifies: 
If you do not think - then pays! 
The words " do not think " stand in capital letters on a sign sign. 
And then in a blood puddle there stands the word "pays". 
This should mean that one can pay inattentiveness with own life a moment. 
The advertisements will "shock" the spectators till 2010. 
The ministry can be inspired by similar campaigns in the anglo-saxon lands where one can see quite normally pictures with drastic admissions of accident victims. 
It makes a slip of the fact that thus the accident figures and the number of the road casualty on the Czech streets sink. 
The advertisements were put together by the agency Euro of RSCG. 
Sugar bread and whip for the drivers 
" The motto sugar bread and whip counts to the drivers. 
Sugar bread means that they if they go, for instance, with Red save time. 
Then the whip is the threat of a punishment or an accident. 
The driver must be reminded of the risk ", according to the traffic psychologist of the hospital Well Homolce Martin Ko? �n. 
And, therefore, campaigns of information are necessary in the press and above all negative advertisement, thinks the psychologist. 
Already less actually are of his opinion after boards which draw the attention of the drivers to a danger. 
" Does one put up a static board which warns about a danger, will this soon probably pass with the surroundings, and the drivers will perceive them no more ", thinks Ko? �n. 
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in the exchange for peace 
The chairperson of temporary Israeli government Ehud Olmert has expressed himself for the return practically of all areas which were taken in 1967, thus also the Jordan land, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights if one can close for it peace with Palestine and Syria in the exchange. 
He stressed this in an interview which was printed on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot. 
" We must reach to an arrangement with the Palestinians what means that it becomes necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas if not even everything ", said Olmert compared with the newspaper. 
" We keep a certain percentage of these areas, however, we will have to resign a similarly high percentage (Israeli area) to the Palestinians because there will be no peace without this ", he added. 
He put away that a possible return will also enclose East Jerusalem. 
" That, the security in Jerusalem wants and does not want above all that tractors or bulldozers roll over his legs as it has happened to one of my best friends, will have to renounce a part of Jerusalem ", noted Olmert in allusion on two attacks in the town in July in which several people were killed and dozens persons were injured. 
According to words of the premier it will be necessary to find a " special solution for the Tempelbern and holy and historical places " which lie on the territory of the Old Town. 
" That which wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty about the whole town will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs. 
This will not function ", he further confirmed. 
Deduction of the Golan heights 
Olmert expressed itself for a deduction of Israel of the Golan heights what is to his view after an inalienable condition on the end of a peace treaty with Syria. 
However, this would also require certain strains on the part of from Damascus. 
" My suggestion is not to make peace with Syria solely on the base of a deduction of the Golan heights ", confirmed Olmert. 
" The Syrians know only much too well what they must renounce, to get back the Golan heights. 
They will have to renounce her present respect with Iran; they will have to renounce her respect with the (Shiite) Hizbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support, they grant to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terror network Al-Khaida and the jihad (Holy War) in Iraq ", concretized the prime minister. 
Questions after the accident: Are stewards unlawful in the bus? 
The law does not know them, in a distant coach running around is not permitted 
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the society student Agency near the Italian Padua the question positions itself whether stewards and travelers may during the journey in the bus hin-and herlaufen. 
" If we wanted to keep strictly and formally to the law, the activity of a steward stands in the contradiction to the law about the traffic ", according to the speaker of the traffic ministry Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in which the last week a 22-year-old stewardess died was probably caused by the driver of the LKWs who crossed the way to the bus. 
The young woman sat at this moment to all misfortune beside the driver, on on the least sure place in the car, although she had at disposal another two other places. 
However, a bus can also have at the moment an accident or brake sharply in which the steward delivers coffee or newspapers. 
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped after the vehicle letter also with standing places. 
If this is not planned in the bus, the travelers must sit. 
The distant coaches of student Agency have no standing places; what the manager of the company, Radim Jan? ura, compared with Aktu�ln? .cz confirmed. 
" We have discussed this with the ministry, and this has not agreed first to the movement of travelers. 
Later one has taken back this, and we have reached to a consensus after which the travelers may go during the journey on the toilet if they have her seat ", he informed of his point of view. 
The law knows no steward 
" There is no unequivocal juridical interpretation for the role of a steward - no statutory regulation describes this role. 
However, there is also no statutory regulation which forbids to the Bef�rderer to produce services. 
The law about the traffic knows only the concept Vehicle companion; it does not define his rights and duties, nevertheless, ", the speaker of ministry Hanzelka adds unambiguously. 
The manager of the department of street vehicles of the traffic ministry Josef Pokorn �, however, thinks that the law covers these problems afterwards. 
" It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product licensing. 
Then this is everything ", he stresses. 
Buses divide themselves into town buses where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, close traffic buses with standing places and a higher permissible speed and distant coaches without standing places at the highest allowed speed and seats which are equipped with seat belts. 
As in the airplane, says the expert 
The BESIP expert for road safety Jaroslav Ho? �n sees in the movement of stewards aboard a bus no basic problem. 
" With a liquid driving manner do not threaten many dangers, the situation is comparable with the service aboard an airplane. 
Also here is not sure, when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can knock herself the head. " 
" If a bus brakes, nevertheless, sharply, the laws of physics also count of course. 
Just like in the town bus or in a streetcar. 
The Bef�rderer must clear the security of the stewards by internal regulations ", he says and thinks also that these problems are solved from the point of the law not completely. 
Jan? ura it is ready to stroke the services 
Student Agency offers services of stewards as the only bus company. 
The company occupies about 200 persons in this function. 
The manager looks at her occupation also after the accident not as risk-laden. 
" As soon as I gets, however, the impression that the occupation of the steward is risk-laden, I will stroke him. 
Coffee and newspapers can receive the travelers while getting. 
This would also lower the costs ", he thinks. 
As an interest in the security the manager of Asiana Alexej Litvin founds the absence of stewards in his buses. However, his society pursues only one fraction of lines in comparison to student Agency. 
" We have no stewardesses, we defend ourselves against it right from the start. 
Sooner or later this ends with any deadly accident ", he had expressed before not completely one year for T � den.cz. 
This was an unbelievable tragedy 
In the accident of a line bus to Naples a young stewardess from the region Pilsen which had worked two years for the society had had an accident. 
The Slovenian TRUCK was probably without flashing from the state stripe bent and had obstructed to the bus the journey. 
The driver of the bus tried to make way by a sharp manoeuvre, nevertheless, collided with the right front part with the TRUCK. 
The fact that two places have been sold for the stewards, does Jan deny? ura. 
" These places cannot be reserved with distant connections, they are blocked. " 
Company wants to sue truck driver. 
With a compensation of the family of the young woman the agency will not wait for the court judgment, she expects a financial damage substitute, however, also from sides of the culprit. 
A law change? 
Not by view 
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards aboard a bus could bring a legal regulation on which a 30-headed expert's team of the traffic ministry already works about a year. 
" However, this has still reached to no concrete end. 
Buses also stand not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones in the journey ", according to expert Ho? �n. 
" The traffic ministry looks at the activity of the stewards not as something which could substantially endanger the security of the travelers ", according to Hanzelka and the control of the security of the buses lies in the competence of the police and the industrial safety authorities. 
Dusseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt 
There are enough big words in the letter of the WestLB board of directors to the employees of the house. 
" The central capital market house of the savings banks-finance group " can originate from bringing together of unities of the Dusseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt ten gramms bank, one says in the writing known on Monday. 
The WestLB would introduce a "competence block" with lasting profit strength in such business. 
And generally such a connection can be the determining impulse to other groupings in the land banks sector. 
Thus it reads if a board of directors wants to demonstrate legal capacity in difficult time. 
Since the groggy WestLB stands still under immense pressure. 
Not only to find a future solution on the part of the EU committee, but also by the federal institution for the finance service supervision which has made clear to the nordrhein Westphalian government only a short time ago which urges time. 
From an as usual disposed connection between the ten gramms bank, the savings bank customers because of her investment funds know, and, however, the WestLB is already since some time the speech - also on Frankfurt side. 
Indeed, ten gramms bank boss Franz Waas let with the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August know, in a coalescence of the house in the Mainz country road with a land bank, possibly the Helaba or the WestLB, sees he no sense. 
However, the administrative council the ten gramms which are ever carried half of it by the land banks and the savings bank federations has asked the board of directors to lead conversations about common commercial activities with the WestLB. 
Besides, it could walk away around the capital market business or parts. 
The conversations have, admittedly, one says on the finance place, begun scarcely. 
From the ten gramms bank which counts Frankfurt with her 3000 employees to the more important employers on the finance place is not for the first time the speech if it is about consolidation in the savings bank sector. 
In 2003 it looked a moment long in such a way as if the ten gramms bank with the land bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba can merge. 
Nevertheless, from this three alliance nothing became. 
The plans had barely become public, the Hessian government expressed itself against a participation of the Helaba in it. 
Also both other houses did not find then to each other. 
The land bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went instead of this to the land bank of Baden-Wurttemberg in Stuttgart. 
However, there have been over and over again plays of thought about a connection of the ten gramms bank with land banks. 
Last, however, had expressed itself G�nther Merl, chairman of the board of the Helaba, against plan plays about uniting with his house. 
However, no matter the knowledge seems to mature that moving together the different houses of the public law sector does need. 
After now the election to Landtag is over in Bavaria, a connection of the BayernLB with the land bank of Baden-Wurttemberg could get closer as the first. 
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news. 
Should the pressure rise to other coalescences, the partners go out to her bit by bit for it. 
In the south she would be only a junior partner, although they the financial crisis got through up to now by far better has than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
To one uniting with the west LB again the savings bank federation and giro federation of Hessen Thuringia which is involved with 85 percent in the Helaba at the beginning of the year has pushed forward a bolt. 
If at most the north LB remained. 
However, such geostrategical considerations are only one side. 
On the others it is about the question as the different commercial models of the single houses fit to each other. 
In June Merl, the determining question expressed with which commercial model the future ability of the land banks should be guaranteed, has not been answered by the German savings bank federation and giro federation up to now. 
At the end a decomposition the west LB which is not wished, however, there naturally could also stand. 
Thus is then also in the letter of the board of directors there of it the speech, a "whole solution" is aimed anyway for the house. 
How the unities single with uniting with the ten gramms bank allow to bring under a hat, will still appear. 
The second Wiesnwochenende is known as an "Italian's week-end" 
For Elena it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
However, this time is present Elena as his friend, and thus everything is different, he says. 
Behind them, with the 5-liter beer barrel of the brand of emperors, stands a massively built bearded and proves about 200 October party-travelers, what deep tones his throat can produce. 
Elena gives to Luca only a slap, then a kiss. 
From Bologna they have come after Verona. 
From here, to the bus parking lot beside the railway station Puorta Nuova, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival start in this evening at 23.45 o'clock probably 6.30 o'clock. 
Three buses are left above all to the Italians, in a bus travel excluding Brazilians. 
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans already sing beside her flag, they have already celebrated at night. 
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, this nothing is for Italians. 
The buses belong to Marco who carries a long coat with Pelzimitatfutter and glasses with wide silver hangers. 
For five years they go to the October party, three tours are it only this year. 
At night there, during the day on the Wiesn, at 22.30 o'clock back. 
Would spend the night only unnecessary expenses signify, says Marco. 
The journey costs 75 euros, the Willkommensumtrunk with emperor's beer, brewed faithful to the Bavarian cleanness order, the health insurance and the German-speaking travel management - Marco has visited a linguistic course - including in Frankfurt. 
And the buses already roll at the night, on the Autostrada in the direction of "Brennero". 
There is no beer, not yet. 
It becomes quick quietly in the bus, the travelers sleep. 
Well in such a way, they will still need her forces. 
To salaries becomes in Brixen and in wooden churches where also several other buses with Italian signs insert a break in the highway 8 shortly before Munich once again. 
When Marco's group, in the end, level-according at half past six clock in the early morning on the parking lot near the Theresienwiese comes, stand there already to 50 other buses from whole Europe. 
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds the last address, explains the attack plan. 
First: The yellow little cap put on. 
On it is certain on the left, in fracture, besides the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it". 
Secondly: " If the doors rise to the beer tent, one means to run! ", shouts Marco in the morning. 
" Running! " Take running and the places in the rear part of the tent. 
" Not in front, but we block, and not all yellow caps to the same benches, in the space distribute! " 
The litre of beer, roars Marco, fondled 8.25 euros. 
And do not forget tip. 
" Show to the security people that we well behave! 
As soon as you leave the places, they are away! " 
Thirdly: " Tonight point half past ten again appear here! " Did understand? 
And already it goes to the Wiesn. 
On the way binds to yellow caps as blazes to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a big Bavarian people's party. 
One wants to be armed for the retreat. 
It is the second Wiesnwochenende, known as an "Italian's week-end". 
There is not precise information about figures; the speech is from 50,000 which come along on the way over the Alps and occur in the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors should have arrived on this week-end specially from Italy. 
The Munich police is strengthened by seven policemen from South Tirol, Italian voluntary assistants support the Bavarian Red Cross which leads a nation statistics in which the Italians cover the first place before Briton (about 60 applications) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical care. 
Especially likes with Italians is the Hofbr�uzelt. 
Sleepless nights for believer of the Hypo Real Estate 
The German bank system is relatively stable, stressed federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbr�ck only in pastly week. 
How well that the politician used the word "relatively" and also still twined that the German bank sector is not spared by the crisis-like developments. 
Since now it has entered on the week-end. 
The Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo taken down in the Dax Real Estate (HRE) receives from a syndicate of German banks a billion loan to shelter from the turbulence in the markets. 
A person close with the situation said Reuters on Monday, the loan support amounted on up to 35 billion euros. 
The Hypo Real Estate must pay interest only on the part which it also takes up. 
The money comes from private as well as public law banks. 
A background are losses with the daughter Depfa. 
The Staatsfinanzierer had itself according to a newspaper report for long term projects for which he has lent money, extremely at short notice refinanziert - what is no more possible because of the mistrust in the markets, in the meantime. 
In the first half-year in 2008 the cash reserve of the bank had shrunk about 95 percent on 2.37 million euros, also the company capital rate had easily given from 1.6 to 1.45 percent. 
The running yields and the Nettoertr�ge from finance shops had liked compared with the year before period on zero, had sunk the yields from writings up to demands and certain securities as well as from the resolution of transfers to reserve in the loan business by more than 70 percent on 5 million euros. 
Only thanks to higher yields from allowances of poststored settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as from the allowance of interest after the tax code and from the commercial provision for group enterprise, the profit deficit with about 16 percent still allowed to be moderate. 
The formerly Staatsfinanzierer had itself after his privatisation in 1990 at first with commercial real estate loans verspekuliert which had been separated then in the Aareal bank. 
Because one earned in the classical state financing not enough, then the Depfa had been involved increasingly in infrastructure projects and the financing of communal projects of private investors and the state (Partner-hip, PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. 
Now on the value of the daughter the Hypo Real Estate must carry out the write-offs which will have an " essential material effect " on the profit and loss calculation of the group hotly rather vaguely. 
Fact is that the dividend was stroked. 
Already for 2007 it had been shortened by two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate is a significant state and Infrastrukturfinanzierer since the Depfa takeover. 
She is stronger than other institutes of the Refinanzierung in the interbank market dependent, because she has no customer inserts. 
With the breakdown of American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the grant of credit has dried up under the banks again to a great extent, because the banks hoard her liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs yearly for a part - about 50 billion euros - the loan port folio of the Depfa short-term means to the Refinanzierung. 
After communication of the Hypo Real Estate, the financing need of the group is covered with the loan for foreseeable time and the enterprise is guarded " by the influence of the international monetary markets widely functional-incapable nowadays ". 
From other springs is to be heard that thanks to the money the Refinanzierung would be protected till the end of 2009. 
The HRE chairman of the board Georg Funke explained, against it that the Hypo Real Estate Group the monetary markets for foreseeable time will have to take up no more. 
Central Bank and the federal institution for finance service supervision (BaFin) assume from the fact that now the market ability of the Hypo Real Estate group would be protected. 
This is for stockholders and believers of the bank to hope. 
But in view of the dynamism and imponderabilities of the crisis there is probably no certainty. 
It is not even inconceivable that the financing must not be taken up in full circumference. 
But also the opposite is not auszuschlei�en. 
After on late Sunday evening after report the bank stood still before the insolvency, the at least temporary rescue is also not able to calm the minds. 
The stock course breaks about 75 percent on 3.30 euros. 
Right the loan courses well keep against it. 
If the priority debts last to themselves barely moved point, give way the courses of the postrank-loans more clearly. 
Above all the loans of the earlier daughter's company Wurttemberg Hypo and understandable-wise the terms going out 2009 are concerned. 
To lights Hypo-Real-Estate-Anleihen formerly a speculative investment alternative, their Werthaltigkeit must be looked after the clear increase of the bank crisis and the institute which had got the crisis only in the house, as from the stability of the international financial system with the takeover of the Depfa dependent. 
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less groggy commercial banks are still ready for the support of the system, as long as can be gone out from a fristgem��en erasure of the pensions. 
Or, however, it stamps in this what dares to hope nowadays hardly somebody - that the financial crisis is overcome during the coming 15 months. 
However, in view of the announcements overturning with the partial nationalization only one entitled hope has become from the likelyhood bordering in security nowadays. 
This might prepare above all for Langzeitgl�ubigern some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate from her engagements. 
Short-term investors can use a final line, at least, in addition to form a loss carried forward for the future payment tax payments on course profits of later years. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, should fancy during the first school day in the Tachibana Highschool, the girls catch in to giggle: The German is complete "kawaii"! 
What signifies this? 
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan. 
" The first school day in Japan. 
If I was excited. 
Already before the school way I had jitters. 
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go 40 minutes by the train to the Tachibana Highschool. 
I had to find the way alone, luckily I have not got lost. 
The teaching beginning seems not so strictly agreed in the Tachibana as with us at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils spin from eight o'clock one, to twenty before nine a short discussion round with the teacher begins, ' home room '. 
However, before the lessons began, I was in the row to fancy myself. 
Besides, I am the type which speaks with pleasure before people on top of that before a class of 40 pupils not at all. 
Because I still had no school uniform, I have drawn an old rock of my guest's mother, in addition blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes. 
In this elevator I have positioned myself before the writing desk and have tried to pronounce everything properly: ' Sayonara Wo she Sylvana ... ' - My name is Sylvana, comes from Germany and has in one week of birthday. 
At the moment I was very glad that I had already started a good two years ago learning the language. 
31 girls in the class have whispered everything, have giggled and have waved and repeatedly I have heard the word "Kawaii". 
I knew this already from my Mangas. 
It belongs to the vocabulary important to survival of Japanese girls and signifies ' sweetly, sweetly '. 
Then I am darted fast on my place. 
The girl beside me has grinned quite broadly, she thought an honour that the exchange pupil should sit beside her. 
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, sounded, however, as the gong, I was properly stormed. 
Everything talked all at once and giggled and asked to me holes in the belly - besides, it is really difficult to understand Japanese English. 
Then in the break all her Bentos talked. 
My guest's mother had also done such a lunch box to me - this is sometimes something else than the desolate German break breads. 
I had rice with herbs, small small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. 
Mostly I have no pale light what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
The things look strange and taste absolutely new. 
Firmly stands that everything is really tasty. 
Well, up to the salty inlaid plums maybe, brrrr! 
The Bentos are at Japanese schools not only simply lunch. 
It sometimes happens that a girl gives to a boy a self-prepared Bento which she gets ready then especially skillfully - in hope to get to know the boy with the break snack closer. 
Of it I have read in my Manga comics. 
I am curious sometimes whether I can also observe this here. 
' Why then just Japan? ', my friends have asked me when I told to them that I want to go to school for a year in Tokyo. 
Then I have always said: 
" Because it simply fascinates me. " 
In the end, I already read for many years best Mangas. 
And so that I understand the comics and the culture in it better, I have also started sometime learning a little Japanese. 
For me was absolutely clear that I had to travel sometime here. 
Since I also have a Faible for tradition, customs and customs. 
And one lays on that here big value. 
On the one hand Japan is a land of the newest technologies and trend - on the other side it is austere, disciplines and traditionally. 
And because everything is organized so well, here I have still felt not lost, even if Tokyo is the biggest town which I have ever seen. " 
Also rats have feelings 
A rat or a cockroach flees with danger this is called that it also feels fear? 
Neuro scientist Joseph LeDoux is persuaded: Also a lot of animals have feelings. 
Only how could one check whether do they feel the same if they behave as we? 
In the Internet magazine "Edge" contributions of famous scientists are published since several years. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents well-chosen answers to the question in a series " What do you hold for true without being able to prove it? " 
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without I or somebody could prove, otherwise, this up to now where we not even can prove that other people have consciousness. 
But in this case we may hope at least, because all human brains show the same basic configuration. 
As soon as we turn, nevertheless, other species and cut questions of the feeling or quite in general the consciousness, we enter impassable area because the hardware does not agree. 
If a rat gets in danger, it does the same to how many other animals: She pretends to be dead, flees or attacks. 
People behave similarly from which some scientists on a comparable subjective experience close. 
However, I do not believe in it. 
Two aspects of the cerebral structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience on that of animals. 
On the one hand, the switching circuits almost always related with the human consciousness enclose the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of his participation in the short-term memory and to the execution-/control functions). 
This wide region is developed with the person much higher than with the remaining primates and seems to be absent with other creatures totally. 
At least with those aspects of our consciousness which depend on the prefrontal cortex, under it the knowledge who we are and to plan the ability and to decide reason for the acceptance insists that the person differs even from the other primates. 
An other dramatic characteristic might lie in the linguistic nature of the person: Because such a big part of his experience is connected with language, one often says, the consciousness depends on it. 
In this case one could exclude animals. 
However, even if consciousness would not depend on language, this would influence it indeed, so that procure animal consciousness, how it may also be, would probably make a distinction very much from most of our consciousness states. 
Therefore, it is heavy to determine how consciousness may look to other animals. 
If it can be measured, as something boarder and subjective, neither, nor, analyzed because of the special hardware, with the help of our own experience, his investigation puts us before big problems. 
Most of my executions refer to the contents of the deliberate experience, however, there is besides still an other aspect of the consciousness which might be academically easy accessible. 
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without taking into consideration her contents, and exactly this happens with studies about the short-term memory of primates, in particular at the example of the visualization. 
However, with this beginning which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed one moves himself rather to the neuralen correlatives of the consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical or also not. 
Interestingly this beginning also stresses the meaning of the prefrontal cortex for the realization of the visualization. 
What arises now for the sensations? 
I lead back them on the fact that an emotional system is activated like that to the fear in one of his own activity deliberate brain. 
What we call "fear", is the mental state in which we are, if the activity of the defensive system localized in the brain (or their results, as physical reactions) working memory covers. 
Thus seen sensations are narrowly bound to the regions of the cortex which distinguish to primates and in particular the people. 
To groups with the linguistic nature fine gradations of the feeling arise because we can differentiate states with the help of the words and the grammar and categorize to ascribe them beside ourselves also to others. 
On the other hand, for instance, Antonio Damasio thinks that sensations from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the cortex and the brain trunk arise like Jaak Pankseep which concentrates, nevertheless, more upon the brain trunk. 
Because this network has not changed in the course of the human evolution very much, it can be absolutely involved in type-covering sensations. 
Pure theoretically I cannot contradict him, nevertheless, it holds for unprovable. 
Pankseep argues what appears with rats and people like fear, probably feels also in both cases thus: How, however, can one check whether do rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly? 
A cockroach flees with danger whether also them fear feels? 
In my eyes bare behavioral resemblance can still prove no experience equality. 
Indeed, the neurale comparison helps: Rats and people not even have similar brain trunks, cockroaches against it a brain. 
However, is the brain trunk responsible for sensations? 
And even if one could prove for the person: How wanted one to prove it with rats? 
I believe, that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), sensations have. 
But I would not know how I should prove this. 
And because her sensations presumably differ basically from ours (there the human consciousness on special switching circuits and on language was based), I investigate rather the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats. 
In any case, waves here progress at the neuralen level, provided that one misses the same with rats and people. 
How I do not investigate language and consciousness with rats, nevertheless, thus also sensations, I do not know not whether they exist. 
One may hold that for shortsighted, but I make headway rather, than to run constantly against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist. 
Uefa president Platini: Reprieve for Poland and the Ukraine 
Acting prime minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations were soon put under the direct responsibility by president and prime minister. 
" The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as a trust proof in the Ukraine and her ability to organize the EM together with Poland ", said Wasjunik. 
" However, this is no Amnestie for our land. 
The work has begun scarcely and there is in both lands still a lot to act. " 
In the schedule for the construction or rebuilding of the stages, streets, hotel and airports both hosts limp behind. 
Even the number of the EM stages from eight to six is possibly reduced. 
" We can waste no more time. 
Now we must work with maximum speed ", said Ukrainian federation president Grigorij Surkis. 
" UEFA will keep an eye on us consistently. " 
An even more radical step was decided in Poland. 
The guidance of Polish federation PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals from the national Olympic committee and has been substituted with the independent governor Robert Zawlocki. 
The committee had gathered on inquiry of sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
There is " the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act under the rules ", said Drzewiecki of Polish news agency PAP. 
" We have assured of Uefa president Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation does not suffer for the EM 2012 from it. " 
Several Erstligisten had been condemned only in the past season because of manipulation to the compulsive descent, at short notice, in the end, even the league start had to be shifted. 
Indignant Dennis Quaid strikes back 
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about private - and now has annoyance with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan revealed her ex-friend Dennis Quaid as an adulterer. 
He foams - strikes back and. 
Late rose war with the ex-married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Now seven years after her separation both Hollywood actors deliver an unsightly quarrel with each other - in all general public. 
Meg Ryan had commented in an interview with the US magazine InStyle the last week for the first time to to the reasons for the failure of the marriage: " Dennis was disloyal to me for a long time, and this was very painful. " 
The magnitude of the deception has brought them only after the separation in experience. 
Occasion for the soul striptease was Ryans press work for her new film "The Women - the history of an adultery is told. 
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as a disloyal husband was clear: It is "prodigious, the 54-year-old " New York Daily news " said that " Meg goes on repeatedly the history of our respect and reworks ". 
Besides, it is "unfortunate" that the common 16-year-old son Jack is reminded once more " publicly of pain and the circulations which signify a separation for every child. " 
While Ryan only lives since the separation, Quaid is married again and became recently a father of twins. 
And thus close his Einlassungen with the dig: " My life goes on, in any case. 
I count myself happy that I have a miraculous family which goes it very well. " 
Prices of flight tickets and hotels sink 
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays were cheaper in Europe than in the year before. 
In Germany flights became according to a topical study even up to cheaper by 50 percent. 
Flights and overnight stays at hotels have become more favorable again - this is the result of a study of the travel service provider and finance service provider's American express train. 
The enterprise has analyzed his reservation data from the first half-year in 2008 and after one rising of the prices in the first quarter has ascertained a clear burglary in the second quarter. 
After the prices at the hotel market have risen for years, the overnight stays have already gone down in many places. 
From January to March the prices rose in 41 of 48 examined European towns still by on an average 6.9 percent in comparison to 2007. 
However, from April to June the prices were already lower about 3.6 percent than in the year before. 
The trend in Paris and Rome has been clearest where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than one year before. 
As a cause for it American express train sees the weak dollar rate which has led to a " decreasing travel urge of American tourists ". 
Also finance places are concerned like Frankfurt or London stronger by the decline of the hotel prices than industrial locations like Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Norwegian town the hotel prices with an increase of 26.3 percent hold even the record in Europe. 
Also with the flight prices the trend pointed in the first quarter still upwards: 
Because of the kerosene rise in price travelers had to pay 7.1 percent more than 2007 in the Economy class on an average, fuel-intensive long-distance flights became even up to more expensive at 29.2 percent. 
From April to June the prices of flight tickets of the Economy class sank by on an average 12.5 percent in comparison to the preceding quarter, nevertheless, in the business and First-Class the prize changes were by far lower. 
In Germany the prices broke even stronger one than in other European lands: 
From January to March the prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they sank by 23.6 percent. 
On German domestic flights the prices have even halved themselves according to the study. 
Reason for the steep fall in prices is on the one hand the declining economic growth, explains the enterprise. 
The inquiry in many segments of the flight market crumbles. 
On the other hand, there is by the Open ski agreement which liberalizes the air traffic between the USA and Europe a raised competitive pressure. 
Sign of the tense position is the cancelation of unprofitable distances with Airlines, as well as the high number of the airlines which would have announced in 2008 bankruptcy in the first half-year - only in Europe were of these 24 airlines. 
HSV hits brook Glad 1:0 
With a gate and simple methods become the Hamburg league leaders SV. 
With the Borussia Luhukay does not succeed furthermore in finding a functioning Eleven. 
From Kristoffer Small increase crash landing for national player Marko Marin. 
The Gladbacher came into play only late and failed with a siphon because of the slat. 
His message was formulated exactly, persuasive she went for him over the lips. 
He knew absolutely that he was right. 
" We need the second gate ", Hermann Rieger hissed in the cabin way of the Hamburg arena. 
A lot was not loose in the catacombs, the half time break was finished and most sat again on her places. 
Rieger was nearly three decades a physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a higher respect than some ex-actor. 
And thus his request also found hearing at responsible place. 
Assistance coach Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted in the affirmative the thumb. 
Cornelius is the brother of coach of Hamburg Martin Jol. 
His order will have similarly been: Here with gate two! 
The conversion was missing. 
" Today there everything was not to be looked nicely ", admitted Marcell Jansen later. 
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have wished it " more relaxed ". 
The inhabitants of Hamburg have to owe 1:0 (1:0) to the header hit of Mladen Petric (11).; and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak inhabitants of Hamburg. 
" It was a dirty victory ", Martin Jol summarized. 
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old on this Monday. 
The spectators celebrated on Saturday afternoon already once themselves, the blue sky about the arena and the flash table on the videowall which expelled her association as a class top of the class. 
It will become a birthday without real party. 
" We know how to arrange this ", said Marcell Jansen. 
He anticipates that the tabular end of term report stands more for the unpredictability of the league, than for the dominance of his HSV. 
Indeed, the team with her late obliged accesses - to the Brazilians Neves and Silva, to the goal scorer Petric as well as the Jansen poached by Bavaria FC - is found slowly to shine, however, she is not capable yet. 
" We need more atmosphere and more Dribblings ", demanded Jol.

Dark matter influences flight from space probes 
For many years a mysterious phenomenon provides with brisk for desperation: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing by manoeuvres. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einsteins could not be quite right. 
Nearly 18 years the space probe "Ulysses" flew by the space. 
Now because of soon freezing fuel pipelines the cold's death threatens her. 
Among scientists a mysterious phenomenon provides for many years for confusion - the swing by anomaly. 
The Swing-by is received a flight manoeuvre from space probes, with the swing additional them in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, possibly of the earth. 
The probes can thereby save a lot of fuel. 
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick just as the solar probe Ulysses. 
What surprises the researchers, besides, however, already for many years: The missiles do not behave 100-percent in such a way as one would expect it after the venerable law of gravitation. 
Rather it comes to irregularities in the speed. 
The probes become unexpectedly quick or slower. 
Up to now the physicists could not explain this effect. 
They christened him swing by anomaly. 
Some experts fear that possibly even the general theory of relativity Albert Einsteins which describes the attraction of matter by a bend of the space could not be quite right. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still believes firmly in the fact that Einstein did not wander, and tries to explain the swing by anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter, the astronomers in the universe have put out. 
" Responsibly for the anomaly dark matter could be which could also be completely near the earth ", he writes. 
The space researchers know about the existence of the dark matter only for about ten years. 
An attraction whose effect on other heavenly bodies can be observed goes out from her obviously. 
However, she herself is absolutely invisible, that is she sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, in particular just also no visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists the dark matter well puts out one fifth of the whole mass of the universe, at least. 
In Egypt kidnapped tourists are free 
After ten days in the hand of her kidnappers the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be free again as the Italian Foreign Secretary confirmed. 
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom. 
With a gunfight before the release six hostage's takers should have been killed. 
In the south of Egypt five Germans have been kidnapped. 
Ransom negotiations should already run. 
Over and over again Germans get in the visor of kidnappers. 
WELT describes online the most important cases. 
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently free. 
This reported the Egyptian state television, Arabian TV transmitter Al-Arabija and Italian media correspondently. 
The Italian Foreign Secretary Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reports of Italian television broadcasting station Sky TG 24: " Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released. 
We check just her state of health ", said Frattini. 
Five Germans, five Italians and a Rum�nin as well as her eight Egyptian companions are in good health and in security, reported the Egyptian state television. 
19 participants of a wild expedition should already be on the way to Cairo. 
Unclearly the backgrounds of a gunfight further remain before the release of the hostages: Therefore, the kidnappers have been ready according to an Egyptian security man to the ending of the hijacking, before the Sudanese army killed unexpectedly six of the kidnappers. 
" The problem was solved. 
They agreed with a ransom ", said the official. 
It has been a matter " only of receiving the hostages " when suddenly " this surprise " came. 
Sudanese soldiers had shot on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt six of the kidnappers and had arrested two of them. 
The hostage's takers had demanded of Germany a ransom at the rate of six million euros; the money one of the hostages should be handed over by the German wife. 
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported with reference to a German mediator, the release of the hostages is delayed because the kidnappers feared around her security. 
According to the report the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom. 
The men should be held on as long as, until the kidnappers would have a sure escape route. 
The German message in Cairo rejected a statement to the report. 
Abuse of the stepfather " led to the suicide " 
The many years' abuse by her stepfather has led to the fact that a woman has killed herself, it was reported to a court. 
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received an imprisonment from six years, after he had stood eight cases of sexual abuse. 
The penal court of law in Truro found out that he his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle tied up regularly as them between five and seven years as was. 
Trerise wrote in a confession: " I feel responsibly for her death. " 
The court found out that Mrs. Randle killed herself in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on the 1st April, 2007 at the age of 34. 
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had tied up them and had connected her eyes before he sexual actions carried out, while her mother was away around by a restaurant to work. 
Trerise and his woman separated in the 1980th and he moved back to Cornwall. 
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth. 
Nevertheless, the court found out that Mrs. Randle who worked a big part of her time in an honorary capacity for the Nationwide trust was pursued by the abuse which had been added her two times per week. 
Public prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said, that Mrs. Randle who had been a keen surfer and cyclist, has been since 2006 " emotionally deadly " and would have " her life given up " 
In April, 2007 her right father Terrance Randle found them deadly in her apartment in Plymouth. 
One supposes that she has killed herself while itself herself by means of a plastic bag has suffocated. 
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter who wrote a confession letter which ended so: " I was in habit to tie up them and to connect her eyes. " 
" I have not urged them sexually. 
I feel responsible for her death. " 
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: " You are an extremely strange Fetischist and for her victim it must have been horrific, in particular because she was only seven. 
This joyless history ends with the suicide of the victim. 
Still the fact is more badly that it is very unlikely that the affair would be ended in court if she had not done this. " 
He added: " I take which consequences to the knowledge, according to description of Stephanies father and mother, her action about the years on her daughter had. 
She would have been otherwise unambiguously a promising, successful and happy young woman. " 
For lost data responsible official it is accused 
The BBC has found out, that the cabinet official who had lost in June strictly confidential documents in a train according to which " public security law " will be accused. 
The man was delegated by the ministry of defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo. 
The documents were handed over to the BBC, before they were handed over to the police. 
It is the weakest accusation within the law and there is no tip to criminal intention. 
BBC defensive correspondent Frank Gardner said the action if a surprise has been for many in Whitehall. 
He said: " You would have thought that would be put itself apart with it inside with the ministry of defense and cabinet. " 
The employee whose name cannot be called is accused according to sales 8.1 of the law, the clause which deals with the sure safekeeping of information. 
The royal public prosecutor's office recommended that the official should be accused by the Metropolitan police because of the extremely sensitive nature of his work in the common Geheimdienstkommitee. 
The documents which he moved contained classed assessments about Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces. 
He was informed about the decision on the Monday morning and was brought by his house to a kept secret place. 
House building societies see B*B costs in the eye 
To British house building societies costs of more than 80 million pounds could stand after the rescue the Bradford and Bingley bank in the house. 
The government made available 14 billion pounds to protect the inserts of Bradford and Bingleys 2.6 million customers. 
The interest for this advance is paid by all enterprises which get money of investors, including 59 building companies 
The general manager of the union of the house building societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said, it is "intolerable" that the societies and her members would have to pay. 
At last the 14 billion advances will be paid back if Bradford and Bingleys loans are erased. 
But the interest accumulated in the interim is credited every year to those 700 finance enterprises which accept payments. 
The program to the compensation of finance services confirmed compared with the BBC that 59 house building societies are included in this number. 
It is bitter that those institutions which have behaved prudently ... now are called on around some for taking over of the costs of those institutions which were less circumspect by far. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
It said that every enterprise had to pay in proportion to the inserts which it would hold, and that the societies would have to pay together about 18% of the costs. 
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest is amounted themselves for the loan to 450 million pounds in 2009. 
That is the fact that the societies must procure 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, the general manager of the union of the house building societies, informed the BBC that he believes that this is unfair. 
It is bitter that those institutions which have behaved prudently during the real estate impetus now are called on some for carrying of the costs of those institutions which were less circumspect by far. 
According to the BSA no society has failed since the existence of the recordings in 1945. 
" We will observe all aspects of this thing about the next weeks to see which alternatives there are to protect house building societies and her members of possibly considerable costs. " 
The interest which becomes due in 2009 covers seven months from end of September this year till the end of March. 
In 2010 interest for a full year becomes due and for this could be nearly twice as much. 
Because building companies are on both sides organizations without companions, her members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts. 
Milk becomes five pence per liter more expensive 
The people on Jersey feel confronted to have to pay more for her milk. 
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the majority market price of his milk to other five pence per liter from Monday. 
It is the second rise in prices this year, after two pence rise in February, and comes, after investigations of a consulting firm were carried out. 
The retail dealers should decide themselves whether they liked to transmit the price increase to her customers. 
Last before the price increase in February the majority market price of Jersey milk changed in 2002. 
Security is kept former prime minister of Bangladesch 
A court in Bangladesch has rejected a security request of the former prime minister sheikh Hasina what means that it could be arrested if she returns in the land. 
Their defenders said that the court security refused concerning the accusation 50 millions Taka (729,700 $) from a businessman to have blackmailed, while she was a prime minister. 
The case is one of several floating accusations because of corruption against them. 
Sheikh Hasinas more for many years political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released beginning this month on security. 
Sheikh Hasina should return during the next weeks to Bangladesch, but her party, the Awami alliance, demanded that the military-supported caretaker government should grant her freedom unlimited once at first. 
The correspondents say that, although her like suspension was granted around for medical treatment abroad to go it is not clear within the scope of her release whether she is able to remain further at large if she returns to Bangladesch. 
Their lawyers give that she appeals now to the uppermost court of law against the decision of the upper court. 
" The upper court has rejected sheikh Hasinas Kautionsbitte because it says that she must get no security granted, because she is already on like suspension abroad to be treated abroad ", said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq. 
We will announce an appeal against the upper court. " 
Their lawyers argue that she security needs to return from abroad in the land to prepare for the choices in December. 
It is expected that sheikh Hasina will return after the 17th October home, an Awami alliance-party leader said on Sunday. 
It was arrested the last year after the army-supported caretaker government had taken over the power, however, had been dismissed in June from the prison to go abroad for medical treatments. 
All charges deny sheikh Hasina, as well as Khaleda Zia, against themselves. 
Fears around the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan 
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan nearly 200,000 children have not been inoculated on account of the power which is associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations. 
The United Nations have carried out the last week in six provinces a vaccination program. 
However, they could not reach children in parts from Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons. 
According to a speaker of UN this was the case in spite of the promise of the Taliban not to attack the thousands the vaccinations carrying out employee or to hinder. 
BskyB loses complaint in the case ITV 
BskyB has lost his complaint against the decision of the competitive committee to reduce his interest in to competing transmitter ITV. 
The competitive court of appeal has prescribed BskyB to reduce his participation in ITV of 17.9% on less than 7.5%. 
Before the committee had stated, the interest BskyBs distorts the competition and allows an unfair influence on transmitter ITV to him. 
BskyB has acquired his interest in 2006, while he has hindered NTL, renamed now in Virgin Media, successfully in the purchase of ITV. 
In April, 2007 the competitive authority has reported, the purchase of the interest in ITV by BskyB ready doubts about the independence of the ITV what has moved the competitive committee in addition, an investigation to begin. 
The Virgin boss sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communication velvet Ofcom have expressed themselves against the purchase. 
BskyB argued, the pressure his interest in ITV to reduce, is an unreasonable and excessive measure, in particular because BskyB had announced to want to give up his rights to vote. 
New investigation in the US American public prosecutor affair 
The American Chief State Prosecutor has asked a special investigator to deal with the notice of nine public prosecutors in the USA in 2006. 
The occasion was a report of the general inspector of the Ministry of Justice in which the actions of the administration employees were criticized. 
The report practiced criticism of the officials of the White House, to legislators and the former Chief State Prosecutor Alberto Gonzales. 
The investigation was driven by the fears, the lawyers have been set down for political reasons. 
Now the special investigator Nora Dannehy should clear whether the officials interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators to hinder the justice. 
Serious reproaches including criminal action do not have been examined completely or have been cleared, said to the general inspector Glenn Fine in his report. 
The appeal of a special investigator with the competence to force the witnesses to the statement was one of his main recommendations. 
The conflict began as the Ministry of Justice in December, 2006 nine the US public prosecutors of her offices relieved. 
At that time there argued the ministry, the public prosecutors would dismiss on account of weak working achievements. 
However, one found out later that the dismissed public prosecutors worse than many of her Kollegenbe does not judge had become, what many observers in addition veranlasste to look at the notices as political motivated. 
Some of these public prosecutors were included in the judicial pursuit of high-ranking republican Members of Congress, while others had refused to examine the reproaches about electoral fraud of the democrats. 
The US American public prosecutors are asked to examine judicial cases for the government and to pursue. 
They can dismiss any time, nevertheless, may not be set down for political reasons. 
The leader at that time of the Ministry of Justice Chief State Prosecutor Alberto Gonzales has come under fire because of the dismissals and has in the final effect his office lays down. 
A row of officials of the Ministry of Justice have likewise given notice. 
The report of the general inspector has appealed in particular to the role of Gonzales critically, while he would have carried the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, "would have "given up" his guide roller and would have appeared in the process " extremely uninterestedly " 
Other official, under it also the former main adviser president Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the defective cooperation with the investigators.

The chief editor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said, there would be some songs which go out such matters like time and genre and " Asked Out Of Brightly " one is absolutely of it. 
The song that was written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice which was delivered by Meat Loaf. 
It begins with an instrumental part which lasts nearly two minutes. 
The song has appeared in Great Britain single in 1979 in the sales and has reached place 15 in the charts. 
However, Meat Loafs " Asked has spent Out Of Brightly " about nine years in the charts and has sold worldwide more than 40 millions times. 
Meat Loaf whose true name Marvin Lee Aday is has suffered during the last years from serious health problems. Under it an operation was in 2003 because of irregul�ren heartbeat, after he had broken down on the stage. 
In 2007 he had to call off on account of an acute laryngitis concerts. 
Later became known that he had a cyst in his vocal chord. 
Obscure street in town forget often and, perhaps, soon to sell 
New York city has thousands of main thoroughfares, avenues, side routes and other by-pass roads from what some are famous and only comfortable other. 
Still it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing local to say where extra Place is, simply because most have never belonged of it. 
This tiny street is in the East Village and runs from the ridge Street in the direction of north between Bowery and Second avenue without reaching the Second Street. 
She is wide 30 feet and 120 feet long and looks rather after a dusty lane than after actively used Durchfahrtstrasse. 
There are also no street signs. 
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard-street plan. 
This street still has her admirers. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a building contractor which has recently established luxurious buildings on the ridge Street. 
It wants to pave extra Place anew, around a clean way through to the stores and boutiques which are expected in the new buildings to create. 
To the other admirers belongs the long-standing neighborhood which says, she is entrancedly from the short lane, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the block of houses. 
However, the city administration department which is responsible for protection and establishment of the residential buildings and for which street is responsible has no interest to receive them. 
During a meeting of the committee for land use of the district council this month representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have sketched a suggestion for the purchase of the street for the building contractor. 
Still prefers the committee that the street remains in the hands of the town, and has asked for a new plan which should be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district person responsible in the district council 3. 
" Only very little space has remained in the possession of the town and we might that extra Place has belonged furthermore to the town ", she said. 
" There could be offers how one repairs the street and pursues what could be done by Avalon, however, we also want that the public access remains guaranteed. " 
Avalon Bay has announced some months ago which pave small street anew and furnish seats which are intended, among the rest, for a caf� in which the enterprise would like to rent space. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month. 
Michele de Milly, a speaker of the Avalon Bay, said that, indeed, the enterprise wanted to use the street, it wants not necessarily to own them, however. 
" The preoccupation of the Avalon Bay is to be renovated it this dilapidated lane and to do a public meeting place ", she said and added that the town itself had suggested the sales. 
Seth Donlin, speaker of the department for building protection meant, it has really been the wish of the town to sell the street and stressed, the task of the department is to be developed it rather the real estates than to administer. 
Compared to his colored neighborhood The Bowery, extra Place has maintained somewhat of his historical impression. 
Some believe that the street has got her name in 1802, as a big farm which belonged Philip Minthorne was split between his numerous children and a narrow stripe land was claimed by nobody. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument which was closed in 2006 opened to the extra Place and the street is known certainly mostly as a scenery for the photo on the cover of the album " Rock to Russia " by Ramones. 
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who had done the photo in November, 1976. 
The street was full of scrap metal, rags and parts of barrels, posters, sheets and ropes. 
Some inhabitants, including the Blogger who write about the Gentrifizierung of the East Village have rejected the idea of the sales of extra Place, with the argument that this public property as give as it is, should remain furthermore public. 
Other have praised extra Place than one rarity? a practically unchanged splinter of the town which should be left alone. 
Jeremiah Moss who pursues the Blog called " Jeremiahs evanescent New York " (subtitled with the " book of the complaints: A bitter nostalgic look at the becoming extinct town "), has published a part of the conversation of the town history about extra Place which had appeared in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952. 
At that time the author, Brendan Gill, has written: " Specially Place is a small narrow dead end which remains dark even during the day and is marked by rusted Metallt�re of the warehouses, close windows and along rain channels flying weekly-old newspapers ". 
With few exceptions the street has looked just recently in an evening. 
A rat ran by the rear part of the street, not far from the door which led earlier to the CBGB where today a more expensive clothes business is. 
Graffiti were to be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay not far on the ground from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers. 
Some passers-by said, they would seldom have thought about extra Place, however, suggested that the street could be polished up a little bit. 
Fields, added that according to his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the street in her topical state. 
The prime of life of my life, he said, were dark in the places humid which and were revolting. 
Debate around bilingual education: Education in English-speaking surroundings 
In this issue of "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates to the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific employee in Kalifonischen studies and leading manager in the department of Educational sciences in the Pacific Research institute for Public Policy, is not a co-author of the book " virtually one thinks: Why the middle class needs a school choice ". 
To appeal to the B sharp-panic voters is a complex task. 
Barrack Obamas suggestions on the subject Education are a typical example of it. 
Obamas electoral campaign mentions to conclude successfully the likelyhood with afro American and B sharp-panic pupils the school ", is lower, than with white pupils " - what is right. 
To close this achievement distance, Obamas educational plan especially under the others recommends a bilingual transitional phase in the education for those which only learn English. 
The question to Obama still consists in the fact whether his application contradicts for the bilingual education which lays the main focus on lessons into other languages than English his interest to reduce the distance in the school achievements. 
If we take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles. 
The majority of the pupils are B sharp-panic and come from families with low income. 
More than a third of the pupils from which many are only recently in the land learn English. 
Astonishing 100 percent of pupils of the fourth class have still passed in 2008 the state check in math at a good level. 
Likewise unexpectedly 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were valued in the English check as good. 
This astonishing success was reached with other methods, than those which are preferred by Obama. 
School Sixth Street lays her main focus on examination and practise, on steady control of the knowledge and a posture which tolerates no exceptions. 
Besides the school carries out the beginning after which the education runs in English-speaking surroundings. Exactly this is the point which Obama should follow, according to the head mistress Linda Mikels. 
This beginning lays value on the almost exclusive use of the English language in the professional lessons. 
Mrs. Mikels who rejects the idea of bilingual education said to me, the school would have a noteworthy success with a pupil who had come only briefly before it from Mexico. 12 months later one would enter the classroom and can recognize him no more. 
" It functions ", she marked, " it functions for us ". 
Dignity Obama a school like "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with big interest in Latin-American and other English from learning pupils take? 
The achievements of the school would make easy the answer to this question, however, the educational positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time the idea of bilingual education) and his own logical support of the bilingual education do predictions about Obamas answer uncertainly. 
While he agrees to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently has the subject trivialisiert, while he marked that people should stop, itself worries about on " only English " aiming legislation do. 
Instead, he said: " You should make sure that your child can do Spanish ". 
If Obama wants to close the achievement distance really, he should take into consideration carefully educational models which function instead of despising them and to trivialisieren. 
The oil price sinks as a result of renewed fears by the economy 
The oil price is on Monday on account of the fears that even the American rescue plan could not pass for the finance markets the economy again to animate, strongly like. 
The crude oil option dealings on the New York commercial stock exchange have liked in the morning session about 7 percent on 99.80 $ per barrel. 
Since the last Monday the price has sunk by more than 20 $. 
During the last two weeks the good markets have been shaken by the finance turbulence in the embankment Street and as well as by strong cyclones in the gulf of Mexico. 
After the prices had reached her climax from 145.29 $ per barrel in July, they have liked this month on almost 90 $ per barrel to rise then again, as a result of the huge uncertainty in the finance markets. 
On Monday investors have been concerned again, although congressional representatives had announced, they would have agreed on the week-end on a rescue plan which should be biggest in the history. 
This news was overshadowed by new worries that the financial crisis would not be still concluded by far. 
In the chapter last for the time being of the growing crisis, should go, according to a government communication on Monday which Citigroup the banking transactions of the Wachovia corporation buy up. 
In the meantime Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourgian governments have partially nationalized European finance group Fortis. 
After analysts with Barclays Capital, it is in spite of the tense negotiations which have taken place on the week-end and have led to a rescue plan to animate apparently not successfully, the mood at the markets. 
Because the economic situation gets further worse, is to be expected that the inquiry for goods, will further sink, among the rest, after oil. 
Analysts of German bank have written in a communication of investors, the predictions for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain. 
We believe, they further write that the good markets are likewise concerned. 
" From the perspective of the good markets we are procured mostly about whether of the US American virus spreads out worldwide, in particular to China. " 
The analysts of the bank have corrected her expectations for the oil consumption on account of the weak economic growth for the next year down, and have lowered her predictions for the oil price and gas price of 2009 about 20%. 
Team's record by series in the second quarter aufgestellr 
Inside defender Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything, after he accumulated during the last 8,5 years more often than every other in the jet tricot. 
Then he saw on Sunday the second quarter in which the jets transformed an unsuccessful play into a triumphal procession. 
" I have never seen such a thing ", said Ellis. 
After a sloppy play between the jets and Arizona Cardinals which corresponded to the bad weather the second quarter began. 
When nevertheless Quarterback board Favres passport came with Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, that marked the perfect prelude to an afternoon in her developing collaboration a giant stride forwards did. 
Favre found Coles in this quarter for another two touchdowns which slipped sometimes as a full-back and other sometimes 10 seconds before the end of the half time. 
" I have not especially exerted myself ", says Coles about the passports to Coles went. 
" He is a superplayer. 
Our vote has been right, all the same what the people think. " 
While Favre and Coles catch played, the defense Quarterback Kurt Warner took apart. 
Full-back Darrelle Revis intercepted an unsuccessful throw and transformed him into a 32-yard touchdown. 
Sweeper Erik Smith came to another passport and intercepted him. 
Then Linebacker David Bowens provided for a loss of alerter. 
The last ball loss, enforced with Bowens, was probably the most mad one. 
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with another 10 seconds, for the rest, in the play as the jets the ball recaptured and Jay Feely 20 yards shot to 34 to 0 guidances transformed. 
These were most points the jets one day in a quarter had achieved. 
When he was asked the insanity to describe answered Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets " the second quarter or the third quarter? " 
On the answering both, because the jets 21 points left in the third quarter to without just one to achieve, said Mangini: " Believe me, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third one. 
An amount of points were achieved in short time. " 
Rested Gebrselassie hits his world record 
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has pointed again, why him some hold for the best long-distance runner of all times, after he has broken his own record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and has become the first person who has created the distance of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes. 
With the victory on the level course in 2:03:59 Gebrselassie his has improved the previous result from 2:04:26 about 27 seconds which he had reached the last year in Berlin. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has with it his 26 world record in his many-sided career puts up in which he has reached at least one world championship title on every distance from a kilometer up to the marathon or has put up a world record. 
The last month Gebrselassie has let out the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because of fear which was maybe exaggerated in the Nachhinein that the air pollution could aggravate his asthma problems. 
Instead, he has announced himself for the competition in Berlin. 
In almost ideal conditions - with the sun and 9 degrees in the start and 13 degrees in the purpose - Gebrselassie at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile has won. 
Since road runners have changed like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya on long distances, the record time is for marathon during the last 10 years has liked around more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo has won there Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05. 
After his victory on Sunday Gebrselassie of the press has informed, he would have had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and, therefore, could not train one week. 
Obviously he is refreshed after break and not rusty come back. 
" I am so happy ", he said to reporters. 
" Everything has run perfectly. 
I have taken up the training one week ago again and had even today some doubts, however, at the end what everything really. " 
He was criticized for it - in particular in Kenya, rivals of Ethiopia from East Africa - that he orchestrates his racing runs excessively many world-best marathon stars avoids in general, counts too much on the racing leaders, as if that was a road running, and it puts world records about the competition. 
However, this criticism barely damages to the size Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner. 
Accompanied by four Kenioians on Sunday Gebrselassie had reached the center of the distance in 1:02:04. 
Two �lite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have Gebrselassie furthermore challenges, after the tempo doers had decreased. 
A little bit more than three miles before the finish Gebrselassie has done his last beginning to separate from Kwambai which has come as second in 2:05:36 and has improved with it his best time about nearly 5 minutes. 
Kamathi became a third in 2:07:48. 
With women has concluded Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, a substantial year, while she has pointed with the 2:19:19 seventh-quickest result of all times. 
The world record from 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain. 
In the last spring the 36 years old Mikitenko had won unexpectedly the London marathon in 2:24:14. 
She has missed the plays in Beijing, because of problems which became as a back injury to described ones. However, she has recovered to win in Berlin and to improve her best time in her third marathon about five minutes. 
She has planned her run cleverly, while it allowed to only tear out a quartet from Ethiopian and Kenyan runners, but overtaken after 30 kilometers. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became seconds in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came as third in 2:25:01. 
The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, in a town of the quite special kind 
Hidden between the outgrowths of the leisure parks in the vicinity of Orlando, few miles away from the glittering, loud and huge activity, there lies a quiet town in which the pride and the complications of the Afro American culture appear. 
Eatonville, the first totally black town in the land and the hometown Zora Neale Hurstons, is as easy no more to describe as Hurston it in 1935 did: " the town with 5 lakes, three Krocketpl�tzen, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison. " 
Nowadays it is a pilgrim's site. 
Alice Walker, tones Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! To think festival in Eatonville come around the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And still is and does remain the town which she describes? and she did a tourist destination, while it took up them in Florida guide who was produced at the times of the depression by the federal author project? in many respects a place of the quite special kind. 
Eatonville is so independent, good-quality and private like in the 1930th when Hurston wrote that rural black municipalities in Florida often refused to divide her true thoughts with the white man who knows " so little about us that he does not know what to him escapes. " 
Even nowadays, in one year in him a black Pr�sidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, for an open conversation about race relations appeals, these are many here furthermore suffer from being observed by outsiders. 
" We are anxious very much of it like our history is told ", according to Hortense Jones, 59, from birth an inhabitant of the town and parishioner of the oldest church of the town. 
It must be right. " 
Eatonville was defined for a long time as a paradox of the triumph and the fight. 
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a municipality of nearly 2,400 inhabitants in whom the poverty rate is high twice as like the land average. 
It is on the one hand a stronghold of the literature and, on the other hand, an example him - sometimes convicted, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south which has her roots in the American slavery. 
It is not astonishing that inhabitants are here proudly as well as on the hat. 
And so properly the doubts began around Eatonville's image, actually, with Zora as here all Hurston call. 
She introduced to the world her hometown in books which came sincerely and were written in dialect, as well as " Mules and Men " (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) 
Five sales in the Florida guide changed the town which lies quite near of the route 77, a street through the often-forgotten center of Florida leads, to the scenes of black history and human drama. 
Cheeky like Oskar in the real life as well as in the literature, Hurston reader led to the store of Eatonvilles to the first mayor, then Joe Clarke, and turned to more private affairs. 
" Off the street to the lefts ", she wrote, " is the brown white lacquered modern school, with her cultivated gardens and playgrounds after which always Howard Miller looks, although he can barely read and write. " 
She also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn " drinks of every kind sold and was auch immer to hourly rooms fits. " 
In only few hundred words Hurston associated Eatonville with selfgovernment, but also with illiteracy, the second marriage and sex. 
This was definitely no guide. 
Indeed, this was not a portrait which was estimated by all. 
" Zora described the things in such a way as they were ", according to the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls the Hurston perpetuated, while she quoted the men who sang songs about them her beauty which were more fully of sexual allusions. 
She added: " Some people did not like this. " 
One remembers here still Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly, after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that if Hurston came to the town showered, she did this mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and with trousers dresses, in a town even today itself something imagines on her venerable clothes style. 
According to Mr. Franklin most inhabitants were fascinated, while many they despised. 
" The people were to be seen always gladly Zora ", said Mr Franklin. 
But " she never remained too long ", he added there during him in his chair swung, on a terrace situated to the back which looks at the Sabelia lake in which Hurston was christened most probably. 
As a Hurston in 1960 died it was poor and her books were made a mistake. 
Together with the large part of the world Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them. 
Although she was once a famous author, a Zeitgen�ssin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman in the Barnard college in the 1920th, became they in fort Pierce, Florida where she lived, buried in an anonymous grave. 
In Eatonville there was no big commemorative celebration, no public readings in the big style. 
" I do not think that they have understood her contribution in the world or her inheritance in the least ", according to Valerie Boyd, author of " Wrapped in Rainbows ", a biography about Hurston it was published in 2003. 
The turn came in the 80s. 
Orange county authorities wanted to lay a f�nfspurige highway through the town to substitute for the Kennedy boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the municipality. 
Orlandos suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 by the western outskirts. 
The suggestion was presented when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history. 
Compulsive integration, among the rest, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the municipality. 
In the 50s the fight against mixing of different races brought hatred in the community. 
" In this time often came a heap of white boys and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting apart ", said Mr. Franklin. 
" There was even once a woman besides was killed. 
They threw a water melon from the car. " 
In 1955 Hurston questioned in a writing to the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the uppermost court of law to force integration, while she called his decision in the case Brown against the school council as " insulting instead of my race respecting ". 
Nowadays inhabitants say that although the abolition of the racial segregation was positive in some regard, she weakened them the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of his youngsters. 
" Black children were accustomed it to be embraced - I remember this - one embraced his teacher in the morning and one embraced his teacher in the evening ", according to N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing manager of the charitable group for the protection of the Eatonville community. 
This could be maintained so long, she added, to teachers and pupils came no more from the same place. 
" One did not embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there a cultural gap exists ", said Mrs. Nathiri. 
However, the civil rights have contributed to the fact that place was created for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who ignored prejudices, as well as she did it, with positive self-confidence and statements such as " How somebody can refuse to go along the joy of my society! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975 the author Alice Walker on the way did anonymous grave to herself Hurstons and started to fight for the revival of her fame. 
Five years later a much promised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was to be found in the book shelves, and did them once more a part of the American literature canon. 
The major road project came exactly at a time, in the Eatonvilles the most famous daughter once again in the light of the general public stood. 
And Hurstons old neighbors them saw this time as a rescuer. 
The municipality began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festivals to point what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration. 
Some years later the district of his road construction plans turned away. 
" The plans of a f�nfspurigen major road animated the town, accelerated the whole at top speed, woke up real civil pride ", said Mrs. Nathiri. 
Mrs. Boyd a little more simply expressed it: " Zora saved Eatonville. " 
The victory against the major road project has contributed to a change of the self-image of the town. 
There came more and more incomer, as well as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who goes since 1993 here to the church, and locals started to estimate the past anew. 
Eatonville was taken up in 1998 in the national historical register. 
A new one-story library (of course to Hurston named) opened in 2006 on the new-paved and improved in appearance Kennedy boulevard. 
Nowadays Eatonville is still a specific feature in Florida: only 6 miles of the city center Orlandos she can sometimes feel like a lane Hinter in the summer rain, as small as at that time as them was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880th. 
(Nowadays she is black to 90%.) 
Outsiders in search of the history Eatonvilles and his meaning are often still treated with care. 
An approval is necessary for most interviews in the approach and certain things - as well as the wall painting of Eatonvilles of the oldest church which was painted by a white and shows black men at the field work - may not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a predilection for Dark red, still fear that her guarded community is misunderstood. 
And still, at the same time to the Hurston festival bigger became, a raised degree was also born in home pride. 
Above all young people incline as to see Eatonville as Hurston her whole race saw: wonderfully, mixes with all his problems, neither worse even better and as proudly, creatively and diligently, stupidly and like any other race group and people's group in America. 
It is the frank love to this town one in the voice of Mr. Franklin nephews can hear, to 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, that plans after the college to return to Eatonville to work in the city administration or at the police which could use some help according to him. 
And even the younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from winter park, have learned to describe Eatonville properly. 
" Most people who drive through only here will think: " Oh this town is nothing in comparison to all the others ", said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after the church. 
" But if one really stops and looks a moment long at his history, it is a very nice town. " 
Here with us in New York one speaks fluently Finanzlatein. 
At first sight nothing has changed. 
If tourists kept away in Manhattan from the newsstands and the immense television screens in the Times Square, they would not notice at all that they are in the middle of a debacle. 
They would never believe that over her heads, in the schuhschachtelartigen offices with the glass facades, bankers and Hedgefondverwalter which have the monopoly in New York have daily the worst horror work day since the stock market fall of 1929. 
The suppliers still push with loud rattles the metal Teew�gen along sidewalks and carry trays with muffin for the breakfast meetings are loaded. 
Latinos still shuffle between flatlets around like human pack animals load with around 50 ironed T-shirts which hang on a pole lying on her shoulders similar to yoke. 
Clerk still wait in himself on the sidewalks to considering food states for her Fr�hst�cksbagel and it is still to be got impossibly on a weekday between 16 and 19 o'clock a yellow taxi. 
It did not feel at all like a crisis, until I decided Thursday nachmittag on account of all end of the world gossip to open a new savings account. 
Although I had decided to lay my duty way timewise on the quiet late afternoon in my family branch JP Morgan Chase, quite about 20 people queue stood. 
Not to take off in the monetary counters around money or to deposit, but in the customer service-counter where regular customers checkbooks order, ask tourists for the way to department store Macy's and where new customers open accounts. 
Most before me, so I learned later from Stiffly, my " personal bank employee with license ", stood for same reason like I queue. 
in contrast to me, nevertheless, they had already removed her savings of smaller banks, at places from where they oscillated, as well as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Iceland. 
They had removed money of so-called Thrifts (a little of a building society resembling), loan banks and those local savings banks which have branches only in a state and say that them her customers like family treat. 
Last year 15 these banks are quiet and have gone quiet bankruptcy. 
During the last pair of days Washington Mutual went over, a bank with arrangements at the rate of 327 $ billions, in bankruptcy management and when letzen Friday inhabitant of New York about the week-end home drove, Wachovia, an other bank which owns savings arrangements to the value of 440 $ billions was in search of a saving buyer. 
In the fear of an other collapse, the office and store employees brought before me were waiting her cash to a bank as a sure harbour is looked, a bank for most rescue takeovers in the embankment Street is responsible. 
Quite normal inhabitants of New York have appropriated fluent Finanzlatein during the last weeks. 
A woman who called up in my Chinese family supermarket took with so much closeness from relation on Lehman Brothers, the bankruptcy gone bank and their emaciatedly looking chairman of the board Dick Fuld as if she blasphemed a decayed colleague. 
And Lyn, around the 50-year-old uniformed Concierge of my residential block has left our usual entertainment subjects about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery. 
" Now I have all my savings in monetary market fund " she told to me after my visit at the bank. 
" I have changed, I enter no more Risko. " 
Muslemische graves violated during swing to the right in Austria 
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing of the Austrian right liberal party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, member of the Belgian right Pertei Vlaams importance, take part on Thursday 17th January, 2008, in a demonstration in Antwerp to represent the organization " towns against islamization ". 
They carry signs in the style of traffic sign on one mosque is illustrated, crossed out with a red line. 
The police accuses right-wing extremists of the desecration of a grave on a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same week-end at the extremely right party considerable profits with the parliamentary election of the land register. 
At night from Friday on today tomorrow more than 90 graves on the cemetery were hard damaged in Traun near Linz in one, according to police, organized action. 
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, hold, however, detective this for an attempt to veil the motive from the hatred on Muslim immigrants done extremists. 
It is not clear whether the incident stands in any way in connection with the choices. 
A speaker of the local Islamic community said them are " profoundly shaken " about the news of the desecration of a grave, it took place as herself the religious month of the Muslim Ramadans to the end inclines. 
At the same time a round conscience research is waiting in Austria, after the land slided in the yesterday's parliamentary election to the right. 
The Austrian Freedom Party and the alliance for the future of Austria which both far on the right to directed parties nearly 30% of the voices got exerted themselves in her election campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of her election slogans were criticized by opponent as xenophobic. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairperson of the Austrian Freedom Party which won 18% of the voices exerted himself for a ban of headscarfs and Burkas and did even his aversion against food kund which one associates in general with Islam. 
With his last rally in Vienna he spoke of a " European brotherhood " for the prevention of the growth of Islam. 
Both parties want to forbid the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols of a continuous islamization of Austria and Europe are. 
Surveys and analyses which were carried out immediately after the choice and which say that the extreme rights are the politically strongest block in the land point to the fact that this new development is based on young voters who come along worries about her future in the European Union.

` I receive the master behind the stage to hold on his character ', G�nter Brauer, photographer. 
No sales, no frill, no costumes for the appearance. 
The nature of the big flamenco dancers who renounce the concentration and devote themselves to the interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man. 
On the one hand artist 
On the other hand, personality 
I look in private life, at these moments which are foreign for the audience, I know, when I can find typical gesture, the depth of a stolen look or Ausdr�ckst�rke of the hands which are procured because they are not entered the stage for the personality. 
In his project 'Flamenco-people' German photographer G�nter Bauer shows rich in change histrionics of some stagings on the stage with singer, dancer and guitarists. He was known by this side for the artists still a little. 
With this suggestion the photographer creates a special Ikonografie of the flamenco representation at different levels. 
The exhibit which belongs to the program of the month of the photograph of the flamenco ` reflects the international importance of flamenco which becomes bigger and bigger from the day day, ', explains the artist and makes clear that 'Flamenco-people' ` can be every any person, but if one looks the photos, the viewer notices that these are no typical pictures of artist on the stage. 
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists, they are able on the stage passion to provide sadness, joy and to move with it the audience. 
To be able to hold on the personality of these artists, one must do no photos on the stage. 
Their personality and her character is in her hearts. 
What was interested me to create a personal atmosphere which would enable to me to hold on the characters of the biggest flamenco masters with the photo camera '. 
Farmer, inspired by the festival ` Cante de read Minas', came along in 1997 on a long trip to take a photo of singer, of Gitaristen or dancer with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the Bildsortierungsfunktion of the camera and the available material, originated the pictures which remind of classical photograph. 
The application of different stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the picture by which to the picture the modernity and the idea, as the farmer understands flamenco, are lent: ` The music with traditional roots which changes and surprises every day '. 
This is not only the dance, the song or the instrumental play in themselves, but the personality of the artist, his character which entices the audience with his art. 
The search for the essentials, after certain something which becomes visible in form of the hearing, the being is and was the steady purpose of this work which is presented in the next time in the gallery of the El Fot�mata. 
Known personalities in flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and other belong for the narrow choice of nearly seventy artists who were photographed. 
The project became an anthology of the flamenco and will soon appear book, with all portraits from the exhibit. 
Farmer's passion to the portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago once more and to realize as ` portraits of the veterans of the Sports' (` of SportARTproject'). 
Although the drafts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives ` to it like me very much to take a photo of the people, to get to know them and to move me into their life state, it is for a short moment or a longer time. 
I think that in the area of the photograph the portrait is the most difficult type. 
You meet or bump into persons, personalities whom you sometimes do not know at all, or they leave you for a pair of minutes alone to be able to do a photo. 
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I try to realize always my ideas. ' 
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco from today with the title 'Flamenco-people' is issued in the gallery of the El Fot�mata which is in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and runs in parallel with street la Alameda de H�rcules. You can visit the exhibit up to the 16th October. 
Vargas Llosa confesses that Roma whom he just writes ` a foolhardiness ' is. 
He does not know yet where the action of the novel takes place and what it concerns there, however, Mario Vargas Llosa tries pertinaciously the project on which he just works on promoting, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived twenty years in Congo and moved in the ama zones area.

He was introduced by F�lix Romeo and found out that he had an audience before himself which noticed that enough time was given to the Peruvian who owns a miraculous memory and big humor feeling not to be able to go through everything once more: how his appeal originated to the literature which want to experience from ` unusual adventurousness ', from ` joy in the reading ' and from ` more than before it ' it arises; as he writes and protects ` discipline ' to complement the lack of inspiration ' `, his intensive work with documentations, numerous corrections and reworkings which he does; how Faulkner, V�ctor Hugo and Alejandro influenced Dumas his appeal and which 'commemorative pictures' are it which form the basis for his stories. 
The hispanoamerikanische novelist put away that there is ` no way ' in which one can measure and where from one know whether books change the life, `, but I refuse at the fact to believe that the literature is a pure entertainment, a brief experience ', stressed Vargas Llosa who states that she causes ` effects ' and ` the people even more gets apart ', so, I did not ask the authors ` to myself to the ease leave ' and ` the responsibility ' for his appeal 'take over'.

Llamazares insists on the fact that the Andalusian federation of the combined lefts becomes responsible for the case Silva. 
Today gas par Llamazares, the main coordinator of VL and representatives of the combined lefts, has assured that the regional federation is that for education which will meet the decision in the case of the former town council to youth and sport of the city hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had withdrawn the last week, after he was accused to do shops with members of the family.

` Sangre de mayo ': Heroic book of Garci 
Inspires from ` Episodios Nacionales' of Benito P�rez Gald�s, Jos� Luis Carci shows the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in ` Sangre de mayo '. This is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with approximately 15 million euros of investment for the shooting. 
In this manner the cineaste has tried to explain ` today an amount from personalities and social analysis ' what he has admired always in the works of the famous novelist explained Carci by the presentation of the film with Quim Guti�rrez and Paula Echevarr�a at the beginning of a long list of the actors. 
` Sangre de mayo ' with a film length of more than 2,5 hours, is presented this Friday in cinemas and is shown later on transmitter Telemadrid than one 4-hour miniseries. 
Jos� Luis Garci, big fan of the literature of Gald�s, assures that thanks to this rotary work his 'childhood dream' went to fulfilment. He has to owe this to Esperanza Aguirre which asked him three years ago of the autonomous community Madrid to turn a commemorative film to the second century celebration on the 2nd November in Madrid. Above all because the history is based on the basis of ` Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order. 
The whole contribution of 15 millions which was put by the autonomous community Madrid for shooting offers Garci as he added, the ` unique possibility ' with the help of decorations and suitable clothings the picture of ` confused Spain which selected the wrong leader for the fight because the people by the fight for the independence and under the rule of the Ferdinands of VII in remains brought had become to explain '. 
However, the cineaste regrets that one could not count on the financing like with 'Alatriste' or ` lot fantasmas de of Goya' (two times high as with ` Sangre de mayo '), so, some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valc�rcel with whom Garci almost his whole career cooperated could not. 
That's why, Garci who was also a film manager in ` Volver a empezar ' has helped by his usual approach: he positioned himself on the stage to the actors with whom one must rehearse first before one starts to turn and for those which had done no casting, he seemed 'mortifying' and respect getting, ` a part of the occupation of the film manager consists in performing help in the theater and in the cinema to know what happens in the film industry in which one works. ' 
Many actors into whom he bumps in ` Sangre de mayo ' must repeat before his camera, like in the case of Miguel Rell�n, Carlos Larra�aga or Fernando Guill�n Cuervo. 
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (from which he has won one) is of the opinion and assured that none of three candidates who represent Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year shows a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Neither ` Sangre de mayo ', nor ` Siete mesas de billar franc�s' and, in the end, also not the well-chosen film ` lot girasoles ciegos'. 
For this film Garci expects no honorings. 
` At the beginning you believe that you work for the progeny, later you notice that it is only for prospering, and now you are contented if one has produced one more film ', explains Garci after more than 30 years of occupation. 
Isabel Bay�n recalls the recollection of the dancer from Seville T�rtola Valencia 
A flamenco dancer from Seville reveres a dancer who also come from Seville. 
Carmen T�rtola Valencia: her father was a Catalan (Floren� T�rtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), it is born in the quarter Triana and when she was three years old, her family has moved to London. 
She was a dancer and expert for oriental dances. 
She had a being tight life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and sat down for the abolition of the corset which limited the free female movement. 
The life of this woman, they her tracks with the dance and aesthetics revolution in Europe in the time between the wars leave has, fascinated Isabel Bay�n. 
` I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she has suggested this role to me what seemed to me impossible. ' 
` We do not try to tell about her life to preserve sonder her esprit, ' said the flamenco dancer. 
Their dance bases have helped me in flamenco a lot. 
` The dance of the Schmetterlings' seemed to me, for instance, like Guajira, or ` the dance of the queue ' how tango. 
Their dancing was sensuous and to me has been said that my dancing also lies in this aesthetic area ', she states. 
The staging counts on two unusual cooperating: with Miguel Poveda who will sing once more for Isabel by one of her images, as he has done it also in ` La puerta abierta '; and with flamenco master craftswoman Matilde Coral who wanted to work exceptionally together with one of her ex-pupils. 
` Matilde plays T�rtola, a very ripe personality. 
I am happy because she agreed to help in my work, and I feel very much honored. ' 
The staging also counts on musical composition and the Gitaristen Jes�s Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor�n; with the Percussion of El P�jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el viola and the collaboration with actor Juanfra J�arez, he ` takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were divas with whom he falls in love over and over again. ' 
In this work one also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman who became known in places situated so far like India, to the United States or Russia and, in addition, in whole Europe, although she has ordinarily lived in London. 
` I wanted to recall them to recollection, because I think, she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain epoch and whose works today nobody more knows how to estimate and they, so, still less ', states Bay�n. 
Today the image takes place around 20:30 in the theater Lope de Vega. 
The publication of the book ` Diario de un poeta reci�n casado ' also encloses the Triennium 
The presentation of the first illustrated issue from ` Diario de un poeta reci�n casado ' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at a place where Juan Ram�n Jim�nez married in 1916 Zenobia offers a suitable atmosphere to carry out planned activities by order of the Andalusian council for culture to celebrate the ` Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ram�n ' (in 2006-2008). The purpose is the memory of the fiftieth jubilee of the rental of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the day of death of the both. 
Thus ` the Triennium is concluded by Zenobia and Juan Ram�n ' with the new issue of this work, with the international congress which takes place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ram�n Jim�nez-Zenobia and with the itinerant exhibition ` Juan Ram�n Jim�nez: ` Aquel chopo de luz ' which was opened in May and after which she was in different places in Andalusia now New York reached and is presented in the course of the international congress. 
The Andalusian council for culture has also received 800 copies from ` Diario de un poeta reci�n casado ' which were published by Pedro Tabernero and were illustrated by Pacobo P�rez-Enciso. The purpose is to be made the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more known. 
The USA can fancy without Paul Newman badly 
` God sometimes creates perfect personalities. 
Paul Newman was one of it. ' 
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field who cooperated with him in 'sensation reporter', and from the image ruling at that time of the US-American cinema which became in the sting to calm ones, came from completely America to Newman with his inspiring image and followed her. 
To lend show simply what cost it them him the Oscar. 
And when he withdrew in 2007. 
And he knew that he was very ill. 
Nevertheless, that was a big blow for everything. 
` What sometimes feels one, is substantially more than one expression, and now I have lost a big friend ', said Robert Redford weeping, ` my life and my land were the biggest Drolligkeiten of his life. ' 
Nobody was afraid neither to make itself ridiculous, nor to exaggerate. 
As a 'father' of the cinema and the native country he has died at a sad moment at which fear of terrorists and before the market breakdown rules, in which the low-spirited self-esteem the American on the desperate search for reasons to get back dignity is. 
If in this hard time without virtue only few people whom one can admire remain, one must not necessarily be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
For everything he virtually embodied a Platonic ideal of the beauty and the truth. 
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered like different losses also profits: was founded by the endowment which has made a mistake to the fight against the drugs and to honor of his son from the first marriage who died of overdose up to own brand of home-baked and organic products. 
All that is a present for the land in which it cost him a lot of trouble to assert itself against a deadly food culture. 
A wide wave of the surprise hits very high over Hollywood without taking into consideration nationality and nationality to take. 
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a person has died, but the whole era. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film manager and Oscar prizewinner, said that the work with Newman was no less than the point of his career no more or. 
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia dared to call Newman his biggest inspiration. 
` The biggest of us to all has left us ', confirmed George Clooney, maybe one of few which dare today try to live like Paul Newman lived: high requirements for the righteousness receive, a responsible private life, far from the cameras lead remotely. 
This is not always easy or not even possibly in the today's media jungle. 
But there is somebody who tries it, and Paul Newman was an example of it. 
He separated once and was married afterwards fifty years with Joanne Woodward to whom he was loyal, although there absolutely many possibilities was not to be. 
For what should I eat an inhabitant of Hamburg on the street if I have at home fillet? ', he often joked himself. 
In heaven he will be proudly on the fact that on the earth his daughters have the same opinion like his fans what is not necessarily usual in America. 
` From all big roles which he played on none he was as proud as of those of the loyal spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandpa and of the philanthropist ', they say. 
For the Olympic games the streets fall short in Madrid. 
Yes which is a dream many of us to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, nevertheless, after the failure for 2012, it can be maybe in 2016. 
But I ask myself: ` Are we prepared for it? ' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not right! 
It was called perfect street, and according to my judgement, it was the worst street with all around and in it which there was. 
Of course this is an amount of nonsense if one followed the assessment and I could check it, would not have come through something so unambiguously. 
But, we go through from the outset everything. 
The nonsense starts the Ticketholen which allows to you to go as more first. 
It also does not seem to me to be bad, but if they allow to already go forward you, they should also give to you everything (including chip to avoid the traffic jam on the street). 
Thus, nevertheless, not. 
Here they let you only get the ticket (the first nonsense which consists in passing only, so,) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! There was the T-shirt only in the size ` hall' (the second nonsense because I need the size XL) 
Where do we live then, actually? 
Or is it in such a way that was decided after the crisis only small to buy much cheaper shirts from less material? 
Thus well, things like this are a little thing in comparison to the days on the street. 
Apart from the fact that one must go very early to get the chip, is there already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, one must leave the backpack. 
The waiting has lasted more than 35 minutes what is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected. 
In the end how it was also to be expected, the street started and we did not have our back bags before it leave, even if one had succeeded once, but to fetch back them would be quite difficult. 
In addition, it looked, in these 40-minute waiting period after rain, so that it came to the temptation to organize a national uprising and to attack the small house. 
I believe, mornings will have absolutely some 500 people pneumonia and some like I will appear because of this chip which I have got not even on time with the classification, I can already imagine that the exit was wrong stamped. 
Naturally if one asked me for a perfect street, this street would never occur to me. 
Thus I believe, we will still dream long of a town which is well prepared for the Olympic games 
Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
On ` Emerging Technology Conference ', organizes from WITH, has introduced to Microsoft the progress of the new picture recognition system and the human interaction, a being of the artificial intelligence without a lot of intelligence which is able, nevertheless to do some primitive tasks as for example a taxi order (or in the case of Microsoft that is a route planner to move on the campus of the enterprise). The system follows what hears it during the entertainment. 
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this 'Rezeptionistin' can recognize how many persons are in the space who they are and remember even how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of her entertainment. 
It can also arrange the persons present according to the conversations in the groups. 
In the presentation video ` the Rezeptionistin' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not accompanying to the group which leads with her conversation, and that also no company employee is. 
She asks whether the person wants to visit here somebody and answers that she soon listens. 
Everything without blue Screenshot 
Impressively 
This is absolutely the future. 
Now the enterprise has the better things upon which it can concentrate, for example, on the next version of her operating system Windows. 
This week one spoke very superficially about the strategy change of Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be quicker and not have many integrated programs so. 
Steve Ballmer found out that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would function 5 times faster. Person, Steven, this will be only for to few. 
Everything is only one statement if one thinks that Microsoft in Windows added to versions an one or other function and ` Extras'. 
The change of course is worthwhile 
Microsoft is right, the operating system loses bit by bit to meaning, exactly like the software. 
When Google chrome appeared in the net, was a part of the theory that it is the first step of Google to compete with Windows. 
Cleverly many pointed out to the fact that the browser is no operating system. 
The operating system, as an inalienable part, will be always necessary, so that hardware and software can function at the same time. 
The operating system fulfils the function which can be compared to the function of his wife or his husband if it is a matter of informing of something his mother-in-law. 
That's right. 
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth. 
What said Ballmer this week, is the confirmation of this idea. 
The people give every time less attention to the operating system, for it more to the web browser. 
The computer is only begun to explain the Firefox, the Explorer or chrome and we spend every day more time in surfing, than in the surroundings of the 'windows'. 
For which does half serve in the computer of available applications? 
Less is more 
And Windows 7 must go more compactly, much is more compact than Vista. 
Lighter, did not exaggerate in such a way, less complex. 
The interest of Microsoft consists more in integrating his on-line services which can become then, in the end, the alternative to Google. 
In the reality they need this, without doubt. I bring a small example of it. 
I have the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreational rooms for Microsoft employee at the beginning of the month done. 
On the soft drink machine a sign is fastened: ` Your search. Our future '. It prints out a request to use own tools for on-line search. 
In 2006 an independent study came in the end that used 66% of the employees in Microsoft, Google for the searches in the net. 
By the way, the last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows mobile 7 has got in the delay. 
She will appear not beginning, but in the end of 2009, rather even in 2010. 
Microsoft searches the possibility to bring mobile 7 at the same time on the mark to Windows 7 and Windows. 
Every day the phone changes into a computer. 
The Android and iPhon are already at the market, but the other delay will cost money. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso has worn it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore this brand in ` Blood of slide moon ' from Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in the ` godfather ' from Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing of a well built priest. 
If we start to enumerate the countless star appearances, we can back on the picture of a very strong man, with a sharp beard fall back which had raised heavyweight in a traveling circus. 
Basically, that is a typically male T-shirt from cotton, armless and waisted. 
The English speakers call it 'refuel'. Nevertheless, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles excels all the other brands. 
First, because of his great name, although it is called in the narrow circle 'Marcel. The legend tells that the name origin is connected with sport and from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, to the lover of the singer Edith Piaf, come. 
` La of Marcel ' towers above everything because of his excellent cotton, because of his discerning unisex cut and distinguishes itself by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizably) which have these T-shirts as a detail in the neckline. 
And attention, the Belgian company concentrates not only upon the production from ` tanks'. 
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer Retro, cardigans and Kaschmire, trousers from cotton, T-shirts with stripe, babies, Mini shorts � 
Modeled and comfortable underwear.

The drivers who can become back-due because of the blood-alcohol level will have to install the 'Alcolock'. 
The authority arranges that the driver, three official punishments had because of the blood-alcohol level, in his car this system installs which forbids to him to begin the car in the drunk state. If he is alcoholized, the car does not jump. 
The initiative was already announced last month in June and by now a part of the report the Generalstaatsanwaltschaf is. According to her information it concerns a pilot's project which will last during 1 year. 
The purpose is the rehabilitation of the driver, which is why this one course agrees for the re-education of the traffic behavior. 
Except the general public prosecutor's office, according to experience, will also take part in it the traffic ministry and the endowment of the technical institute of security of the cars. 
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the drivers which were indicated more than once because of the driving under the influence of drink sat down again in tax. 
'Alcolock' this would prevent because it is a system by the car linked, it misses the alcoholic content in the breathed out air and prevents autostart if the driver has done breath test; or if an alcohol concentration is ascertained which higher than is permitted. 
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are carried by that which covers the sanction. 
In this connection, a study which was carried out in the USA in 2007 has shown that with these devices equipped cars already prevent in the first year after his introduction to 65% of the infringements. 
In Spain one calculates on the fact that it could be saved yearly 115 human lives. 
The measure limits itself to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behavior, before it becomes a criminal offense. 
And to ease around her implementing, a legitimate reform on the usual way can be realized, and a reform of the basic law which is necessary for the criminal proceedings process is still demanded. 
The device at the Spanish markets, in no business still is availably, although it was already inserted in some utility vehicles and vehicles of the public transport. 
Just tomorrow, the chamber of deputies becomes because of the initiative of the Spanish socialist Labor Party which suggests installing this system in school buses vote. This was already done in France.

The best premium of the fashion 
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of the fashion and there was probably no substantially excellent fashion designer and Bonvivanten as a Valentino. 
Mango presents the second issue of the fashion competition ` el B�ton mango Fashion Adwards' for the support and international increase of young fashion talents. 
This is distinguished with monetary price at the rate of 300,000 euros.

1001 councils against stress 
There are not 1000, but a possibility more to forget chaotic everyday life rapid to us. 
And if these are also a few, everything are collected in a book in which it stands how one comes to the relaxation. The book comes to the bookstores on the 30th September. 
The alarm clock is a punishment if he rings at 7 o'clock in the morning, but even worse the image appears, again in the hectic rhythm which requires the topical life to walk in. 
The office calls the tension and the computer which lead to back pains. 
The stress is Bad of the 21-st century. 
But there is none and not two methods, around the everyday exhaustion and the problems how one switches off of the professional life to fight. 
However, the number rises, no more and no less than to 1001. 
Beside yoga positions, the classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott shows the whole list of the possibilities which are adapted to the taste and the time of every single one in the book. 
The work against the stress tells ` to relax 1001 possibilities ' and thus the rest which provides the book comes to the bookstores of publishing company Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
Who thinks that it is impossible to reach the rest in the areas like workplace with the help of personal contacts, such belief disproves this manual. 
In addition, the methods are offered how one remains in the contact with the nature or 100% of natural prescriptions suggested which lead to the relaxation. 
If the adrenalin in your veins no more hochsteigt to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come, themselves on the sofa subjoin to switch off the brain and to concentrate upon the reading. 
In the sleep talk 
At night some children speak 
I mine not those which wake and tell to us, besides, something what has happened during the day before it, but the children, which speak during the sleep. 
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will have got a fright, but in the reality that has no meaning. 
This is a positive sleeping disturbance which is called the speech in the sleep. 
It is quite spread, above all with the children and youngsters. 
Absolutely, it was told more than to one of you that at night you have spoken. 
This phenomenon can appear as occasional (once in the life, for example, how during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once per week, once in the month �), the next day the child can remember nothing. 
There is no reason which causes this appearance. 
Connections with other phenomena are often searched in the sleep, like nightmares, panic fear at night, Enuresis noctura (bed-wetting at night), speech in the sleep in request, but it gives no reason for it. 
As we have mentioned it already earlier, it can lie with very much high fiber, stress situations or excessive demand. 
Anyway, is the a little investigated phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it appears is very variable. 
It can be that one speaks quietly in single words, whispers or it an opposite can completely be (shouts, to wines, long discussions �). 
In the cases if the statement is very intensive it is recommended to observe the child and to let discuss with a specialist to check whether a problem is which causes fear and comes about in this manner. 
We have said that it is a positive disturbance, thus it is not treated, it is, it is connected with another sleeping disturbance which can be treated (for example, with the Schlaf-Apnoe or with the stress). 
What one is able to do is, a series of easy preventive measures carry out: 
Do not try to excite the child before sleeping. 
Thus, quiet play for the child select and avoid stressful television programs which are awful and too wild a little bit. 
With the nervous children to whom Entspannungen are recommended relaxation methods can be applied to help them, to get a certain internal rest. 
This helps the child to sleep quietly. 
If the speech seems in the sleep once, the rest tries to preserve. 
Remembers that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will be able to remember nothing what has happened. 
useful advice 
Do not wake it. 
This is useless, because the child is unaware, you will tear it from the sleep. 
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, thus it rests. 
Remembers if it is scrared after a pair of phenomena, is recommended to let discuss or to find out which reason the child has for the fear. 
If they understand what says it (what is not so usual), the child does not put under pressure to carry out an examination and to get out more information. 
Thus you will be able to reach with it nothing because if the child sleeps, it is unaware and cannot think about it. 
In addition, you will hear what says it, but you will not know what dreams it and why it says this, so, they are carefully with the interpretation of the information and the ends which you pull from it. 
Maybe, one does not say to the child that at night you hear this and know his secrets. 
Not even as a joke. 
This causes a lot of fear. 
Thus, does to you no worries, it is nothing bad, this is a moment which lasts only few minutes. 
Illh�usern ..., finally 
After a long long hard haul is to Illh�usern on the field, finally, again on successful course. 
Without big strain the yellow-black numerous chances to score won themselves and got to move one of it, and to win thus the play. 
The tempo of this meeting at which the attackers had trouble to show her skill was not high very much. 
After the first attack of the guest's captain Kauffmann whose distant shot passed briefly the corner the play should dominate to Illh�usern with ease, and only Fonderflick with a distant shot succeeded alternately, then in challenging brain with a high-pass filter, and Romain with a shot with the Fu�spitze, the defense of Denmark. 
The opposing team perched in the field middle and let pass only the lively Riahi at the head of the storm. 
The beginning of the second half time should go decisively his with at first two by Riahi and Temporale to won chances to score, and immediately afterwards with the first gate for the Illh�user by Marais which stood right exactly to accept again a ball which had been repulsed in the first attempt by Diebold. 
However, the illh�usische goal scorer should not be able to enjoy his luck long and about twelve minutes later to the bank be sent by which his team's companions put under according to figures weiterspielen must go. 
Nevertheless, Denmark did not know how to use this and set illhaeusischen Eleven no big problems which withdrew only a little, around her defense 'condense' to, except in the very last seconds of the play in which the ball passed after a big mess very near the slat.

The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the significant complete refinery in Donges in the evening.

Really the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide planned discussion on the reactions to the movement and on his participation in in the ministry of agriculture and fishing in Paris. 
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the persons responsible of the national fishing committee which has not supported her movement.

The occupational fishermen who pay no taxes on diesel costs of the liters topically about 50 cents, but they think that the breakeven point of a boat can be reached only with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.

Obama, winner after points in the first television duel 
An other followed the first debate of both candidates for the White House of Friday to find out who arose than winner from it, John McCain or Barack Obama. 
As expected the QGs announced her own victory in this television duel which should be pursued by a third of the American families for the choice the Republican and the democrats. 
The political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's achievement, although absolutely considerably, not was 'excellent enough to allow to him, to stop his decline in the electoral surveys five weeks before the presidency choices still. 
The Gallup institute by which on Saturday an opinion poll was published which lies according to Obama with five points in front (49% to 44% for McCain) is of the opinion that the democrat does unambiguously the better figure. 
With the still undecided voters, thus to those on whom it depends now Obama with 39% arose as a winner from the surveys, while according to a CBS survey 25% of them see McCain as a winner. 
Obama should his projection on Thursday with the good achievement which is expected from his competitor Joseph Biden with the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin, can confirm 
` It would be a mistake to underestimate them. 
She has good instincts ', nevertheless, warned this week-end Bill Clinton. 
The 70-year-old McCain did not stop moving his unquestionable experience in the area of the foreign affairs in the foreground, and underlining the 'naivety' of his opponent with regard to these questions, besides, quite clearly which formed the center of this first television duel. 
` Senator Obama does not seem to understand that of ...', he stressed several times. 
` I do not believe that senator Obama disposes of the necessary experience and the necessary knowledge to become a president ', in addition, he assured. 
An attack point which is preached since yesterday in the republican electoral commercials. 
Obama itself stressed that he represents the future. 
He commented briefly and exactly without letting bring from the version. 
He moved his ability in the foreground to meet good decisions and to renew the picture which has the world of the United States. 
` McCain has not still understood, Obama, however, already ', put this week-end a democratic electoral commercial against it in which Republican was accused of not having grasped the complete magnitude of the crisis which presses on the ` American of the street '. 
` While to 90 minutes of the debate John McCain wore an amount of things about me to say, but nothing about you ', prangerte Obama yesterday before 20,000 people who had assembled on the occasion of an election rally in Nord-Carolina in flowing out rain. 
He not even mentioned the words 'Middle class' or 'Worker'. ' The financial crisis gets Obama which the Americans hold for in geeignetsten to save the economy even still on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage. 
` The next week could show a determining turning point ', yesterday the high-powered democratic senator Charles Schumer estimated. 
The democratic representative cream Emanuel, a former member of the government Clinton, compared the ` good economic instincts ' Obamas to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
For the democratic candidate the momentary crisis is ` the final judgment of an eight-year-old bad economic policy which has moved by George Bush and has been supported by senator McCain '. 
After he had stressed once more that he even probably created it to lower the taxes for 95% of the Americans in spite of the variations in the embankment Street, the senator of Illinois pointed out to the fact that would own the creation of a possible energetic independence of the land and the support of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, for him the uppermost priority. 
McCain against it wanted to establish an arrangement from 45 nuclear power plants till 2030.

` You have noted that in Minsk a choice took place? ' 
Youngster and member of the opposition demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belorussian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections already in Ahead. 
Some hundred Byelorussians assembled Sunday evening since closing the polling places on the marketplace of Minsk to protest against the deceitful character of the parliamentary elections. 
Although still no result had been announced, numerous youngsters had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: ` The dictator should withdraw '. 
Some admit that they have not chosen only at all: ` What this uses if they do, nevertheless, anyhow with my voice what they want ', says a youngster. 
They do not believe that the regime which has appeared to the foreign observers in the best light to take up again the negotiations with the European Union is ready to carry out a democratic turn. 
The sanctions, under it the Nichterteilen of visas for 40 leading Belorussian personalities and the Aufeislegen of certain property, could be lifted if these choices were estimated by the observers as clean. 
According to the opposition they were not it. 
` We were excluded from the electoral committees and our observers might not take part in the counting up ', regretted Juri Potemkin, press agent of the union of democratic forces, to a heterogeneous union of twelve parties. 
This is a cosmetic change, Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate stresses for the presidency choice in 2006 and leader of the Pro Europe movement, because it matters who counts out the voices, and with us that is the executive. 
If representatives of the opposition enter in the parliament, because they were appointed, and not electively. 
But her move in the parliament can signify transmitting time on television, meeting in the regions and Gesetzesvorschl � �. ' 
The opposition is guilty it to itself to interfere into the political play, because ` the dialog with the European Union must be opened. 
Since if our economy which is to blame towards Russia gets in a crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we run the risk to become a protectorate of Russia. 
Now, we want independently his. 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe which has pursued the electoral procedure does not recognize the choice as valid. 
She stresses that the election turnout figures seem too high, and that the expansion of the casting of votes has flattened the way for any kind of manipulation in Ahead (26% of the voters of Minsk). 
` You have noted that a choice has taken place?, asks the leader social democrat Alexander Kozulin, one of both last political prisoners who were released in August this year. 
In the polling places nobody was. 
And these will be maximum five representatives of the opposition in the parliament, namely those who correspond in the earliest one to the images of the government. ' 
The silence of the night falls again about the October place. 
On television president Lukachenko and the members of the central electoral committee congratulate themselves on her success. 
Discussion - From the blood that again became sure 
Yesterday Hema Quebec celebrated the 10-th anniversary of her foundation, and her president, Dr. Francine D�cary, had all reason to be glad, because Hema Quebec has become one of the most sure and most efficient blood banks of the world. 
And above all she has the trust of the general public wiedergewonnen which had hard been shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s. 
How one knows, were contaminated by the blood donations service of the Canadian red cross to administered national blood reserves during the 1980s with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus. 
In view of this drama and the discontent of the general public the government of Canada in February, 1994 initiated a public investigation escorted by the judge Horace Krever which had to the purpose to bring light in the circumstances which had led to a such tragedy and to work out guidelines to prevent a renewed disaster of this kind. 
While judge Krever still hesitated to deliver his report, at that time several provinces put a committee on the legs whose purpose was to develop a new system for the management of units of stored blood in Canada. 
In Quebec the committee G�lineau fulfilled this order. 
After the reports of G�lineau and Krever two blood banks were founded in Canada: To supply Hema Quebec which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, in order the other provinces and both territories. 
` In 1998, as Hema Quebec her work has taken up, 38% of the people barely had trust in the unit of stored blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. D�cary. 
The situation was disheartening. 
To improve by the huge strains to the security of the units of stored blood and by the work in this area during the following years, we have the trust of the general public won back, she says, before she stresses proudly that in the beginning of 2008 meanwhile nearly 94% of the population of Quebec trust had in Hema Quebec. 
Nevertheless, Dr. D�cary keeps in the consciousness that ` trust is something extremely breakable '. 
Since her foundation on the 28th September, 1998 Hema Quebec acts after the principle of the care. 
At this time we seen the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of the cattle insanity in Europe, a new kind Creutzfeldt Jakob-Krankheit, tells this woman who holds in 1998 the management since the foundation. 
` And we did not have the slightest notion whether this illness about the blood could be transferred. 
Thus we appealed at one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and G�lineau which applies exclusion measures according to one if one does not know this and if an illness progresses only slowly as it is obviously with Creutzfeldt Jakob-Krankheit the case which comments by a degeneration of the brain what leads without fail to the death. 
Thus one accepted in April, 1999 no blood of the persons who had stayed since 1980 longer than one month in the United Kingdom. 
Now, some years ago was proved without any doubt that this illness about the blood transfers. 
Thus this event has shown us that the principle of the care which we applied absolutely has a sense. 
In 1999 a lot of more precise technology appeared at the market to the recognition of HIV: The nucleic acid tests (NST) which enable to prove the occurence of the virus independently directly in the blood of the donator and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as it was the case with the tests used up to now. 
The NST enabled to shorten the incubation time which takes place between the time at which the person was infected and if the first viruses can be proved by our technologies in the blood, explains the specialist. 
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week. 
Thus became the risk that certain donators could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, reduces substantially. 
This improvement enabled, the risk to transfer AIDS about a blood transfusion to lower in substantial litre of beer. 
Nowadays one of 12 million persons runs the risk to receive infected blood with HIV. 
` In other words this is called that one would have to distribute 12 million units of stored blood, before somebody would be stuck on with HIV. 
Because Hema Quebec every year distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 units of stored blood, it would last more than 24 years, before a case appears, with the HIV about an unit of stored blood was transferred. 
I believe that, besides, one can feel fine nowadays if one gets a blood transfusion or prescribes to restore the health ', thinks the managerial boss of Hema Quebec. 
` Our challenge for the next ten years is to receive the security of our products. 
One never knows which illness cause can reach in the system. 
Only last year there has appeared on the island Reunion the Chikungunya virus which, just like the Westnil virus, by insects about the blood will transfer. 
We must supervise incessantly ', continues Dr. D�cary, before she stresses that, in addition, Hema Quebec must make available a sufficient care beside a sure care. 
` The need rises because the population grows old. 
Because the treatments are more aggressive to the cancer fight, the patients often need new red blood cells or platelets. 
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor's net to which on average only 3% of the inhabitants suitable to the blood donation of Quebec belong. ' 
Besides, can every healthy person who 18 years or is older and which fulfils suitability criteria, all 56 days, thus six times in the year, blood make a donation. 
On average 14% of the persons who make available her blood are not accepted because they have fallen ill, for instance, with AIDS or malaria, and who has traveled in a land in which malaria is spread, it is excluded for a year from the blood donation. 
` With these 3% we get to receive an inventory which corresponds to the needs of the hospitals. 
Lacking stocks are very rare. 
But one must renew the members of this donator's net if they can become older and donate no more blood. 
It is difficult to persuade the people, to donate blood, above all, however, to hold them and to bring them, to become regular donators. 
Nowadays the life is so hectic that one seldom finds the time to spend one hour with the blood donation ', regrets Francine D�cary. 
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars Hema Quebec delivers not only to units of stored blood, but also human fabrics, under it osseous grafts, heart flaps, eyeballs and skin which is used almost exclusively by heavy fire injuries. 
These fabrics are examined, worked on and frozen, before they are interstored with Hema Quebec which also administers the only public umbilical cord blood bank of Quebec. 
In the umbilical cord which was looked earlier than biomedical rubbish is in family cells rich blood which can serve to treat heavy illnesses, as for example leukaemia. 
` Some weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood test, and we plan to take thousand yearly more than. 
` We should probably begin in the beginning of the next year to make available it for transplants ', explains Dr. D�cary further who describes this program of the umbilical cord blood decrease as very much popularly. 
` Many mothers are persuaded to have no access to it ', because Hema Quebec lacks the means to offer this complicated and costly program in all hospitals of Quebec. 
Soccer - Impact in the semi-final 
Yesterday Montreals Impact has itself, thanks to 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all gates) against the Sounders from Seattle with the second and decide play of the quarter final series in the Saputo stadium with which the whole gate relation counted for which half final round of the qualifying matches of the first league of the USL qualifies.

After the first half time without gate for one as well as for the other side, the midfield player David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the formation Montreals. 
Roger Levesque was the only one who positioned himself Weakly Jordan for the Sounders in the way. 
If we remember that with the first play the Vor-und moving game series on Friday Impact had introduced in the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle 2 to 1 defeat. 
In the semi-final Impact will compete against the Whitecaps from Vancouver. 
Saturday evening Thunder could compensate 3 to 1 deficit by 4 to 3 victory in the moving game in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps entered with a whole gate relation of 5 to 4 still in the half final round. 
Impact will probably have to face Friday and Sunday the Whitecaps, but today the details of the play series are fixed. 
Very briefly - victory gate by Kovalev 
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to tackle the season. 
Last night educated unity sped up from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn the attack on the panthers from Florida with a storm fire what led to 3 to 2 victory. 
Kostitsyn, the star of the meeting, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two presentations and Kovalev transformed a passport in this victory play, the fourth one of the Tricolore in six preparatory plays. 
Kovalev achieved the victory, while he shot the only gate of the whole gunfight. 
` I am not ready yet, warned Russian 
I need one more play, so that I feel fine. ' 
` He has fixated in the first half time too much on it, noted Guy Carbonneau. 
But I believe, he has liked the end of the play. 
He received stormy applause. ' 
Charest places on the north 
The prime minister does not exclude to initiate choices still before the end of the year. 
As soon as the general assembly of the liberal party was to an end, yesterday Jean Charest proceeded to Jean talon in Quebec where new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be chosen in the today's partial choice. 
` Shift the course of our last big border in the north ': This is the long-term purpose which Jean Charest introduced yesterday with visual means with the general assembly of the liberal party of Quebec in Levis and he completely followed the guidelines. 
During his talk a kind of picture mill was projected behind him. 
On three gigantic screens spectacular pictures of hydroelectric power plants, mines, looked turned from Quebec in ` Google Maps', maps, etc. 
Big means like during the electoral period. 
Compared with the press the prime minister refused, by the way to exclude that he will hold the choices this autumn, even if he allowed to be reported that his appointment calendar is very full. 
The ` plan of the north ' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the prime minister has supposedly for Quebec, namely those of a ` new Wirtschaftsraumes' which intends an arrangement with France with regard to manpower, an arrangement between Canada and Europe and arrangements with Ontario. 
Although it was mentioned in the last time often in the speeches of the prime minister, had been the opening of the north - the northern area on the 49sten degree of latitude - never subject of a presentation. 
Nevertheless, the prime minister limited himself to it to explain, why the north is ` a jewel with huge potential ', however, called no date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects. 
At most some views of that in which could be worked more: Above all in the water energy, in the wood, but especially in the mining sector, favors above others by the growth of the threshold lands and the renewal of the public infrastructures. 
Of the enumeration Mr. Charests according to the north owns ` nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamond '. 
This ` area two times largely as France ' ` is in our nearness, is in Quebec. 
It is not only in our nearness, it is in 'us, he stressed to show how around clear that he tries to realize a national founder's dream. 
Quebec has grown very much by his connection with the north, he stressed: the street to the gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James bay. 
` It hears us, it is our future ', he added, after he had inserted a theatrical break to look at the gigantic map behind himself. 
The north, 70% of the area of Quebec, encloses a part of Labrador with which Quebec always called, explained the prime minister compared with the press. 
` This is a traditional posture which all governments pursued. 
There is a borderline in which there is no arrangement since very much long time if the opportunity comes up I will take this posture in the name of the government again ', he explained. 
In addition, ` with the climate change we must think over our vision of the north anew ', he explained and spoke about the northwest passage which will be practicable on account of the ice glazes the whole year. 
Before this new geopolitical background the prime minister thinks that it is almost a duty to take this area. 
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec handled very warily with them, and that they would profit from this project, above all the boys. 
Two former ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel L�tourneau (of former pekistischer representatives of Ungava) have already initiated consultations with about thirty communities. 
One minister's committee escorted by Beno�t Pelletier in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) takes an important place has taken up the works. 
The prime minister does not exclude a big meeting, ` not necessarily a summit ', but an opportunity with which ` one will create a common vision '. 
The development of the north will go, for the rest, according to the principles of the lasting development vonstatten. 
the plan the north is discussed `, is regulated and environmental-carefully ' be, he promised. 
Jean Charest described this 'vision', as if it is a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were before him in the office. 
` Like the liberals who were before us in the office we have rethought to transform the challenges into new growth and Entwicklungschanchen. 
This was, by the way, one of the subjects pouting over and over again of the week-end which was opened on Friday with a big cocktail party to the celebration of the 50-th jubilee of the takeover of the party guidance by Jean Lesage. 
One of the accepted decisions plans to rename the power station of Beauharnois as Ad�lard Godbout dam. 
` From Godbout, Hydro Quebec has created, about Lesage which has reached the quiet revolution and the nationalization of the water electricity, to Bourassa which has done the James bay our party knew how always to determine the future ', explained Jean Charest. 
Compared with the press he referred to another, this time conservative plan, namely on the program ` Roads to the North ' from John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
In relation on the project Water power dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, stresses Mr. Charest which would be planned his introduction for 2012. 
` This remains among us, but I plan to be present ', he entrusted his party members what caused in those thunderous applauses. 
The prime minister who has said in April that there was in 2008, and absolutely also in 2009, no choices, indeed, has the possibility to hold a choice this autumn what is possible to him in accordance with the law, not yet impossible. 
He stresses that his appointment calendar is full, nevertheless, above all because of a mission of the communal council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. 
The general assembly of the week-end got the liberal party chief a platform from nationalistic plans, above all from the ` constitution to concerning sighting ' which was accepted just like that: The PLQ particularly demands the recognition of the ` specific feature Quebecs' in the constitution. 
She would also like to own that Quebec appoints members of the council of the Canadian broadcasting company and telecommunications and that this a veto with regard to the decisions felled in Quebec. 
The guidelines of the plan the north were taken up by sides of the opposition with scepticism. 
The boss of the Parti Qu�b�cois, Pauline Marois, has brought out the policy for the development of north du Quebec again which has introduced government Landry in 2001. 
According to her the liberal government when it came in 2003 to the power has refused to apply this. 
If she had done it, ` today we would be already much other ', judged Mrs. Marois at the side of her nominee in Jean talon (where the choice today takes place) Fran�oise Mercure. 
The ADQ has expressed itself to support the acceptance of a plan the north by the government. 
` But what we want, is that this becomes not only a big image ', explained the party leader S�bastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont who comes back today from the vacation. 
Letters - a dishonored land 
It was Mr. Vic Toews, Ex-'Justiz of ' ministers (what an irony) in the cabinet Harper which allowed itself the last summer to say about Louise Arbour, it is a 'disgrace' for Canada. 
This woman whom do not end wishing fight for the justice has led and earns all our admiration to cover thus with disgrace, states just as much about the persons round the prime minister, how about Stephen Parker himself. 
We have to do it here with a government which has got theirs in the concentration camp Guantanamo caught compatriot not as only from all affected lands home. 
A government which not even takes into consideration that Omar Khadr was one more youngster when the things happened which are accused of him. 
The only government which breaks in spite of the fact that Canada has signed the Genevan convention, her word and allows to vegetate away a child soldier under inhuman conditions. 
The only one which lets itself down to a justice parody to estimate the guilt of the defendant. 
If we call ourselves in recollection that above all UNICEF, amnesty plead Internationally and the union of the Canadian lawyers to get home Omar Khadr, so that he gets a fair process in Canada. 
Exactly this government also closes the eyes before the torture: It interests them a little that a young adult will have broken after so many years of the torture absolutely for good emotionally. 
We are not aware of that yet, but we experience here just a perfidious curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word which carries Harper constantly like a flag before itself, and mouth from his sounds so inexpressive. 
There has come the time in which there is no more morality: One may ill-treat a Canadian citizen arbitrarily, torment and lock up, completely to Gutd�nken of a head of the government who is supported till this day only by the minority (he may belong after the 14th October completely to the minority ...). 
Many voters believe to find her welfare at a party which preaches virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has renounced from him what put out the call and the dignity of our land. 
The disgrace, Mr. Toews, lies in this Lossagung, and nowhere differently. 
Free opinion - the orwellsche speech of Barrick gold 
In her issue from the 17th September Le Devoir published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice general manager of the Canadian golden mine Barrick gold. 
This confirms, and, besides, pursues an orwellsche logic that the biggest golden production society of the world aimed at an action for slander more than six millions against three authors and a small impecunious publishing house, with the purpose to open a ` public transparent debate '. 
If it is right that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge about the truth, above all not in the case of actions for slander, but about the law. 
As expected, this basic difference was completely hid by Mr. Garver. 
Since for Barrick gold the best kind a public debate is to be led to do everybody in the ruin which dares to represent one of the opinion opposite to her. 
No matter how the process goes out which authors and the publishers of the book Noir Canada substantial sums will have to be economical to prepare her defense and to fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid from the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the golden mine. 
The tactics in these unequal fights is often, for the rest to ruin the defenders to force a concerted regulation which silences the opposition and deters, in addition, everybody which dares to deal once more with the question. 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public debate, it would have had to present her view of the things before the public opinion. 
By contrast what is quite usual in many of the lands in which Barrick gold works, debates are delivered in Canada ordinarily by the exchange of ideas and not by bat slashes. 
It would have been enough if the golden mine had disclosed her books and acts and had opened a real debate, by the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams which could have brought light in this question. 
But Barrick gold seems to have no trust in the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to the support of the authors of Noir Canada with a movement of the hand aside. 
Mr. Garver maybe explain ��߬����� can he ask at the same time for a 'public' debate and, besides, nevertheless, the opinions just of this general public ignore? 
Apparently this word in the world of the vice-president encloses only the generously paid-up lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a quite a lot cramped perception of the concept. 
In a democracy even slanderers the right have to speak. 
What does not understand Barrick gold - or does not want to understand - is that the general public which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this above all, because she rejects the crude posture of the golden mine. 
This general public is ready to listen Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a frame which many perceive as a toggle complaint (in the course of the ` public debate ' Barrick gold has directed just a demand to the authors of Noir Canada in whom she requires of them to use this concept no more ...). 
Apart from the surreal speech of Mr. Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct attack on the freedom to the academic research and the Wahrheitsfindung which are basically for every democratic society. 
She completely denies the right to quote plausible springs and to discuss facts and interpretations which form the base of the intellectual work. 
If it is impossible in a land like Canada to investigate subjects and to discuss which the rich enterprises of this world do not like who can do, otherwise, this then? 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public and clear debate, it could lead this, while she follows the scientific norms which were used by the authors of Noir Canada. 
She has to answer a right. 
The universit�re sphere to which we belong knows how to gain control for a long time to solve debates and discrepancies and conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold shows clearly that it, in contrast to that what she gives has no desire for a clear debate. 
This is a loss for the university world, just like for the public debate, and it time that the governments seize measures will limit the of such type unwarranted complaints. 
Rescue action for the embankment Street - democrats and Republicans get on 
Yesterday the management Bush and the leading congressional representatives, Republicans and democrats equally, came, finally, to an arrangement on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the big depression of the 30s. 
The new version of the plan more than 700 billion US dollars which should stop the financial crisis which shakes already for months the embankment Street must be still accepted by both congressional chambers. 
The gists are: A better control of the representatives of the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to protect the repayment of the used public money, to dam new orders, in order the number of the houses impounded on the basis of arrears, as well as to supervise the right, the salaries which are paid to the leading employees of the supported enterprises. 
Yesterday the American finance secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the representative's chamber Nancy Pelosi, and the representative present at the negotiations of the Republicans, senator Judd Gregg, announced, some minutes after midnight, the good news, after a 2-day negotiations marathon. 
` We have done big progress in the direction of an arrangement which will be market-effective ', explained the representative of the management Bush, Henry Paulson. 
` It happened everything to protect the real economy and the American people against the course crisis in the embankment Street ', explained the democrat. 
` This is the basic point: If we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and the riots will be huge in the everyday life of the Americans ', explained Republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had accelerated during the last both hours, from fear of the effect which would have had a renewed failure on the mood of the investors. 
The term which had been agreed was the market opening this morning. 
Both American presidential candidates who taken part only late in the negotiations appeared rather than an advocate of the arrangement without missing, nevertheless, expressing her discontent about the fact that one must meet them in this extreme way. 
Democratic senator Barrack Obama existed on the addition of certain orders to the arrangement, above all such which should enable to the owners to keep her houses, and such which concern the salaries of the leading employees of the enterprises saved by the state. 
` If one asks the taxpayers to seize extraordinary measures on account of the irresponsibility of certain persons, nothing is what one could congratulate himself on. 
But these measures are necessary, he explained on the American television broadcasting stations. 
When he was asked on another transmitter whether he is right for the suggested plan, his republican opponent John McCain answered: ` I would know with pleasure only the details, but I hope it. 
` The basic principles which I have read [show that of this one thing is which we will have to digest everything and with which we will be able to make headway. 
The option to do nothing at all, is not quite simply satisfactory ', he said. 
Of the 700 billion dollar plans is aimed on it, with the money of the taxpayers 
He comes 14 months after a crisis, released by burstting of a real estate bubble which led at first to the breakdown of the risky mortgage loans (Subprime), before she expanded on other forms of verbreiteterer loans (PCAA), and, in the end, flowed into a freezing of the financial power and into the ruin of the banks and financial institutions. 
It was a group of the republican representatives who allowed to fail the last week the first attempt to the arrangement. 
Since the democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of the societies should be protected in distress only by the government and not be bought, one thinks to the dead end escaped. 
To round the points of view for everything in the congress, one has also added a possession which says that, if the government with this program should do within five years of losses, she can raise then new taxes to get back thus her used capital. 
The new plan intends the payment of the first sum of 250 billions to which other 100 billions can come, if the president looks at it about necessary. 
The payment of other 350 billions must be dismissed in a renewed vote by the congress. 
As a countermove for his help Washington receives shares in the supported enterprises which introduce dividends in him in the case of profits, and which can resell it if the storm has passed. 
The Federal Government will have the possibility, the Pf�ndungsverfahren with regard to the apartments which are bound to the real estate loans affected by this plan, to detain, and to settle, in addition, terms for the repayment and the compensations which are paid to the leading employees of the affected enterprises. 
The developers of the plan would have it with pleasure that the representative's chamber already votes today about him, and the senate then on Wednesday. 
In spite of all her efforts is not sure yet that her plan will get green light. 
Yesterday really other voices rose against this plan, to sides of the Republicans as well as the democrats. 
` Quite obviously Washington does not understand us ', explained the Republican Scott Garett, member of the finance committee of the chamber, to his voters. 
` Yes, we have a big financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not they who consists in asking the taxpayers to the cash '. 
The democratic representative Brad Sherman, leader of a group in the congress which is called ` of the Kaukus of the sceptics ' shows the things differently, however, comes to the same conclusion. 
` 400 excellent economic professors, under it three Nobel Prize Laureates, have written to us to to inform us: We ask the congress not to let put under pressure, and to consider carefully which way is to be smashed ', yesterday he explained. 
At the same time we got in Europe once more the proof that it concerns a worldwide crisis. 
At an emergency meeting three Benelux lands announced the partial nationalization of the bank group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary, after French bank BNP Paribas announced that she refused to buy up her competitor who is in big difficulties, since she has lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis by the risky real estate loans in the United States. 
Fortis occupies 85,000 persons and belongs to twenty biggest European banks and ten biggest insurers. 
' This is no lost money, yesterday explained Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos. 
To the balance we receive a franchise and influence in the bank. 
This is exactly that what the savers and house holds estimate, now there itself unsafe times announce. ' 
During this time the British government was about on the other side of the English Channel just to nationalize another of the financial crisis in distress brought bank. 
According to the English press the government would take over all running loans at the bank Bradford and Bringley, from it more than 41 billions (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans. 
Yesterday Spanish bank Santander announced that it bought up the branches and the customer accounts of the British bank. 
Bradford and Bringley would be after Northern a rock the second bank which must nationalize the British government since beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (19252008) - death of an engaged icon 
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump, nobody would say, his weakness. 
Had the American actor with the winning smile of the narcissistic mirror escaped? 
Yes and. 
His sensitiveness, his sensitivity and an evident talent have kept away him probably also from a power position which brings the really terrible monsters to the world. 
But what of the big long-term runners! 
On Friday at the age of 83 years as a result of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut late Paul Newman one of the last icons of the American cinema of the years golden to him remains. 
He was less monumental than Brando which he resembled and for which he for a long time a kind of rival on the canvas was certainly also more breakable, more carefully in his play, besides, but just an apostle of the freedom and the Sprengens of dramaturgical conventions. 
Mixed blood often proves miraculous children. 
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as a son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother. 
From his European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream should originate. 
Without excessive ego, extreme high-class sign. 
Since in him a whole land was reflected again which was in love in the Self-made-man, in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific war in the battle which studied dramatic art in Yale in the beginning of the 50s and visited then the Actor's studio in New York, before he had success in the theater, on television and soon also in the cinema. 
Just this man who fought for the civil rights was also the driver who became in 1979 with the 24-hour running of Mans of seconds, and, in addition, a sex symbol, although he lived together with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a showing respect. 
With him also there disappear the unknown facets this mysterious, reserved, engaged and compared with the glamor of the show business to oversensitive stars whose riddle one will completely never solve. 
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word. 
The death Paul Newmans moved the film lovers this week-end into dizziness, while on the dark screen of the recollections all his big roles were played. 
More than half a century of the American cinema in constant change passes with him. 
There the winning cowboy from " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid " (1969) crowds again in the memory, and the young man who rejects his sensuous woman (Elizabeth Taylor) in the cat on the hot metal roof which was filmed in 1958 from Tennessee Williams. 
The recollection dating back much shorter (1990) is roused which did not fulfil all her promises to his sensitive Mr. Bridge who is disturbed in his old age by a wedding. 
So there was a lot of other Paul Newmans in the course of the history. 
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a handful of mud) from Robert Wise, a role which was intended for James Dean after whose death was taken up again and announced the Newman in 1956 properly. 
This likeable crook in the overriding The Sting (chief attraction) who was distinguished in 1973 with the Oskar for the best film. 
As a bitter and revengeful billiards player in the miraculous The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), 
This face by the times through, this was he. 
Still he. 
In his life epochs join. 
The youth knows him above all from the cult film Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), as a Reggie Dunlop, the a little orthodox coach of a hockey team. 
His fans found again him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of brothers Coen. 
With the last role in 2003 as a godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes the circle shut. 
In contrast to several film legends which have withdrawn early enough from the film world Newman should remain long in the saddle, and betray, besides, Hollywood, his property, his splendor and his concessions. 
The French film-maker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge in the 'Underplaying' when he judged his much too very expressive achievements. 
The profession was not always light for the nice Paul Newman to whom the roles flew for a long time only so. 
Nevertheless, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: Neurotiker, alcoholic, creeps or desperate with which perfect representation he reflected his slipping and his backlash. 
As a director revealed Newman unknown sides of his true sensitive sensitivity. 
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a subtle women's portrait of full melancholy. 
He who lost his son Scott by an overdose dedicated to this in 1984 his film Harry and Son, a work full sensitiveness and sadness. 
With the flood of honor which poured forth yesterday about Newman explained his narrow friend and earlier weapon companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid) seized extremely: ` His present has improved my life and this land. ' 
Generosity and joy of life were essential qualities of the late actor. 
Now apart from his legendary career a big advocate of the civil rights, the environment protection and the independent cinema, an opponent of the leeways of Hollywood also goes, there. 
We saw him standing probably often with the foot in bowls fully Vinaigrette, in sauces, pastry or other food, and this for quite tasteless held, although we found it in the beginning still amusing. 
The profits from his turnovers still flowed into his endowment for children in need. 
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman been involved up to the shot. 
He left to his five daughters a letter with these sentences: ` Always and to completely in the end your father was incredibly thankfully for his good star. 
It was an honour to may be here. ' 
And for us it was allowed to pursue an honour, the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor. 
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and in the farthest sense. 
extraction failed 
On the 8th October the negotiations begin in the criminal trial against J�nos surcharge and his accomplices. 
In particular the participation in the organized crime, as well as roughly careless damage and commercial deception, and other punishable actions - is accused of the defendants, among the rest, document forgery. 
According to public prosecutor's office the means lukrierten from the advertisings were used for own purposes, while the produced achievements were often covered with phoney calculations. 
State money and subsidies of the self-government - all together HOOF 65 Mil. - should have flowed partly into the cashes of organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the private cashes single. 
As the inquiry authorities announced, fictive calculations were presented while covering the advertising money, and the associations should also not have followed to her duties. 
According to indictment a large part of the calculations should have been faked. 
The calculation blocks were bought in the market from J�zsefv�ros, one let the round seals make in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision on it on which companies the calculations should be issued was decided on that tour to the north of flat lake on which Istv�n Lados was sent by J�nos surcharge. 
In the course of this "investigation tour" Lados pensions and restaurants should find. 
He required calculations about the Konsumationen to be able to issue calculations for the youth ministry and sports ministry, the Ministry of social security and Department of Employment, as well as the self-government of Budapest later on these presentations based. 
These calculations should go by the majority from Istv�n Lados and his accomplice, Andr�s? have been manipulated ri and should have been responsible latter according to our information for the constitution of the suitable reports. 
One of the purposes of Lados' "investigation tour" was a beer bar. 
How two calculations issued by Zuschlag und Co in 2003 is to be taken, the catering trade company should have entertained the 90-headed group of the association Biztos Pont Egyes�let. 
Now, however, the boss of the company brags, a so big group would not have fitted all at once into the bar. 
Another calculation, issued in summer, 2002 on the endowment Working J�v? �rt, later famously than Egy�tt a Harmadik �vezred�rt, showed likewise serious form and contents mistakes. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj which orders merely more than three rooms and can accommodate no more as ten persons at the same time 130 guests should have stayed according to calculation. 
No borders were put apparently also to the imagination of the calculation forgers when it was about the Pigal Kft., a catering trade company, in accounting documents of customers Jobb J�v? �rt and Hopp� only do not appear according to accusation authority at all. 
How manager Gy? z? Farkas hvg.hu informed, was clear to him immediately that it concerned phoney documents when documents were presented to him of the public prosecutor's office during questioning. 
" Our company name and the tax number were right on the stamp wrong ". 
And further: Apart from form mistakes the fact was also wrong that the company should have accommodated 100 persons, after they have a total of eleven rooms which offer place impossibly so to many persons. 
Also catering has been stated on the calculation, besides, the restaurant is since longer time no more in company. 
The industrious calculation forgers have also neglected to check that from them in the visor taken Budapester travel agency offers exclusively traveling abroad, and thus they have given Hungary traveling on the cash payment calculation what likewise contradicted the calculation lapping practise of the company. 
How in the course of the inquiries became known, in addition, they have stated on the calculations also the value added tax, although the travel agency achievements which refer to a land beyond the EU are free of value added tax. 
The height of the value added tax was all together on four of hotel R�vf�l�p Kft to the endowment Working J�v? �rt to issued calculations wrong, because the company instead of 25 only 15 percent of VAT settles, in addition, are issued by the employees exclusively machine calculations, nevertheless, the phoney documents were handwritten. 
Another mistake which had occurred the "Rechnungslegern" was him that they had bragged in a case "goods transport" as a produced achievement, although this is not offered by the company specified on investment consultation, informed the public prosecutor's office. 
To other form mistakes - wrong calculation format, wrong stamp - was to be owed, that in Egy�tt a Harmadik �vezred�rt Alap�tv�ny, as well as in XXI. Sz�zadi Kultur�lis Egyes�let and Biztos Pont to issued calculations as forgeries could be exposed. 
Also to never have issued the calculations in case of the Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfeh�rt� whose managers protested. 
Another "mistake" has occurred the forgers with the HIB Kft. from Ny�regyh�za: This society was at the time (2001) since just in resolution when the group of the Fiatal V�ros�rt Egyes�let should have eaten there - consequently the mass governor indicated not to have issued the calculations independently. 
Consciously phoney 
The other group him Calculation-casually are persons, to those was absolutely aware that they would have to lay fictive calculations. 
On request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj� Szocialist�k has the endowment Es�ly Budapest�rt Alap�tv�ny calculations for the endowment Egy�tt a Harmadik �vezred�rt, at a height of possibly HOOF 4 Mil. issued. 
According to indictment the manager of the Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy�rfi, to the exhibit of the fictive calculations. 
The biogate at the moment likewise located in liquidation Kft. also should go with Zuschlag und Co. have cooperated: In 2003 the Ltd should the endowment Working J�v? �rt Alap�tv�ny, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyes�let and V�r�sfeny? Egyes�let with phoney calculations in the total value of HOOF 5 Mil. have supplied which referred to not produced achievements. 
However, there were just as few payments, because the calculations were cancelled immediately after her exhibit what the affected persons in her documents, nevertheless, have forgotten to note. 
The third group him encloses Calculation-casually persons who are associated immediately with the defendants. 
One of them is Iv�n Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian manager the delta Tri� Kft., one in Budapest to resident, there, nevertheless, not discoverable fuel and vehicle business enterprise. 
This company should have issued in the period December, 2005 several calculations about the sales of EDP components in the total value of HOOF to about 18 Mil. 
According to inquiry authority located Cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas should have acted since the 14th September, 2005 in liquidation as a buyer of these calculations. 
Manager of this company was a Rumanian to whom the company documents should be likewise blocked by Iv�n Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information Kubatov has stood during the inquiries, calculations in the name of the Ltd. to have taken the money to the associations Atlasz and Hopp�, as well as in Egy�tt a Harmadik �vezred�rt Alap�tv�ny issued and their equivalent independently. 
Companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft as well as the Jos investment Bt. should have been founded by Roumanian bricklayers on Iv�n Kubatovs explicit wish there. 
Nevertheless, in truth none of these companies was active what lay according to defendant with lacking orders. 
Still he could profit from the enterprises: On request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente who was instructed with the preparation of the company foundation documents he has exhibited in the name of the proficient calculations to the associations associated with surcharge, as for example in Atlasz and Y-Gener�ci�. 
All together Kubatov should have issued 15 calculations in the total value of HOOF 14.2 Mil. in the name of companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri�, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations. 
The public prosecutor's office assumes from the fact that Kubatov could have collected in each case 10% of the amount payable as well as the value added tax. 
Kubatov should have abused even company Szi-Beri Bt for the exhibit of fictive calculations - in this case the calculations were added to the applications by Biztos Pont. 
Company Y-Gener�ci� and Sz�vets�g a Modern Magyarorsz�g�rt have delivered in January, 2006 her applications at the charitable organization of the socialist party, T�ncsics Mih�ly Alap�tv�ny ("TMA"). 
Both received 500,000 Forint, have used these amounts, nevertheless, misappropriated. 
To cover up this, they have presented the TMA five fictive calculations of the Works to team Kft. 
These calculations were guaranteed, by the way, by the search of the office from � rp�d Kemecsei in the teaching ministry. 
Now at the negotiations it is calculated by some defendants with a confession about the approach of the calculation forgery, as they were already filed before the public prosecutor's office. 
A sensation could be, if main defendant J�nos surcharge decides on a comprehensive confession. 
His present information was specified since less, and although he had already accepted several times to report extensively about everything, his confession is still pending. 
The question stays open whether this lies in his interest whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the reparation of the large part of the resulted damage of HOOF 50 Mil., and whether surcharge is ready as a countermove to take over the responsibility. 
However, it is absolutely possible that surcharge plays now the "offended", after his requests had bumped into alleviation of the arrest and house arrest on deaf ears. 
While the other criminals who have far arranged bigger damage with economic offenses and have not compensated for this, at large or stand at least under house arrest, surcharge remains this possibility kept. 
The psychology of the �berbietens - or why we are ready to pay more 
With auctions the buyers incline to be economical more and to overrate the offered for sale therefore. 
Now neurologist and economic researchers of the university of New York has succeeded it in discovering the neuro-logically-economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior. 
According to one in the "Science" magazine Published study the people want to be not hit in a competition, as for example of an auction on eBay, and are ready, therefore to pay even banked prices. 
The researchers have tried to explore the neuro-logical pattern of this "play" with experimental auctions. 
A group of the volunteers should play lotto, while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the test persons were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). 
With both plays the participants could win money, indeed, a raised activity of the Striatum, a complex was measured below the cerebral cortex, with losers of the auction at which outbidding the opponent plays an essential role. 
Beside many other functions this brain region is responsible for the "selfreward" of the nervous system. 
Hence, the researchers meant, the price increase can be explained by the avoidance of an over-reaction of the Striatums. 
To underpin her thesis, the small farmers have done investigations to the postpursuit of the money in the research group, in addition. 
In this case three groups should cooffer against a partner under different conditions. 
The true value of the product was informed of the control group, then they have done her applications. 
In addition, 15 dollars of reward were promised to another group, for the case that they arise as a winner from the play. 
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction which were likewise lost in case of a lost play. 
The difference between both groups merely consisted in the fact, that the stress with one on the profit, while lay with the others on the losing. 
However, as a proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists the members were ready " against the losing " playing group for higher applications, than that in Controlling one or the "Gewinn" group. 
" These results can be derived from no earlier economic theory. 
These have since the behaviour patterns observed at auctions up to now only with the joy at the profits, or the risk avoidance reasonably. 
The contradiction between these both theories was dissolved thanks to the picture-giving neuro-logical procedures, so that we have now the third explanation ready " - Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic faculty of the university of New York meant. 
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to be visited? 
Worldwide suffer around half a billion people from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver illness is listed under the leading causes of death. 
The number of the infected is estimated in this country at hundred thousand, however, only 7000 are treated what is due to the fact that the patients often do not know that they are infected. 
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver illnesses released by different viruses. 
The symptoms are often similar - hepatitis and jaundice are frequent, indeed, the causes and the illnesses differ of each other. 
According to cause the hepatitis viruses in two different kinds spread: with hepatitis A and E by the digestive tract (for example, by dirtied food or waters), with hepatitis B, C and D the viruses can be transferred by blood and other body liquids (as for example sperm, dissolution secretion or saliva). 
A vaccination is recommended to traveler against the viruses A and B, in any case, against the virus C there is no vaccine. 
The symptoms with hepatitis A appear about two three weeks after consumption of the dirtied Lebensmittels and are accompanied generally by unwell-being, weakness, stomachaches and nausea. 
Then the jaundice on the skin and in the eyes appears, the chair is getting light, the urine darkly, and the recovery can last up to during two three weeks. 
Worldwide about 1 Mil. people dies yearly in of hepatitis B to released, far heavier illnesses like liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. 
Principal reason for this is that estimates is according to only every tenth infected in medikament�ser treatment. 
Also hepatitis C can have serious results: untreated it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. 
Most infected not even know about her illness, because the cause destroys the liver cells perfidiously - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years. 
Hence, timely preventing, as for example regular controlling investigations, is essential. 
There are three groups in which this illness seems more often: that which have undergone before 1991 of a blood transfusion, drug dependent, and tattooed. 
Nowadays the number is estimated in chronic hepatitis C ill worldwide at 200 Mil. 
Because the illness is already provable with a routine lab investigation, it is advisable to visit the family doctor with the first signs of unknown origin. 
On time recognized, the illness is remediable which can be exterminated virus by which the infection danger is banished and the origin by cancer is bent forward. 
30th September is the world day of hepatitis, in 2004 for the first time from patient's representations worldwide organized. 
The purpose of the action is to strengthen the consciousness for this chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, her origin and the meaning of the early diagnosis. 
Believers have less pains? 
How the newest research results prove that the religious faith works like a kind of "painkiller" which should already have made easier the death of Catholic martyrs. 
Scientists Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It was examined, to what extent the faith in God influences the pain feeling of the person, the British sheet of "telegraph" announced. 
In the course of the rather weird investigation received 12 believers and atheists electroshock therapies, while they studied a painting of the mother of God. 
As the results pointed, the believers could switch off the large part of pains. 
By means of a Brain-scan technology could be even proved that the Catholics could activate the part of her brain which is responsible for the pain regulation. 
The investigation was first in a research project in which beside scientists also philosophers and theologians of different departments of the university take part. 
With the attempt a sparkling device was bound the test persons to the left hand which delivered the electroshock therapies. 
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly upon two paintings: On the one hand, a picture of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17-th century, and to the other Leonardo there Vincis " lady with the ermine ". 
The researchers hoped that the sight of virgin Maria would cause a kind of religious trance among the believers, while they selected there Vincis picture because it barely differed from the other painting and than was felt reassuringly. 
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in a scanner MRI, and received a total of 20 electroshock therapies in four stages in this time, while they should look either at the religious, or at the other painting. 
The Catholics reported, they would have felt at the sight of the mother of God " in security ", as if they were "looked", and they would have felt " rest and peace ". 
During the Betrachtens of the religious painting they have reported more than 12% less pains, as if they had Leonardos work with eyes. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias who likewise took part in the attempt meant, one could cause similar effects also with other, very active pictures also in the atheists, one would have to find only the suitable photo. 
" We would have to find a picture which releases very positive sensations, as for example a mother or a father ", according to the psychologist. 
Anglican bishop Tom Wright greeted the results of the research. 
" Carrying out the belief should change our personality, and does it also in many cases ", according to Wright. 
After these excellent results only the question remains which effect a Madonna's picture Leonardos or another comparable painter on the pain regulation of the believers would have. 
Would qualitatively high-quality virgin Maria still become better results achieve? 
You are of what you inform about yourself 
On the occasion of her tenth birthday Google with jointing and right can state: it is to be found in the pockets of the people just, how over her heads in the sky: She knows where the people have spent her vacation to which specialists they go, and what she moves. 
And with it not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the managers of Google. 
In the direction of the sceptics who are tormented by Orwellschen horror visions he allows to aim: These would overlook precisely the essentials of the web 2.0. 
In an interview with the Financial Times Schmidt meant recently, the principal purpose of Google is to collect even more personal data about the users and to get closer thus to the original objective of the company after which they " all information of this world order " wants. 
Schmidt explained, Google is after ten years of world-changing work still only at the beginning of the information-collecting. 
Asked after the status Quo in five years Schmidt meant: he wished, Google would be able, should do questions like " What I tomorrow? " or " Which job really fits to me? " to answer, indeed, software programs are not yet in the position in addition, because they would not know enough about the users. 
Not all Internet users are about that in the clear that in the course of her Internet searches the search words would be registered, as well as also the IP addresses from which was searched, and the visited sides. 
For example, "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows to the visitor to store his own searching course and to fall back later on it, so that the hits can be generated later much more exactly, and on the same logic the so-called "Recommendations" with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services on account of the earlier preferences are also based. 
However, the users ask themselves what happens in case of a data abuse - " If one looks what I do " - some are concerned whether of the Google-data mono pole. 
Nevertheless, in most cases it is rather the potential power represented by the company which looks horrific, and less the feeling of guilt or the fear of punishment, the striving for freedom or the clamour against the power which bumps with many Internet users into refusal. 
However, it is a proved fact that the search words not only are stored, but are transmitted in the occasion case also into three parts, and in these law cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user. 
A prime example for this was recently the action against P�dophilie in Brazil in the course of whose Google of the Brazilian government handed information which was collected by the communal site called "Orkut" and also allowed an identification of the P�dophilien. 
However, around personal rights concerned users could draw a deep breath still in May when Google moved together with civil right organization EFF successfully against the FBI in court: therefore, Google can be also made in future with no point of the constitution publish information to the FBI on confidential inquiry. 
(Indeed, the Federal Government has obtained successfully the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search words with reference to the protection of children and young people law adopted years ago, indeed, became to her the list of the single users, or keep their web and search word list for two months retrospectively.) 
Googles image remains controversial: Those which publish her personal data reluctantly because they fear the loss of her private sphere and intimate sphere by the use of the Google services castigate the enterprise with the outrage being due presenting to the conservatively companies. 
Meanwhile sees the American "Geek culture" which is present in many lands and eager computer fans, activist and user unites, which the next generation of the " cool enterprisers " in them, in contrast to Microsoft which is a market leader thanks to Windows, even if both fight for the same purpose. 
A possible reason for this is that Google demands of his users in contrast to Microsoft no identification codes, and makes available his services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be cooler far attractive, more in a juvenile manner and, than the official methods of the software giant. 
On the other hand, the Geeks the problematic relation of the personal rights and the Internet look though shrewdly - a relation which has moved in particular during the past years thanks to the concept " web 2.0 " in the center. 
With the " web 2.0 " it is since about nothing else than speak around collaboration, the users leave intentionally tracks and use the available communication canals, and also if the magnitudes are different individually, the central issue remains the same to be public since. 
An average youngster can administer at the same time on several communal main entrances his profile - from Facebook via Xanga, this can by means of other services, as for example Twitter, or music services like last.fm with each other connect, and can integrate all this, in the end, into a postpursuit system as for example FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead Blogs which show the newest photo galleries automatically which are geocontinual on Flickr or Picasa. 
And a row of other exemplary cases proves: While looking the party photos of the last night the friend soon finds out with whom her disloyal friend has enjoyed himself, or the employee will dismiss because he gives vent in his Blog only much too honestly to his annoyance about the enterprise guidance - one is sure: The concept "Private sphere" was interpreted meanwhile totally anew. 
Who leads an on-line life, is that what he reveals of himself - thus in possibly one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of the today's youth. 
And who tries to keep secret something, or to handle even the Google monopoly, this can act with pleasure - as for example with Scroogle, a tool which accesses, indeed, the searching machine of Google leaves, indeed, intentionally no tracks. 
Not few people do not register intentionally on communal sides, so that they are not discoverable, but also the on-line applications of Google, as for example word processing and graphic tools and RSS-Feeds, can handle with alternative versions which are bound to no gigantic server parks and do not generate, hence, also the best possible profile of the user. 
The public opinion waits meanwhile fascinatedly for it, to Google her true face points. 
With her present value of 156 USD of Bn. the enterprise lies even before IBM (140 USD of Bn.), the income of the advertising agencies threatens Intel (124 USD of Bn.) or Coca Cola (110 USD of Bn.), the advertising surfaces of AdWords/AdSense, and the faster and faster introduced services prepare not only Microsoft, but also to other software developers brainwork. 
However, critical viewers also find the disconcerting counterpoles: Thus possibly the group management has totally rejected a protest of the employees, after the fees of kindergarten belonging to companies were doubled, in addition, the management thought, the repeated catering of the employees is too costly. However, all that seems virtually mildly against the fact that Google went in 2006 before the Chinese government even to the knees and agreed with an arrangement, after which all regime-critical hits, or those which would be filtered out against the good taste expelled. 
The internal regulation of the group is that in Ahead no new service is promoted, but only if this is also quite available. The events of the coming months and years could still turn up something again hard: During some mean, Googles book mass and project Magazinscan or archiving project supposes meanwhile magnitudes that the enterprise soon had to argue with the uppermost court of law, are disturbed other rather because of the system "Health" which allows the production of a complete health profile on the basis of findings, doctors and problems. 
And the Sci Financial Accounting authors already the material - possibly "Scroogled" delivers the fact that Google builds up a genetic data bank to the next generation, famous Roman von Cory Doctorow describes in the best orwellschen manner a future in which a person becomes alarmingly close-cash thanks to data referring by Google. 
Two youngsters help the double murderer from � zd in the trace removal 
Now in connection with the double murder from � zd the police has interrogated two youngsters who are in the suspicion to have helped with the removal of the tracks, informed the speaker of the police commissioner's office Borsod on Tuesday. 
The youngsters were confessedly, nowadays they are accused to the social security. 
According to the information news agency MTI it concerns two girls who defend themselves at large. 
Social security is threatened with a term imprisonment from up to five years. 
The suspect of the double murder from � zd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken on Sunday in pretrial detention. 
The man is under urgent action suspicion to have murdered several persons from avarice deliberately. 
In the course of the inquiries has turned out that the 23-year-old to a 53-year-old had owed a bigger monetary amount. 
Nevertheless, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, hence, he lured his believer on the last Wednesday on an area in � zd where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter. 
According to the MTI the man has planned the action of long hand - this also proves the fact that he has committed the murders with a weapon hidden in the scene. 
Now together with experts the police examines the action weapon as well as the circumstances of her use. 
Warsaw stock exchange lays purchase offer for Prager stock exchange 
The Warsaw stock exchange has offered about 200 Mil. euros, or 5 Bn. Czech crowns for the hundred percent purchase of the blocks of shares of the Prager stock exchange. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw stock exchange, confirmed the offer which the Poles in spite of the fact had laid that they were excluded earlier from the Czechs than possible owners of her stock exchange. 
Reason for the fact is that the Warsaw stock exchange totally belongs to the state. 
99% of the stocks is in the hands of the Polish state which wants to dispose, however, more than of 60% of the papers during the coming months. 
By announcements of the Czech newspaper "E15" contain the offer of the Poles the purchase price highest up to now which was offered for the Prager stock exchange. 
As the newspaper announces, till present the Viennese stock exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, New York have laid floor Exchange, the London stock exchange and the German stock exchange offers. 
Petr Koblic, boss of the Prager stock exchange said the last week that from all prospective customers the Warsaw stock exchange was probably the worst new owner, and he also did not exclude that in future could lead even to closing the Prager stock exchange. 
Market experts estimate the value of the Prager stock exchange at 5-10 Bn. crowns. 
According to agreement of the stockholders 90% of the stocks could be sold. 
The biggest owner of the Prager stock exchange is the Patria Finance investment bank with a 25-percent participation, followed by the Cesk� Sporitelna bank with 14.7 and the tiger holding company Four S.a.r.l with 13.5 percent. 
The financial crisis from the point of European newspapers 
In her comments dedicated the further tapering to a point international financial crisis some leading European sheets spoke on Tuesday already from " second 11th September ". 
We have to owe the global finance disaster to the American president, possibly "La Repubblica" thought - the president has not even been able, his own party for the law draft behind itself to one which should bring some relief in the frightening situation... 
Instead of a " new Pearl Harbor ", as investor Warren Buffett heavy to billions called it, it would be right to speak from " second 11th September ". 
Parts of the press in Madrid locate the scapegoat likewise in Washington. 
In the opinion of "El Mundo" the missing political guidance is responsible at the fact that the world economy is now on the edge of the breakdown. 
The American financial system threatens to break down more and more, and under it the whole world will suffer. 
Indeed, Bush's plan was not perfect, now, however, the danger threatens after the vote in the congress that Washington has no political means to the crisis management ready. 
The world economy hangs in the air, namely precisely at a time, because one of the biggest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place. 
One leaves the menace no more except Eight, thinks possibly the Genevan "day indicator". 
Indeed, some states could still make available rescue parcels to her financial institutions advisable in staggering, and save the banks with the money of the taxpayers before the bankruptcy. 
If a domino effect is released, however and even more banks go broke, then help neither other injections of capital, nor other immediate measures. 
In the long term the EU member states about her shade would have to jump and centralize the control of the monetary markets. 
Only on Monday more than 100 EUR of Bn. were paid out to schw�chelnde financial institutions, reminds the Viennese " the standard ". In addition, according to the newspaper further, the doubts are more and more realistic that now also the European taxpayers a little more deeply in her pockets would have to reach for the Americans to come out of the crisis. 
Up to now the EU has not seriously argued with the crisis which sweeps now like a Tsunami above the old continents. 
Indeed, the "rescuers" would not have to "wave" immediately several hundred billion euros, however, it would be advisable to stick in which case it would be reasonable to touch the money of the taxpayers to turn away a still bigger damage. 
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee 
What would be the best method of the development of new technologies on the accident avoidance, if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from the nature? 
For example, those of the bees. 
With the CEATEC in Japan an astonishing project with which the Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees with the creation new accident of avoiding systems was introduced. 
In collaboration with the Tokioter university Nissan has built the biomimetische system steered by autorobots of the type BR23C, a mini-car, equipped with the qualities of the bees, with the purpose to support the development of a system which avoids any collisions. 
In the flight every bee forms her own, oval "private area" which is very similar to our own "shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, with the exhibit. 
Besides, the compound eye of the bee which can see in every direction and in a corner of more than 300 degrees plays an important role. 
To copy the function of the compound eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-steered distance knife. 
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates her distances and sends signals to the microprocessor in Board which initiates immediately the collision-avoiding process. 
The obstacle is registered in split seconds, and the autorobot changes immediately the course, like the movement of the bees, while he turns the tyres around the suitable corner. 
In contrast to present systems this manoeuvre takes place purely instinctively. 
" If it was not in such a way, the autorobot could not react fast enough to make way to the obstacles ", explained Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of "Mobility Laboratory" and the autorobot-project. 
The system must react instinctively and immediately, because this technology corresponds to the most internal and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents count nowadays still as inevitable. 
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees if they make way to other bees. 
And this must run off in the fraction of one second. 
Indeed, the elusiveness, in contrast to the bees, not can occur up, down, or even diagonally - it can be two-dimensional only, namely only in the direction of the Wendbarkeit of the tyres. 
While many possibilities are open to the bees here endlessly to make way to other bees, the researchers could help themselves with the autorobot only of the rotary movement, or the acceleration and Abbremsens. 
The BR23C contains lithium-polymer batteries which are light and more energy-efficient, and, hence, have a longer life span, than customary lithium-ion batteries. 
Andoh explained, it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of the data, and still less on the ability on storing this. 
This device must process per second merely some input and react accordingly to them. 
It must not store this, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction with the help of earlier manoeuvres, so that it takes up constantly only a handful of KB Memory. 
It requires no heavy to gigabyte and memo ream heavy to megabyte. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology which will be according to appraisal of Nissan within the next ten years serially in production. 
An other application could find the technology with the satellite navigation GPS, while it steers the driver consciously round obstacles and leads him thus in the purpose. 
A name for the sin-expensive child 
Now the written version of the 700Mrd dollar of heavy rescue parcel-law is which shall be applied in several stages and is aimed at the buying of the bad loans of the banks. 
In the first passageway half of the money should be given. 
By a meeting which came to an end on Saturday after midnight local time east coast the congressional representatives have brought after debates of several days to an arrangement on the 700-billion dollar of heavy rescue parcel, announced Reuters. 
" We have achieved essential progress ", said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the American chamber of deputies, and meant, one must only write down the arrangement. 
Both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain supported the achieved compromise about the rescue parcel. 
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson meant about the result: The program will show effect and it becomes efficient, however, one must act even more. Here according to Pelosi it would be not about the rescue the embankment Street, but therefore, the oar of the economy rumzurei�en. 
The written version of the parcel was still published before the opening of the Asian markets, thus, Washington time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), however, has released no high-altitude flight on the stock exchanges. 
On Monday the chamber of deputies about the law draft votes first to the stabilization of the economy of 2008, then the senate is in the row. 
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday evening with Pelosi, and also the White House greeted the news about the arrangement. 
We are contented with the at night achieved progress and estimate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House. 
However, the program deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush's administration after which the 700 Bn. dollars should be spent all at once on the buying more decayed, with loans of loaded securities. 
In the first Tranche half of the 700-billion amount should be given at most and 250 Bn. are available immediately, after the congress will vote as expected on Monday about the Causa. This sum should be used for the buying of loan-loaded, bad securities, and the president should decide on the other 100 Bn. USD. 
The program is checked by own committee to which also the president of the Federal reserve belongs. 
Other half of the 700 Bn. depends on an other decision of the congress. 
For the purposes of the law the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactics: It can do at the same time bad loans, mortgages, and with mortgages loaded securities buy, or also other "toxic" loans. 
As responsible persons of the ministry reported, the buying can occur in an auction, as well as directly. 
The law enables to the affected companies to take part in an insurance program with which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the alarming means, and which pay enterprise to the damages to be expected suitable fees. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means in such a way that can be made available up to 700 Bn. dollars as an emergency relief for the American financial system, it is for the largely invested buying of bad means, her assurance, or the avoidance of a system risk which is released by the collapse of a bigger financial institution. 
We put the necessary steps, so that we are ready for the introduction of the law, as soon as it was signed, according to Paulson. 
However, the bosses in difficulties advisable and now on state help to instructed banks can calculate on the fact that her dispatches which are called in the oversea slang casually " Golden Handshake " are shortened by the government. 
There will be a shortening of the salaries only in certain cases, and these shortenings will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps out in each case. 
The shortening means in the essentials that if the ministry buys within the scope of an auction, thus the " Golden Handshake " is taxed, is pushed away unless, the retired bank boss in the pension. 
In case of a direct buying of the decayed loans the government will intervene aggressively to make sure that the manager's salaries are not exaggerated. 
To the picture also belongs that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions refer only to new arrangements, so that the more people take part in the program. 
This is the first case in the American history that shortenings are regulated on manager's salaries by law, commented democrat Barney Frank, chairperson of the finance committee, the measure. 
The state wins participation rights in the participant banks, so that the risk sinks for the taxpayers, because they can also take part, as soon as to the economy and with it also the saved bank is better again. 
The law draft intends that the president must present to the congress during the next five years a suggestion as the taxpayers should get back her lost money from the finance sector again. 
However, there was on both sides sceptic which have expressed her doubts in relation on the plan. 
This is not that what the American citizens expect from us, the plan on no account protects the money of the taxpayers, according to the California Republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur meant: The measures were sped up by the same persons who are also responsible for the collapse the embankment Street.

Press review of the German-speaking space 
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more self-confident within the camp - "Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria. 
In Austria Haider und Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition. 
Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the on-line issue of the German news magazine settled on the left Franz Walter analyzes the reasons of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article " revolution of Bavaria exterminates her fathers ". 
In the opinion of the famous political scientist the erosion of the CSU for a long time before began the sad baker's stone Huber duet his offices took over. 
The Christian-social have renewed Bavaria for decades - now just the modern citizens of them turn away. 
The epoch break is at the same time a problem of the Christian's democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel. 
Quite unexpectedly there did not come the disaster of the CSU, but on Sunday has come to an end a little bit what stood out, however, already quite precisely ten years ago: the indubitable hegemony of a state party 
Since already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU lands at 47.7 percent and fell with it for the first time since the fifties under the 50-percent brand 
This recurred three years ago with the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, thus still in the much quoted Stoiber's era. 
From the CSU in the federal state strictly pursued modernization has exterminated finally her own mothers and fathers. 
Sociologists had forecast already 40 years ago, besides, had misjudged, however, in the tempo considerably. However, without consequences the S�kularisierung, the educational success, the inflow of East Germans and North German in the prospering regions of Bavaria on the loyalty could not remain the CSU voter. 
Modernization always goes along with option increase. And this has political results. 
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and more unconventional. 
It is remarkable that during the last weeks almost the classical civil groups expressed the biggest distance to the CSU: the independent professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voter with school-leaving exam like Master's certificate. 
Here the support of the CSU on dropped even less than 40 percent. 
The press (diepresse.com) 
Who reports the conservative Viennese newspaper in theirs " with whom? Party chiefs cautiously in coalition questions " entitled article about the chaotic domestic position in Austria after the new elections. 
The SP� would like to negotiate with the �VP. 
The �VP forbids the interference of the SP� in internal affairs to itself. 
The BZ� appears in all directions openly for conversations, while the Greens do not want to commit themselves in relation to a coalition yet. 
The new elections are over, and now everything turns on the coalition; in the debates on the public law television the party chiefs barely showed up in her maps. 
SP� boss Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to want to negotiate with the �VP. 
The SP� wants to show that a collaboration of both parties is possible very well - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case. 
The question whether he could fancy then a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the present �VP boss as a vice chancellor, left open Faymann. 
As he said, the voters would have voted out of office the bowl Molterer course. 
A repetition of this direction would not be possible. 
Molterer has reacted meanwhile to red offers carefully. 
The collaboration cannot be fertile, he thought if Faymann tries to interfere with internal concerns of the �VP. 
Whether his party goes to opposition, or to the coalition, is absolutely open nowadays, and these questions should be discussed �VP-internal. 
BZ� boss J�rg Haider was open in all directions. 
" To prevent red-black, we are ready to take over responsibility of government ", according to Haider. 
J�r�ka: The vicious circle of the poverty and the Segregation must be broken through 
Today the European summit has begun in Paris to the equal opportunities which is aimed this year by the EU-council presidency land France. 
In her speech directed in the plenary meeting L�via J�r�ka, Fidesz-delegated of the European people's party drew the attention, in particular to the Bildungssegregation, because this is one of the most serious law breakings which happens Roma-Kindern, in addition, this is the biggest obstacle for their craving for recognition. 
The high-ranking conference was opened by the French occupation minister and social minister Xavier Bertrand in the name of the French council presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU commissioner for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
Among the participants representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most significant European legal protection organizations and civil organizations from the area were equal opportunities. 
As the press agency of the EP-delegated of the Fidesz announces, J�r�ka has drawn the attention to the fact, that beside discrimination with the job search which Roma would be edged out, primarily, because of her low educational level of the job market. 
" The prevailing majority Roma-Jugendlichen has no middle school education, and thanks to a bad basic school education only a small part can reach a Master's certificate " from them. 
Weiters stressed J�r�ka that education is a basic human right, to that a key role it would come up by the assertion of other human rights. 
The economy of the EU member states can strengthen investments in the untimely education of Roma-Kindern. 
In the opinion of the representatives it is important that of these connections a possibly wide circle - Roma and non-Roma - realizes. 
Since the earlier Roma Sch�ler begins the school, the stronger there rise his chances to become the productive member of the job market; and by income tax and sales tax they perform her contribution to the national issues. 
" As union citizens, the right on qualitatively high-quality education must be protected Roma - the bad and segregierte lessons must be put " - thus L�via J�r�ka. 
As the representative explained, a common, purpose-oriented and action-oriented action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the Desegregationsprozess on the educational sector. In addition the correct observance of the existing and planned Anti-discrimination directives is essential. 
" We must the vicious circle from poverty, Segregation, and break through unemployment and to Roma-Kindern give the democratic possibilities to contribute to the future of Europe as full-entitled citizens ", demanded J�r�ka. 
Since the congress in Berlin last year the summit is organized yearly with the purpose to create a unique forum for the prefixing of the purposes of the equal opportunities and discrimination freedom at European, but also national level, for the purposes of the " European year of the equal opportunities ". 
CSU: Mercy on time 
At the end of October it is decided on the destiny of the liked duet Huber-baker's stone 
In spite of the electoral debacle still no heads roll meanwhile, at the head of the Bavarian CSU the personnel debates were adjourned. 
Party chief Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein still remain in her offices, the question is only, how long this mercy lasts. 
On the destiny of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent vocal loss it is decided on the last October week-end with the extraordinary Party Congress. 
However, the a lot of scolded duet look though already let that it would not like to stick on her armchairs. 
With it they want to calm the angry faction and the party base which one day after the " Bavarian Tsunami " in view of the loss of the absolute majority personal consequences demanded. 
Five years ago - added, under the guidance of Edmund Stoiber standing in his career climax - the Christian-social union still reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, a year after the putsch against Stoiber they could protect only 43.4 percent of the voices. 
The CSU was during 46 years "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria which gains 18 percent of the German BIP. 
Indeed, the conservatives remain the decisive strength in the southern federal state also important for the Hungarian economy, however, will have to rule from now on in a coalition. 
As the first sign of the party-internal restructuring potential successor Hubers, vice-president and federal agrarian minister Horst Seehofer is also integrated into the investigation team which leads with the liberal FDP, or the legal-directed " free voters " exploratory discussions about a possible Munich coalition. 
It amounts to an irony of the destiny that with the list " free voters " that Gabriele Pauli come in the legislation whose anti-Stoiber appearance has used the Huber-baker's stone duet first to clear then the single-minded politician pitilessly. 
Now the CSU guidance concentrates all her forces upon the stabilization of baker's stone. 
In this transitional process will come up Stoiber who pulled up to now the threads from the background an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU-presiding called 28th September the " most bitter day of his political career ". 
On Monday Huber did a few toxic remarks in the direction of CDP - according to his view the CSU far have earned more support of the sister party. 
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat than one signal to the CDP and with it also to Angela Merkel. 
Should the CSU which has contributed in 2005 also at national level a lot to the success with a common strength act again on the legs not be put, Merkel after the elections to the Bundestag in September, 2009 cannot become again a chancellor. 
Merkel which has done no secret from her disappointment about the fiasco believes that the terrain loss of the CSU does not affect negatively the big coalition in Berlin. 
What is relative, however: The wounded CSU becomes not lighter be to be ruled, and the crisis of the social democrats goes on meanwhile. 
With 18.6 percent SPD reached her result best up to now in Bavaria since 1946. 
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0 
By the choices on Sunday no representative of the opposition has created it in the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers mean, this lies with the prosperity and stability in the land controlled by Alexander Lukashenko, however, the OECD supposes unlawful acts with the counting up of the voices. 
The OECD which has sent 450 observers from 43 lands has not recognized the choices. 
Indeed, De legislation of the 10-millions-inhabitant's state gets by since decades without opposition. Gathered opposition has still seriously expected itself under the name " combined democratic forces " (ODS) before the yesterday's choices that Lukashenko who renewed in 2006 his presidency mandate by the squalid choices and thanks to a constitutional amendment already for the fourth time would "admit" this time some representatives of the opposition in the parliament. 
Therefore, the ODS has forborn even from the before planned boycotts. 
The Ukraine becomes economically more and more dependent thanks to the rising prices with the natural gas import of Russia. For the relief of the prize increases even loans were taken up, and the land has also agreed to the disposal of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the land, to the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition there stood hope, the Ukraine wants to improve her relation with the EU, after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have entry ban because of the anti-democratically classified political system in the EU. 
The evaluation report of the choices of the OECD in which the stress lay rather on the positive movements, instead of on the defects - as for example the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates of the choices - provided for a passing relaxation. 
Indeed, the quick report of the OECD already on Monday criticized the campaign - therefore, members of the opposition might not seem in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition might not be present with the counting up of the voices. 
In spite of all that the opposition is capable of an improvement in the political system recognize: Political prisoners were put possibly on free foot, and Minsk is ready even for smaller confrontations with Moscow, while it was refused furthermore the recognition of the independence of the unfaithful Georgian provinces S�d-Ossetien and Abchasien, although Russia with which the Ukraine on the paper forms a F�derativstaat looks at both areas since one month as independent. 
" We have done two steps forward and backward, but the most important is that the dialog has begun between Byelorussia and the EU ", said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our sheet. 
In the opinion of the opposition candidate of the presidency choices of 2006 a continuation is desirable, although " have got the mighty fear to let even a member of the opposition in the parliament ". 
The opposition plans no protest measures in view of the results, but tries to make clear rather the necessity of an economic reform to the voters. 
" We have to fight here with many problems - the oppositional newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities lay stones in the way to us with the distribution, but still I see that more and more people support the change, even older " - Milinkewitsch said in allusion on the fact that the most-supported layer of the pensioners not even agrees with the Lukashenko's regime whose only salary is the production of social security. 
" Thanks to the indebtedness of the land and the increase of the commercial deficit it is only a question of the time to which to the silence of a cemetery reminding " social security " starts to crumble ", according to Milinkewitsch. 
In contrast to opposition politician Russian observers have called the choices democratic. 
Sergei Lebedev, leader of the mission of the community of independent states explained to news agency Ria Novosti: " The people believe the actions, and not the words ". Hence, the absence of the opposition is a proof of the maturity of the Belorussian voters. 
Brunetta: " From now it is had breakfast before the work " 
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are swivelling doors for the entrances and exits of the officials. 
From today the measure will come into force against them those smart alecks who only stamp and go then during the working hours coffee drinking. 
The new one? Today anti-slacker's law " was introduced by Renato Brunetta, the minister for public management and by Mauro Masi, secretary general of the presidium of the council of ministers. 
" 
" Now a new era of the responsibility and transparence begins. 
This is Reformismus ", underlines Brunetta once again. 
The installation ends with the Palazzo Chigi in all constructions of the presidium of the council of ministers. 
Masi means moreover: " the choice of the swivelling doors is also from big symbolically value ". 
From sides of the officials there was no opposition, assured the secretary general: " This process was supported by all, the collaboration came from all sides ". 
Now, all in all, there is no breakfast during the working hours more; end with Kaffe or croissant. 
Brunettas advises with respect to that with a smile: " A good cappuccino works at 7 o'clock miracle ". 
During a conference of the upper committee of the public management (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione) 
from Rome the minister announces that " within three months the absences of the officials have decreased to 50%, that is 60,000 persons per year are present more at the work ". 
He adds, it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public management of Italy 
" their Lohn-Dynamiken - according to the minister - were big during the last 8-10 years twice as as the private area and well over the inflation rate ". 
In the meantime, thousands of officials have got together to work against the Brunetta decree within the scope of the appeal supported by Codacons. 
" While the minister for the civil service distinguishes himself with figures about lower Absenzen at the work - the consumer's headquarters write - the people of the ' active slackers ' grow incessantly. 
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the civil service have got together to explain the war to the illegal norms of the decree. " 
In particular it is fought before the regional administrative court (TAR) for additional financial balances for working-conditioned illness; thus also become the planned extension of the obliging house arrest of the ill working-class taker during which controlling visits can be made and other aspects of the innovations of the minister contested. 
Napolitano: " Prevention against working accidents is vital " 
Every day 2500 working accidents happen in Italy, three persons die and 27 invalids remain in perpetuity. 
For 2007 the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm since that the deadly working accidents lay with approximately 1200. 
These figures cover seriousness of a phenomenon which causes almost twice as many deaths as by murders originate. 
Today the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will commit 58. national days for the victims of working accidents to steer thus the attention of the social institutions and media on this dramatic situation. 
" The alarming data widespread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm as determining the question of the prevention in the workplace is. ", the president of the republic Giorgio Napolitano confirms Pietro Mercandelli in his communication of the president of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro). 
The head of state expresses his " big esteem for the steady engagement to the prevention in the workplaces, for the protection of the injured workers, to the social security for the families of the victims and to the sensitization of the public opinion ". 
" An indignant "Basta" has rose here; understandably with the tragedies which, measured in her scale, some whirl in the media and condolence of the general public release. However, the everyday reality confronts us often with dramatic events which can even recur in her own dynamism ". 
Napolitano does not hide that " there is anyway also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information. " 
The numerous initiatives accept a special meaning for a straighter realization in school frame on the part of the youngsters who feed themselves to the professional life. 
It is our duty to direct the attention upon this phenomenon and not to change the subject from his social seriousness. One must bring into force a legislative norm and improve. 
On his part the president of the chamber Gianfranco Fini emphatically " how the phenomenon of the working-conditioned deaths has an urgent social emergency forms which offends the conscience of us to all and makes all institutions work towards determined rules which have the purpose to put an end " to the problem. 
" The data of the working accidents seem to signal a light improvement, however, this does not exclude that the number of the working-conditioned deaths is too high ", stresses president of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli. 
" We might not that this " positive trend " signifies less attention. Exactly this causes the tragedy at the end. " 
" As believe that one undertakes in reason not enough to walk towards the phenomenon of the accidents. One can fight by different actions against it. 
Stronger controls and inspections are necessary according to our opinion? so Mercandelli; but also the stronger measures to the clarification of the workers which begin already at school ". 
" An other strain is necessary - he subjoins - what concerns the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion. 
But above all a bigger sense of responsibility is asked by sides of the employers compared with a phenomenon which shows a social emergency ". 
Mercandelli also depended on it on the " progressive deterioration of the protection for the working accident victims " on speaking and prangerte the " abolition of the social system against which we fight during the last years ". 
" Consequently the purpose is to return a guarantee on assurance to the working-class taker, so that the destiny of the victim of a working accident does not become dependent on the voluntary or accidental donations which are decided by time at the moment from a legislator ". 
Mp3 player under accusation: Danger of hearing damages 
To hear sounds music for a longer time span with portable music devices, as for example Mp3 player, can lead to permanent auditory damages. 
The European committee which quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee about the topical and recently identified health risks) of the EU in a report widespread today in Brussels announces this. 
" From the report? thus one says in a remark? becomes clear that 5-10% that which hear loudly music with portable music devices during at least five years weekly longer than one hour during the day risk the lasting loss of her hearing ". 
" I am worried that such a big number of youngsters, the normally portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume put to know her hearing without it damage irreparably ", according to Meglena Kuneva. 
" From the scientific findings? thus one says on the part of the Eu? if a clear risk which presses to quick action appears. 
What really counts, it is to sensitize the consumers and to do this information about common property. 
We must check the quite existing controlling systems in view of this scientific knowledge again, so that they are absolutely actual and hold with the new technology step ". 
Brussels had instructed the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of the portable music devices among youngsters. 
" The scientists - so the communication of the EU closes - confirm that one is procured too surely and that the Eu will examine committee together with the other Eu members and the affected persons now the necessary measures, around children and youngsters better before the noise which comes from portable music devices and similar devices to be able to protect ". 
There exists at the moment already a European norm which limits the level of the noise of portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damages which could come from a too big noise load. 
One can limit these damages very much in which one reaches for solutions like the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise suspension. 
In her report, the Eu points out the scientific committee to the fact, that if the users from portable music devices only five hours the week loudly (more loudly than 89 decibels) hear music, so that the legal borders are already crossed which count with regard to the maximum noise level recorder in the job. 
Those which cross music this border risk the complete loss of the hearing within from five years. 
This would concern 5-10% of the users by such devices whose number on between 2.5 and 10 million persons can be estimated in the Eu.

The policy too often deals with the everyday problems and emergencies which appear every now and then. 
We, against it, want to have in view a longer period, around thus with in a deeper perspective seriously work on the development of Rome and the future of the town ". 
The chief burgomaster of Rome lays a lot of value to specify the following " This committee is neither an useless equipment, nor a wreck: she is absolutely free, it will cost the Roman citizens no cent and she will bring us to the reflection. She will occupy the best heads of the capital ". 
According to Alemanno " it is necessary to own a strategical plan which is neither hermetic nor static, around our town a high-class jump - which she really needs - to allow and to act thus a common step in the future ". 
A future, according to the chief burgomaster of Rome which limit themselves " not only in the topical municipal borders, but will look much further ", not only concerning the role of Rome than metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean Sea. " 
Obama? the first anti-American president? Here an explanation 
A known American politician whom a lot is anxious to be looked as independent has written: " Barack Obama becomes second anti-american a president. 
The first one was Jimmy Carter who decimated by his decisions, the economy of the USA and maintained with befeindeten Islam relations (and still today this acts as a private individual) ". 
The attacks against Obama become more and more violent, just now where the choices approach. 
A lady from Miami has written side on Internet: " This person is of full ambitions. 
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation which has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators! ". 
Nevertheless, actually, these attacks do not have to say a lot; it concerns racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; everything says that Obama with a big projection wins. 
Also in this case the people who speak with the heart and not with the head are there. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in theirs in the Editorial: only in the voting booth we will probably know whom the real American patriot will give his voice. 
Here appears a mentality of the USA which was held up to last hidden. 
" Says what you want, then we will decide for whom we will do our Kreuchen, whether for Obama or for McCain ". 
There are there the people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America. 
Something what one never before heard? only now where the success of the black candidate seems so sure. 
In any case, in spite of all these considerations, the final weapon for the democrats is George Bush. 
1500 persons were questioned: Which mistakes has Bush committed during his term of office? 89% have answered: the war in Iraq. 
America changes. 
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent with a step in the bottom again home. 
In Iraq 4500 soldiers have lost her life and the Americans became not constrained to pack. 
Nevertheless, Iraq remains the weak point of Bush for the majority. 
That which will take his place stands before a gigantic task. 
The USA. The financial breakdown leaves his tracks also with journalists: In the newspapers one can already feel the shortenings. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press. 
500 American journalists were questioned by the centre PEW Research about her situation and her mental control the future concerning. 
Today almost all journalists are pessimistically what her future it begins. 
Still they did not explain towards to him the information concerning responsible really anxiously because of the general credibility. 
They feel not so alone as earlier. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model which was destroyed. 
There the big problems come by the shortenings hitting the Newsroom, thus of the space in which the editors work to put together the newspaper. 
It concerns a problem which must be solved? so the interviewed journalists? if one wants to prevent that the traditional journalism, as the big audience understands him, shrinks not substantially. 
Today a clear, but complex pessimism fulfils the American journalist. 
Six of ten journalists and Executive of boss of the printing press are of the opinion that the journalism on national level on the wrong way is. 
In the local area these are with the Executives even to 65%. 
Printed versus Broadcast. 
It is not difficultly for the journalists to fancy itself to which direction the web goes. 
The most important publishing company groups make a way the way on the Internet which is looked by many as the "killer" of the printing press. 
The " economic pressure " which the journalists feel has risen around up to 79%. 
500 interviewed journalists have admitted wanting to join to the new technology, in hope " she brings something good for the journalism ". 
The biggest tear exists in the American journalism today between the editors in chief newsroom and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of the editors in chief on national level are sure, her reporters divide her values with them, while there are only 23% at local level. 
Some think, it has to act with the " security in the work ". 
The managers who have fear to lose her work within three years amount to 47% at national level. 
With the journalists there are 30%. 
The subject of the " sure work " in the team (our "editors", Ed.) is in the USA always a topical subject. 
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. 
In a gigantic nation, as it the USA are, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio stations and TV transmitters and Internet operators, the employers offer like they like and thus it becomes a question from take it or leave it. 
The editors in chief very often get very much high wages, the editor against it can get now and again only 10,000 euros per month, in addition pension money and insurance money. 
What concerns the vacation, the thing is complicated: a certain amount during days in the first year, thus and so many after the third to reach 15 holidays, in the end, after a certain number of years. 
But the American journalists become as they themselves admit, in the course of the year often "ill". 
It is a question of the climate. 
UNIPOL: COURT IN THE ROM: DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS in GROTTAFERRATA 
The president of the second penal chamber of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the estate agent. This had asked to be moved by Grottaferrata to Rome. 
It is determined against Coppola because of Bank-red within the scope of the investigation about the counterarrangement in the case of the takeover by Unipol-Bnl. 
In the course of the process against him during the letzen week, his dismissal from the house arrest was converted into a stay duty in Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to permit to the estate agent, to be moved by the provincial town in an apartment in the capital. 
According to the court transfers (against which could to him such themselves the public prosecutor's office had finished speaking) the possibility to influence his society and to reach to him accusing evidence. 
The �lite is in danger 
The phenomenon had itself already some days ago reveals when the representative's chamber was right against the 700-billions dollar-savings parcel of the White House: Of a big part the American was and is interested more to punish the embankment Street than to save the economy. 
This confirms the yesterday's issue New York Times which reports about how the crisis divides the republican party in the run which to itself more and more splits in her old and moderate East Coast soul which always favored the state institutions and business community and that neoconservative one which faces " to those in Washington " and the financial world hostilely and wins v. a. in the south and the center of the states voter. 
This part of the party owes his rise v. a. of the voice of that which I mentioned on top. 
This just mentioned example is meanwhile only a small part of the big changes which the momentary economic earthquake announces or even already explains: not only in the USA, also in the whole west and maybe also after this will be concerned by these. 
In the states as well as in Europe the crisis seems to accelerate the long expected events which accept, finally, figure under these new conditions and come to light. 
First of these phenomena the new discovery, the incredible Renaissance of the state is in connection with a kind of Renationalisierung of the economy. 
Indeed, the crisis signifies a decline of the bank ions and financial institution ions which narrow connections with the foreign country own and administer at the same time an immense amount of the property from private house holds which live in one single state. 
This signifies an immediate political problem for the governments: namely as it is a matter to behave in accordance with the affected families which show also a huge electoral mass. 
The crisis seems global economically, political against it she is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems to have got thus to itself in the offside and his speech right to have lost: The clear proof for this has been given by the EU which knows how to find no common way on account of her division in two parts in different national and international conflicts. 
Now, hence, everything count on the intervention of own state; rescue plans, new rules, and v. a. Distribution of auxiliary fund: Since the crisis became more and more serious, merely the USA are to be escaped in the economic position without foreign help. 
And, in addition, beside the means they also own the legitimization this to use: therefore two not too �berwertende conditions? under certain circumstances? on which usually probably no international organization and no market will be able to fall back in similar way. 
That new stress which is laid on the state-national element is, for the rest, in perfect harmony with the bigger and bigger meaning which is associated recently in the economy with one on the narrowest related sector: the Territorialit�t. 
Just now of paradoxical way it is when we however, thus is convincing were to have entered for a long time into a linked up whole empire, in an empire of the always differentiated technologies, the immaterial that we must find out all at once how our future depends, nevertheless, more and more on the essentially material things: Water, harvest and oil. 
Indeed, these can be transported indeed everything by a place in the other of the world, are connected, however, still on extreme with a narrowly umschriebenen piece of earth? to a territory. 
Hence, that is which disposes of such a territory, another towards which lives free area, in the advantage in without crop, without water or from oil occurence. 
Now I come to the second novelty which assumes, nevertheless, a short Einschub. 
Who says territory, who government who says policy with it also Leader-hip. 
In this sense the financial crisis seems to generate two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand is there the knowledge about the necessity respectable Leaderships, thus the need for somebody who knows how one regulates the things. 
Now on the other side exists a wave of the indignation about the existing guidances, v. a. that of the economy which have turned out insufficient and full shadow zones. 
There there comes, in the end, a deep passing and in certain sense even more disconcerting aspect: A trust loss, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of the distance which is all directed on a whole class of managers of the western lands. 
It seems to make a way thus the conviction under big parts of the population the way that these are not only the actions of the social �lite, but already her world of ideas, her Way of Life, her culture in the farthest sense of the word, whose salary explains to the majority as more and more foreign and overcome. 
The inquiry after Leader-hip feeds underground a branched however mighty movement of the loss of power of the leading class and the customary political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the abrupt change of the collective state of mind of the last time: here beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the breakdown of the Labour party in Great Britain, there to the rebellion of the American representatives against Bush (and maybe the victory of the rights in Italy also plays a role). 
One wins the impression as if the old �lite has, her parties, her programs, but also her rites, magazines, to intellectual believers, some one would say her format, more and more understanding problems and, hence, less representative value with regard to that what proceeds nowadays in the lower social layers of the west and is still strengthened by the financial crisis and is done up to �berdimensionalit�t. 
In view of all his one it would be simply exaggerated to speak of a " rebellion of the masses ". 
However, the eyes is not to be kept open far meanwhile certainly. 
The superglue which allows to rise by walls 
To defeat the forces of the gravitation thanks to a paste and to can do walls hochklettern like superman. 
This is the object of four American research centers from which now apparently almost in the purpose has arrived. 
With one on a surface of only 2.5 sq. cms of angry glue the researchers have succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall. 
The STUDIO? an American magazine has, has published the results of the researchers of the university of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia institutes of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material fictitious by the research team is an advancement of the already used pastes which use a special carbon structure, called Kohlenstoff-Nanor�hrchen. 
" The principle of the glue one can fancy like a row to a pile of spaghetti of arranged tubes ", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia institutes of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists could be inspired by the feet of the geckos which are covered of microscopic tiny hairs which give a perfect hold to the animal. 
With different materials like glass Teflon and sandpaper to carried out tests have shown that the new glue is 10 times stronger than the hold ability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time allows to remove " easily from the wall ", according to Liming Dai, researcher of the faculty for engineer's sciences of the university of Dayton. 
By WALLS ENTLANGWANDERN? " This material could be used as a transient paste ", Liming Dai subjoins. 
Possibly around like Spiderman on walls emporzugehen? Maybe already, however, the researchers think rather of a less fascinating use, as for example the connection of electric devices, because the Nanor�hrchen are also a leader of warmth and electricity. 
Other areas of application could fall in the area of the astronautics. 
For the time being the superheroes must still wait. 
THE OTHER KIND OF THE RESEARCH? also the university of Berkeley, California, devotes itself to a new glue kind. 
In an article of the American Chemical Society the California scientists present a paste from microfibers itself the like hair by movement on a surface even from the dust clean and thereby always a perfect liability preserve. 
Medicament: with fruit juice never take 
Care before grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice. 
These drinks which are consumed on account of her refreshing quality and her vitamin wealth v. a. in summer can cause serious health defects if they are taken at the same time with certain vital drugs, because they can affect the admission this by the body in extreme way. 
David Bailey, professor of the University of western Ontario in London, points repeatedly to the risk of packed as well as fresh fruit juices in connection with drug taking. Within the scope of the 236-th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia he hit alarm once more: There is enough a glass of apple juice, orange juice or grapefruit juice to reduce so far the receptiveness of certain vital drugs that these are eliminated practically and thus the health of the patients is endangered. 
Grapefruit juice was already under suspicion to be responsibly, to increase the effects of some drugs like antibiotics, Antiasthmatika, heart circulation drugs, anxiolytischer and neuro-logical means, up to toxic levels. 
DRUGS IN DANGER? The same agency of the medicament had warned in a report about two years doctors and patients before the dangers of this Mixes, and had stressed to pay attention to what is drunk in connection with means as for example Diazepan or Metadon. 
IT IS NOT ONLY A GRAPEFRUIT? According to the experts the substances which can restrain the medicaments also contain orange juice and apple juice. 
The list of the active substances inhibited by the fruit juices is long. 
Hence, the appeal of Michele Carruba, the manager of the Universit� Statale di Milano: " Such results are normally passed on immediately to the different international manufacturers to whom it stays empty in such a way to change the consumer's formations. 
Hence, it is advisable to read always the packing addition and if still lacks of clarity insist on having no shyness on asking a druggist or doctor ", stresses the expert of the Ansa agency. 
Economic Nobel prize goes to Paul Krugman 
The economic Nobel prize is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of commercial patterns and the settlement of economic activities. 
The 55 years old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer which teaches at the university of Princeton and famously for his regular articles for New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the economic policy and foreign affairs of the Bush's administration. 
Few months after the posters from the 11th September, 2001, during the days of the Enron breakdown, Krugman had stated in an editorial New York Times, this second event has been more vital for the history of the USA than the attempts. 
A prediction which received a lot of polemic as an answer and was reproached with the small farmer still years later today, however, absolutely right turns out. 
" I am surprised and also shocks at how fast the recollection of the scandals have disappeared within the scope of the breakdowns of Enron or Worldcom from the public field of vision ", explained Krugman in the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the executive committee of the European central bank Krugman is a " small farmer of big value ", however, also a Banalisierer with a " very aggressive style which is directed especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush's government. " 
Open office, there appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" parcel 
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source software wins as a free substitute with Microsoft office a bigger and bigger number in users, at home as well as in the office, among freelance as well as in the public management. 
Now after one year of the intensive work by the voluntary developers which is supervised by SUN Microsystems the new Open office presents itself with some novelties to the audience: now, finally, beside revised and now more Spartan formed beginning menu, an entirely guaranteed compatibility with Apples operating system Mac OS x is reached, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document format) 1.2 format, thus the newest standard ISO version, is given. 
Eight against will be able to be read further on the compatibility with Microsoft office in 2007, new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) by OpenOffice. 
Some are interesting also new features, possibly that which allows to reduce the size of Powerpoint presentations what eases, e.g., the mailing via email. Moreover the possibility also counts to import PDF files in graphic arts treatment modules and to preserve at the same time the original appearance of the side. 
Now thus can be generated also the "hybrid" PDF files which extend the typical graphic arts of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processing system. 
The collaboration is one of the strongest improved elements of the applications: Now tables can be worked on mehrh�ndig by different users by which conflicts are avoided by changes; in the case of the word processing system it is assigned to every editor a Frabe to guarantee such better correction procedure. 
Some companies are about just to publish different functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while during the coming weeks the definitive result should be publicized. 
The Italian version is available on following left to download: http: // it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html. Therefore she follows the English version which is since Friday on mirrors. 
Except for Windows and Mac OS the program is also available for the operating system Linux. 
On inquiry one can allow to send the installation-CD home or in the office. 
If the cost freedom can be meanwhile a stimulus for the spreading of the program in the private house holds, it also is just in the area of the business where OpenOffice the big throw could succeed: in the end, different equipment of the public management and schools has already gone over to OpenOffice. 
Really there is not even not enough a training offer what signifies an optimum help to small and middle enterprises, and therefore opens even business prospects. 
OpenOffice consists of five main parts: Writer, the Word suitable Texterstellungsprogram; Calc, the Tabellenprogram which aims at a displacement of Excel; Impress, for the production of presentations like with Powerpoint; Dbase to the incentive of data banks at place of the more known Access; and last Draw, a graphic arts module. 
The objective for 2008 is to reach 5 millions downloads? a purpose which can be exceeded with 3 millions achieved by now and 600 000 also easily. 
Also Kohl positively tested and with it the fourth doping case 
There opens a new doping case mi frame of the past tour de France: it concerns Austrian sportsman Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, as a third-classed and winner of the tricot of the best climber. 
The news published the newspaper L'Equipe on her web page. 
The 26-year-old cabbage of the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver who was tested positively for Cera, the Epo of the third generation. Before this already applied with the Italians Riccardo Ricc� and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher. 
The analyses from the blood tests of Kohl belong to those which were effected during the last weeks by the labs Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If the counter proofs confirm now the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded for two years from the runnings. 
The boss of the French anti-doping committee Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest, and informs according to Associated Press also the Austrian responsible. 
The 26-year-old Austrian rose behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the platform and claimed further also the tricot of the best climber for himself. 
SUBJECT IMMIGRATION: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS: IS ITALY RACIST? 
Italy, " the former land of the emigrants has become recently one of the preferential lands for immigrants " who are taken up only with opposing. 
Do this from the Belpaese a nation of racists? This asks New York Times in a long article which is completely dedicated to the subject of the racism in Italy and goes out from the case of the young, from Burkina Faso stocky Abdul William Guibre who was murdered one month ago in Milan after he a packing of biscuits had stolen. 
The case testifies from him what calls the Times " paradox of the north ": the northern regions are that in which " mostly integration and working possibilities " exist, and still " the highest degree in anti-immigrationistischen Sentiments and the biggest support of the Lega the north is to be registered ". 
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants the Times appeals to other episodes of the intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
And not only ead. 
Also the new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and to the quicker expulsion of the unlawful immigrants is stated as a token of the climate change in Italy. 
A movement which also underline the pope and the president: " Giorgio Napolitano asked the pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for a collaboration between church and state to the fight of the racism. " 
Students victim up to 900 euros per room high Mietspreise 
The market for apartments for students knows no crises. 
According to the last investigation of the Sunia, the tenant's trade union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome. 
" This phenomenon has already accepted very serious trains. Whole crowds of students lose so actually her right to study, because her families are not able to support them by this height "? so the person responsible of the Sunia, Laura Mariani? " in these towns the big inquiry leads on the part of the students to a deformation of the market which has also damaged the other inhabitants. 
Besides, most rent offers contain a row of offense: free contracts, missing registrations, without rent price border, unauthorised unterrents. 
For the Sunia the necessity exists after the unusual measures which lead by a reworking of the taxation for lower rent prices. 
In case of more precise consideration of the investigation turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the quarter Brianza approx. 450 euros are needed; a single room begins with 650 euros (in the quarter volumes Nere) and Vittoria ends with 800 euros in the quarter Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the quarter. 
In Florence a sleeping place costs on an average 350/400 euros, a room 700. 
In Bologna where the students concentrate in the quarters around the university 2,50/,280 euros are for a sleeping place of miseries, 370 to 500 for a single room. 
In Rome the prices lie in the quarters around the university with about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room. 
Only a little more deeply the rents are in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecitt�. 
Only who makes way in outlying districts money can save: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar accommodations. 
In Naples need one 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price lies between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350. 
In the smallest towns the prices are lower, however, they have a bigger weight in the urban economy. 
In the towns in which the phenomenon of the renting is more frequent to non-European students as for example in Perugia, exists even an other anomaly: rents which lie about 25-30% above average are demanded of foreign students. 
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso? the towns close her historical film halls 
The historical cinemas close on account of the preferred multiplex cinemas. 
" A town without film halls is a blind town, how a face without eyes. " 
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes what at the moment in the big urbane centers of Italy with effect, and also happens in the provinces. 
The process of the exclusion of the cinemas which began with the birth of the big multi hall complexes in the periphery signifies in the long term the death for the Einsaalkino in the center. A process which seems inevitable not only and irrevocable but also the trains of a cultural crime carries. 
Mostly historical places of full recollections are concerned, " it is like a friend to lose with whom one has put back a piece of street of full emotions ", according to the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso who introduced the Oskar and the big price of Cannes in him 20 years ago. It concerns the history of a suburban cinema and his nostalgia which insists on living in a probably film world lost for good. 
The figures which speak the Anec which delivers central trade federation, a clearly language: during the last five years had to close the immense amount from 316 traditional cinemas; the cinemas paid for the most part this bill in the big towns: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
The Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed from Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41 belong to the strongest affected regions. 
This testifies of the fact that the major offenders are the multiplex cinemas, because these are just these three regions in which the biggest number of these modern cinemas was registered: with 195 during the last 5 years Lombardy states the lists, 81 are it in Tuscany as well as in the Emilia-Romagna. 
" The business has developed in an irrational way ", indeed, thus Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, " it helps that also new structures arise, however, firstly, there stands the preservation of the quite existing, then a hall closes in the town, all his regular customers are ready not to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one. 
And here the missing budget still remains for the ground of the trade federation �u�er Eight: the debts registered by the state amount to approx. 10 million euros. 
It is a disgrace of the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not follow the existing laws. 
To receive the sector, would be between 16 and 18 million euros in the year of miseries ". 
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian town which has decided on account of the fears around the old film halls to protect this by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it concerns the first agreement of this kind in Italy which is designed to protect the traditional cinemas and to support, and this in the historical center, as well as in the periphery. 
Under the foreseen measures tax Bevorteilungen are also for the film operators as well as advantages for the audience with regard to the close traffic: it will be allowed to go in the traffic-limited areas of the center and to park, in addition, to more favorable park fees. 
" It is a gratifying initiative ", according to Giuseppe Tornatore, " I hope that other towns to our example will join and sketch, in addition, still new drafts. 
Indeed, however, we also need a better audioequipment and videoequipment to be able to straighten something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because today, in the end, the audience from is more demanding. 
The defense of the traditional cinema has been for me always an important subject: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point which brought me, to found "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even if I had already played for 10 years with the thought. 
For 25 years I live in Rome; if I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside not to have to see the dust-overcast posters. 
The connections between policy and ' Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
" The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli. 
The accusations of the bar of the anti-mafia-authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of municipality Gioia Tauro which were arrested this morning because of involvement in mafia shops are serious. 
In handcuffs was also taken Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public management, as well as his nephew: the lawyer who carries the same name like the boss of the clan had been already condemned because of involvement in criminal unions of the mafia, at that time to an amount of damages of 10 million euros. 
" Every kind of moral and juridical norm ignoring ", so write the lawyers, " had decided both local management, which to pay lawyer Piromalli money for consultation operations. " 
" Therefore it had been made the mafia group possible? so the judges? to penetrate on official way into the city halls and to have an influence on the policy of the public management. " 
The president of the regional committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not say no that it is in his region " anything but an exception to bump into connections of local management and the organized crime. " " There are places in which the concentration of the mafia is bigger than in others in which such connections are inevitable practically. 
But there is also local politician who resist the pressure of the ' Ndrangheta: The heroes who keep a white vest. " 
The arrests from this morning follow those from the last July with which according to the police the clan Piromalli was beheaded. 
Since end of the last April the district council had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro, however, already in 1991? and also at that time on account of supposed connections between organized crime and the local management? if the local politicians of her local authorities had been relieved. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, at that time mayor of the Udc, has been chosen after the ballot from May, 2006 the head of the center right coalition. 
He shouted the resolution to scandal as the prefecture of the district council arranged. 
He prosecuted on it in vice Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti to whom he accused to have invented everything for political-strategical reasons. However, the judges explain in connection with the arrest warrant from this morning that the Piromalli clan had even dared to apply for a change of the A3 project. 
From a listening action in connection with the investigations to the case Dal Torrione, the readiness has appeared to meet the wishes of an enterpriser who is as is known a representative of the big group around the Piromalli by which the measures of the public management became identically with the interests of this clan.

If the energy arises from the waves, the tallness suddenly accumulates 
It is a not drying up monetary spring which covers more than 70% of the surface of the planet and only now the big energy companies of the world seem to understand this. 
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources on now everything look, and also try to occupy, possibly giants like chevron. 
The possibility to win energy from the movements of the sea is already considered for 70 years and is examined; not by chance these studies intensified since the first oil crisis substantially. 
As the price of the oil about 1980 broke gasify one the idea of the sea energy, now, however, the environmental organizations and the risen oil price press for new impulses in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the worldwide power demand could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves. 
This would amount to the double of the energy at the moment produced by nuclear power stations. 
In addition, there still the currents and tides would come. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first company which places now on the sea energy is Enersis which has signed in 2005 a contract to the establishment of a power station in the north of Portugal. 
When this news was published it seemed to concern a revolutionary step. 
Now two years later these are more and more companies from the traditional energy branch which place on the marine power production. 
" Chevron examines these technologies "? so the speaker of an enterprise known to the US-American giant in the Wall Street Journal? and if the possibility weighs to cooperate from with us. " 
It is, on this occasion, about the procurement of a licensing of the American energy committee which is necessary to begin a project before the coast of Alaska. 
This is a sign not to be underestimated, v. a. if one thinks that just in Alaska furthermore oil is promoted through the USA and president Bush recently got going only the plans for new drillings. 
Beside chevron are also the proficient Verdant Power Inc from New York and Ocean power from New Jersey which invest in the new branch; if the details are also not known, nevertheless, observers speak of a rising interest. 
Still improvement-worthy technologies. 
Experts speak not least of a technology still being in the departure, this, because yet the last doubts are not cleared by sides of the environmentalists. 
Up to now projects are like that in Portugal and also Scotland of rather small dimension and seem to cause no ecological problems to be taken seriously. 
To produce, nevertheless, energy on a large scale, it requires technologies with far bigger influence on the environment. 
There are different possibilities: Ocean power possibly uses a system of buoys linked with each other. 
The push of the waves which move the buoys on and down is converted within the swimmers about piston and cylinder into hydraulic pressure. 
This drives a turbine which pursues a generator again. 
The stream is sent on it about unterwater pipes to the coast. 
Till present there are four planned arrangements of the this kind which wait only for the state approval. A part of the won energy could also serve for military equipment. 
Verdant power produces meanwhile already energy for a goods department store and a park bib with the help of unterseeischer turbines in the East River of New York. 
The water movements during the tides drives the turbines which feed the generator by the originating rotary movement. 
According to Verdant a long queue of possible clients already waits for the necessary Autorisierungen around these energy sources to be of use. 
Only the waves, then the tides. 
A special interest earns according to the institute of stream production research presently the potential which is in the tides. 
Although it also concerns an irregular phenomenon, nevertheless, the tides are better predictable as wind currents, of the solar irradiation and also the waves, and, hence, a trustworthier stream spring. 
It is just the tidal energy which federal states made like New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states invest already 7.5 million dollars in 2008? for 2009 are already planned up to 35 millions.
