The case highlights the NSA total absence of debate on intelligence
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on one side is offended in public by calling the ambassador of the United States on October 21, and the other overflight prohibited by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence of Edward Snowden board?
In my view, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When Fran√ßois Hollande phone or when Barack Obama Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summoned the ambassador of the United States, they react to a real discovery, which is that the magnitude of the American surveillance of all communications France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and other tracks condemnation of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Is there would be no hypocrisy like a wave of your hand?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but research interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks unveils analysis of American diplomacy, political or other issues in the world, in fact we consider that, in view of American power, this is an important insight.
When we describe the U.S. interception systems against the French diplomacy in the United States is in no way to be outraged by this practice is to describe the world as it is.
France has she received information from the NSA for terrorist operations to our interests?
Can we deprive the U.S. collaboration?
Implementation since wholesale ten years of technological tools powerful interception by the United States, but also France, was officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and are described both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French by the means of the NSA.
France can be conducted, for example, to transmit entire data blocks on the Sahel region to the U.S., and in return - we have already said quickly - the Americans can provide information on the French of other regions of the world.
So the fundamental question behind this case is not as NSA capacity or the right of countries to develop tools interception, that the issue of the total lack of prior debate, including in parliaments on justification of such systems, the scope must be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of violations of civil liberties.
Real risk that the United States? degradation of their image?
However much denounce, I do not see how they can be punished.
The risk to Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and that was the case recently - learn their officers, sometimes at the highest peak of their state, were monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries with diplomatic relations with the United States are strained.
Another effect may be more economical it: more and more European and South American companies are reluctant, in the light of revelations, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. providers are subject to U.S. law, and therefore the influence of NSA.
Last element: the vast movement of revelations committed by the world's media, which helps to initiate a debate on monitoring practices of intelligence hitherto non-existent, could push lawmakers, including Americans, to reconsider the credentials they have given their intelligence services.
Barack Obama receives the Iraqi prime minister, in full outbreak of violence
The U.S. president was to receive Friday 1 November 2013 Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking help from the United States to fight against the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq has experienced in October its deadliest in five and a half months, according to figures released Friday, November 1 by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN provides an even higher balance with 979 dead and 1,902 wounded.
This violence is more deadly despite security measures and military operations launched major for months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
Two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence raised fears of a new conflagration while neighboring Syria is in the throes of a civil war.
The bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are killed in the street or even at home, and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complained of being marginalized politically and be the target of unjust arrests, favored the outbreak of violence.
Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the deaths of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), an affiliate of Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists) group, also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "global war" against Al Qaeda.
Violence is the focus of discussions in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their last meeting, Dec. 12, 2011.
At the time, the U.S. president, elected on a promise to end military involvement in that country, had set an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has numerous meetings with the executive, and members of Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community takes a "third world war" against Al Qaeda.
The principle of increased aid to Iraq security is supported by influential senators Republicans and Democrats.
But they have also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by its "sectarian and authoritarian politics."
They also demanded Obama make it clear to Maliki that "the pernicious influence of Iran in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
French police stop Anderlecht supporters from other coaches with RSCA
The French police decided to lay down strict rules for the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain set Tuesday contacted Marie Verbeke, the spokesman of the police zone Brussels-noon Friday.
Belgian RSCA fans who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League must only use the travel system set up by Anderlecht.
"The convoy of buses will be escorted by the police from a former border crossing point Rekem to PSG," forwarded the spokesman.
The course will be the same for the return.
"If other fans had an intention to go to Paris by other means, the prefecture of French police said that steps have been taken to make arrests or police custody," has yet announced Marie Verbeke.
The probe Vatican on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a large survey worldwide on how parishes manage sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and couples same sex.
The survey asked participants how priests deal with gays couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October each national bishops' conference, with the instruction to get the best possible answers.
The information will be used to a large gathering of family that Pope Francis is planning next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the "National Catholic Reporter", an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesman for the Catholic Bishops Conference of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop decides how to properly search the parishioners.
In the UK, bishops have published the Internet survey asking Catholics to participate.
The 37 year old man who took a child hostage to Gabrielle Roy School Surrey faces six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Mustafa Hassan was accused of hostage taking, kidnapping, uttering threats, possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose, removal, and failure to comply with an order.
"The rapid response of the officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Paquet in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will appear in court Friday.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure one takes to smoke a cigarette.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice life of nicotine dependence.
Further tests are needed before starting the tests on humans, but Professor Ronald Crystal at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an innocuous virus that was modified to carry the genetic information necessary for designing anti-nicotine antibody.
The selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all nicotine molecules present in the bloodstream and neutralize before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker to have their dose of nicotine.
In tests, mice vaccinated who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mice who had not been vaccinated were "appeased", said the researchers, indicating that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous vaccines against tobacco were ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections should be repeated as frequently as the antibody levels remain high they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, that would prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit.
"They know that if they start smoking, they did take no pleasure because of anti-nicotine vaccine, and it will help them lose their bad habit," he has said.
British scientists said the results were interesting but noted that much more research was needed.
Egyptian Islamists in the streets to denounce the trial Morsi
There is anger in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of ousted President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
Mobilization across Egypt to demand the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial underlines this militant Muslim Brotherhood.
So far no lawyers have been able to meet and no volunteers could take a copy of the documents of the case.
This is not a trial, this is a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a fake trial protested a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to judge Sisi, not the opposite.
Morsi must judge Sisi the massacres of Rabaa, massacres Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes erupted in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
Monday, 20 000 police officers will be deployed outside the police academy in Cairo, which will be judged Mohamed Morsi.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced Thursday, October 31 that rabies was detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, obviously foreign origin while France is free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 at Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation was initiated to identify and support people who have been in contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October inclusive," said the ministries of health and agriculture.
"Five people have been in contact with the kitten had already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies administered after contact with the animal carrier, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
Departments are now calling people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched or licked on mucous membranes or injured by a kitten or animal whose skin was in contact with the kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between the 10 hours and 18 hours from November 1.
"France is rabies since 2001, kitten or mother were imported from another country, not free," the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture says that the latter "indigenous" Rage identified was in December 1998 and a fox that "France is officially declared free of the disease in November 2001 by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE)" .
A case of rabies in a dog illegally imported from Gambia was recorded in 2008.
"Rabies is a fatal disease if not treated in time," recalls departments and it is transmitted for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease.

An Australian appealed his sentence in Thailand
A resident of Sydney, 21, sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for falsely claimed to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, has appealed the ruling and has been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Court of Phuket on June 15 false statements after telling Thai police a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who mastered, had assaulted early Sunday, June 10
However, video recordings were later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she admits to having invented the story from scratch.
She was detained in a cell at the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 15 days in a detention center low security on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a prison for women.
This is the daughter of former Australian player Rugby League Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to help her daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph of Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the welfare of her daughter and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We've obviously experienced a scary moment, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed the verdict and was released upon payment of a deposit of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that until she was on vacation in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKrabi in southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to a heavier sentence of up to two years imprisonment and incarceration in an adult prison .
However, after the recent murder in Phuket Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to improve its deteriorated with tourists image, which could lead to an acquittal.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are prosecuted for Nortel patents
The group has thousands of older patents Nortel started an avalanche of lawsuits patent Thursday against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google, the company he topped the post when selling to Patent auction which took place after the bankruptcy of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the Assize Court of the United States States Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, and Sony Ericsson.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that display advertising related search terms on the Internet, said the conclusions of the trial, which is the heart of business of Google.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run the Android operating system from Google, which delivers a stiff competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made ‚Äã‚Äãan initial offer of $ 900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, and finally propose $ 4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patents Rockstar face, Google acquired Motorola Mobility Suite for $ 12.5 bn, a market based in part on the library Motorola patents.
"Although he failed in his attempt to acquire the patents at issue in the auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe said patents," said the conclusions of the trial.
Rockstar calls for greater against Google damages because it claims that the infringement of patents Google is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the anti-corruption state regulator.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied having changed the policy of commercial leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had vested interests in three properties in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obeid had lobbied several Ministers of State to renew its leases in Circular Quay, where Obeid has two restaurants and a caf√©, after they expire in August 2005, but there has been a call for tenders.
Is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi knew the secret of Mr Obeid interest in these properties, following the testimony of former Deputy Secretary General Mr Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole Thursday.
Over the years of discussions initiated in 2005, the government pushed for the leases are subject to a tender.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, leases regarding companies from Circular Quay, which pertained to Obeid approximately $ 2.5 million per year have been renewed without there being any tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports February 2006 to November 2009, was favorable to start bidding.
But he denied having changed its policy at the request of Mr Obeid, who found Mr Tripodi, demanded a change in government policy leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations made ‚Äã‚Äãto the ICAC showed passed in August and September 2007 calls between Mr Obeid, Tripodi and Mr Steve Dunn, an officer who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under the orders of M Obeid Department of Fisheries.
"The topic discussed during the telephone conversations was it the policy development on commercial leases? "Asked the Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Mr Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr Tripodi.
I do not remember what we talked about but in any case, it was not that.
In any case certainly not between me and Mr Obeid.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but not make a call on their mobile phone)
The airline passengers to use their electronic devices from door to door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talking on their cell phone - under the new long-awaited guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to another, said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that the planes meet the new guidelines and they have updated training manuals crew and rules concerning the storage devices for compliance.
The FAA said it had already received some airlines plans to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted their plans.
"Depending on the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," said the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to turn on before the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain gave the green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their devices during the descent of the aircraft before landing and do not turn on until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, the airlines whose aircraft are adequately shielded from electronic interference may allow passengers to use their devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with these changes.
"Once the new policy implemented safely - and we will work closely with carriers for it - it will benefit everyone," said Glading in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling as "overseers room" when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be prohibited from connecting to the Internet for surfing, exchange emails, SMS or data download below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers must bring their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble online game playing style that actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled noisily an American Airlines flight after refusing to turn off his device while the aircraft was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops should always be stored because they might hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belonging to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker National Transportation Safety Board, National Transportation Safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered at risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly interfere with navigational instruments, but because we know from the FCC, they could disrupt the antennas of mobile telephony if they are used on board, "said Rosenker.
An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government allows a wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., Argue that there is no valid reason for these security restrictions.
Restrictions are also more difficult to apply because the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of the passengers forget to turn off their devices, or are deliberately.
The FAA has begun to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interference with navigation instruments and communication when passengers transported FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
New airliners are significantly more electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for several years.
Modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems had also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners should allow wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Electronic devices today generally emit radio transmissions much lower power than previous generations of devices.
The e-book readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, company officials have charged a commercial airliner of Kindle e-book readers and did fly to see if there were problems, but there were none.
This inspired the members of the Advisory Committee on FAA mixed feelings on the issue of whether the use of devices present a risk or not.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed that interference from appliances were real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots indicate that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allows pilots to ask passengers to turn off their devices during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group of travel industry welcomed the changes, calling arrangements full of sense for travelers equipped with technologies.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety," said Roger Dow, president and director of the U.S. Travel Association.
The rules relating to the use of electronic devices on board are yet in force in Australia
Australian airline passengers will continue to turn their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite the action of the United States to relax the rules on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers to change their procedures to ensure that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight, provided that they are in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can already do for most of the flight, but many people find it hard not being able to access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers examine the decision requiring U.S. carriers to carry out important work to meet the requirements, but said they did not intend at present to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but noted that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight were still in force in Australia.
"CASA has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," she has said.
The issue is the subject of a regulation that requires aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of security and permanence passengers to meet the safety instructions given by the crew.
Virgin, who has already spoken to CASA's intention to expand the use of its in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said it would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a review of CASA which allows the use of electronic devices because we really believe that it would improve the client now that we have (the in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft experience" , said a spokesman.
Qantas said it respected the moment the current rules.
"Consistent with our current policy, electronic devices can not be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend immediate change that," she said.
The decision of the FAA applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will examine closely the decision of the FAA and the reasons thereof.
For U.S. airlines, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as reviewing the manuals, training materials, the transportation program of hand luggage and instructions provided to passengers.
"When an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable electronic devices light as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," said FAA .
In the rare case of low visibility, the crew asked passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that the heaviest devices are safely stowed under the seat or in the overhead bins during takeoff and landing.
The CDC publishes advice on allergies in children for schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Control and Prevention of Diseases has published a set of guidelines on how to manage food allergies in school children.
This is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. government publishes, since the number of school-age children with food allergies has increased sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children has increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to educate faculty and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them in case of allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine - the autoinjector EpiPen brand being the most commonly used - to react quickly in case of life-threatening anaphylaxis.
The state legislatures have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to more easily epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel that something bites my tongue," "I feel I have a lisp" or "I have tingling on the tongue."
Many opposition to physician-assisted dying in Congress palliative care
The Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Conference, taking place this week in Ottawa, comes days after the vote in favor of the principle of the bill on medical assistance to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for many palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would end their days, according to a spokesman for the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association Maryse Bouvette.
If we focused on palliative care in Canada's approach to euthanasia becomes minimal.
The Chair of Palliative Care Network of Quebec also rejected the bill on medical assistance to die.
If passed, Alberte D√©ry worries affect future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she says.
The majority of hospices refuse to help patients die, according to vice-president of the Alliance of hospices, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-house Savoie in Gatineau, said the service would be useless anyway.
Never asked us: "I want to die, give me an injection."
The director of the Palliative Care Association of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes the bill of Quebec misleads people about the purpose of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For its part, the Liberal member for Gatineau, St√©phanie Vall√©e says that the concept of end of life needs to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Halloween 2013¬†: En chiffres
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, go to bed late and disguise ourselves to go in the neighborhood.
Today, I became more stingy.
The last two years, I did not distribute a single sweet and I certainly will not this year.
But the stats show that I'm the black sheep when talking about Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
I look forward to every Halloween party, what are the trends.
Costumes should represent $ 1.2 billion on $ 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate objects sexy rage.
Women no longer need to be sexy professional and they can also be sexy food like pizzas, burgers and carrots.
Regarding men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I bet that spacemen Daft Punk will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there is no harm to remain traditional.
We dressed our dogs last year and to my amazement, they were not alone.
In fact, Americans will spend $ 330 million on pet costumes this year, according to NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs.
In the case of candy, it does not glandouille.
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go hunting for candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we buy and we do not tell stories, consuming 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Candy corn is the only thing we do not want to eat, and yet nearly 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents approximately 9 billion grains of corn.
It is a mystery that I am not yet come to be elucidated.
Nothing is more representative than Halloween haunted houses.
They carry the best names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $ 500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes these great pictures of you peeing on you that your friends put on Facebook and you can not remove and which type that you like leave a comment of style "pretty face."
Finally, talking about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown has presented The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carve a pumpkin-shaped lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - this is something we do since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "trend of baby-pumpkin" began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of these carved pumpkins and we did not have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend approximately $ 106 million in pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Pumpkins, lanterns slowly wither on the porch of your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you are looking to get noticed more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to carve their pumpkin 922 kg.
Transport schoolboy: the admissible complaints
The Commission scolaire de la R√©gion-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) requires from the beginning of the school year costs $ 150 per student (up to a maximum of $ 300 per family) for students receiving school transport two homes, a service provided by the organization where it is able to do so.
Before changes in the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the board and I was interested," says Ms. Lef√®vre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to a mediation and requested additional time to think about it.
"It's always better to talk, to get together and find solutions," said Ms. Lef√®vre.
The Commission scolaire de la R√©gion-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) did not comment.
The organization has only meant that mediation is part of the process when a complaint.
DR Congo: Army attack last rebel stronghold
Irreducible M23, a few hundred fighters were holed up near 2000 meters on agricultural hills Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba two localities about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"It has not stopped since this morning, fighting continues despite the night," he told AFP a resident of Jomba, reached by phone around 12:30, and in which a young girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of fighting has dropped a bit," said he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed a little rebel."
According to the witness wishes to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before getting to the front for a "sweep".
Could be heard clearly behind him crackling fed arms.
Bunagana, political stronghold and the last stronghold of the rebellion fell Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear explosions of heavy weapons.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the stabilization of the DRC, fighting came "in a final phase", the FARDC has "circled positions to dislodge residual M23".
Since the takeover, Friday, clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, MONUSCO is not directly involved in the fighting, but it provides crucial support in intelligence, observation and government troops planning.
In the late afternoon, several dozen soldiers well supplied with ammunition, rode towards the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana border post with Uganda, the military helped civilians were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a truck brand new FARDC to take over another machine pounding M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called on Wednesday once again the rebels to "demobilize voluntarily" under penalty of being disarmed "by force", but left open the process of Kampala, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing December so far without result.
On site, the political leaders of M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We ended the talks, there remains only the Ugandan mediation to organize the signing," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-Chairman of the Delegation of the M23, but that information can be confirmed immediately the government side.
The M23 was born of a mutiny in April 2012, former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda to support the M23, that refute Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and the basement is full of coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had sought refuge between Monday and Wednesday by the UN, the movement back to the DRC who had engaged in the morning was reversed in mid-day .
"This morning we recrossed to go in our fields, but the soldiers told us to fall back," he told AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back.
One has the impression that the shots are close to the people.
By early evening, dozens of people across the border, some with a mattress on the head, to spend the night in Uganda.
The Israeli army kills a member of Hamas in Gaza SAP
Israeli tanks firing killed Thursday a Palestinian Islamist militant Hamas and seriously wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip, has been learned-after sources of health services.
Source after the Hamas said that fighting broke out in the region, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were referred by your firing of Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army has merely evoke a "targeted action" in the close of a qualified tunnel "terrorist" by Israel, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced mid-October area.
The concern related to security in Mozambique grows along for conflict between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Founder President of Mozambique, in the process of toiser, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo peaceful chanting slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to return, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Executive Director of an investment company.
Worried about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes against a T-shirt bearing the words "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on Independence Square in the capital Thursday.
For two weeks, there has been almost daily reports of conflict between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed there over 20 years.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by Rhodesia ruled by whites then apartheid South Africa as part of government efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are high for the growing economy since the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the north-west could attract $ 50 billion of investment over the next few years from companies as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and the United States Anadarko.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other voltages.
Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and he launched an attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, October 17.
Assaults on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked the bases of Renamo and tried to kill Dhlakama, leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, spokesman Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes the Renamo responsible for sparking the conflict and accused him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to downplay concerns about instability.
Guebuza said Wednesday AFP, the French news agency that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the strength he had left to try to prove that he could impose decisions in government. "
Frelimo and Renamo insist they both wish to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said Renamo abandoned the peace agreement of 1992.
He told the FT he meant that the agreement was not respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) that does not stop arguing," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and a specialist in Mozambique.
None of them knows negotiate and none of them is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favor of electoral reform, had said it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt to move a patient to obtain concessions and a war chest of the government.
The share of votes collected by Renamo continues to decline since 1992, and a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo should get a greater number of votes in elections.
Mr. Mazanga said Guebuza - who should retire at the end of his second term next year - would destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want fair elections, he does not want peace because he did not want to leave the presidency," said Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what is the capacity of Renamo, but she led flash disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a highway north-south axis major.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira but where is the port where the mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal .
In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was coy when asked if Renamo reiterate that threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has increased frustration aroused by the government, said Fernando Lima, director Mediacoop, an independent media, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that those responsible for the country's future are the government and the president, and it is the latter to find solutions to problems," he said.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
"Nobody cares Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to roads," he added.
Pia: at least four injured in a violent brawl
The small town of Pia has been unusually excessive fever Thursday night.
Three vehicles of police, two ambulances and a crowd of about thirty people, according to testimonies ...
With Halloween, the evening was stirred side Pia where a brawl involving several people broke the side of the post.
At least four minor injuries were reported.
Alerted, the police went there to separate the belligerents and to ensure that the wounded are supported.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who took care of young people in the Halifax area in Nova Scotia, is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested Friday morning after searches of his home and in the office of the National Research Council where he works.
Timberlay Baptist Church, where the pastor officiating, said he was deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, the church leaders indicate that Mr. Hudgins has resigned.
The pastor was released on conditions.
It should include not communicate with anyone under 18 and do not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
Coulson phone hacking was used to check a pipe
The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used the "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a pipe can on a bond involving the Interior Minister then in office, Charles Clarke.
Andrew Edis QC Prosecutor told the court of the Old Bailey News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby his "pretty special advisor."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper responsible Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective to hack voicemail Pawlby and "plant continuously at his door," but Coulson has also called her and left messages voice.
"The prosecution suggested that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW is not the kind of man to sit in front of the house, hoping to surprise people, the kind of man like to present the story to people to see what they say, "said Mr Edis.
He said that NotW used three ways to investigate topics: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is clear that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it can not be otherwise.
But what about the first?
A he knowledge of phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say "Of course if."
Rumors about an affair involving Clarke were taken first by the editorial office of NotW when source, sexually attracted to Miss Pawlby said he was told: "Do not waste your time with it she is with Charles. "
Tape, on which were recorded voicemails hacked his phone at least three times, was seized at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.
The investigators also found on the computer seized from the private detective concerned and his sister Miss Pawlby stored in a "Projects" folder.
During the period when the detective investigating her grandparents Miss Pawlby received anonymous calls when we asked them about it, said Mr Edis.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised monitoring every move Miss Pawlby.
In a voice that left him 18 June 2005 message Coulson said: "I ‚Äã‚Äãhave a story that we plan to publish tomorrow I really want to talk to Charles. "
Mr Edis said that Coulson's involvement in history has followed the same pattern as other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he was attending the same co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted having made ‚Äã‚Äãthe phone hacking.
Bailout of $ 325 million for the health system in Tasmania
The federal government maintains that the bailout of $ 325 million for the faltering health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent steps" to end a crisis caused by the aging of the population of the island nation, the high rates of chronic disease and system constraints .
Funding provided over 4 years, was decided after consultations with the Government Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed a plan for emergency rescue that we will resolve the unique challenges the state is facing," said Ms Plibersek today.
The plan includes a $ 325 million campaign, $ 31 million for elective surgery.
2600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract help catch up.
Funds are also provided for the clinics go to Hobart and Launceston, better patient care, training of medical cadres, dedicated to mental health services and the deployment of electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the idea that, according to the front-line clinicians, it is the best way to cure the health system in Tasmania," said Ms Plibersek.
The minister said that the Tasmanian Government would face a strict regime of preparing reports and accountability.
The State shall maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends additional funds.
A committee composed of three persons will be established to ensure that the state provides services in the most effective and efficient way possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $ 325 million does not count for much "unless they are followed by real reform to strengthen the public health system in Tasmania."
He nevertheless praised the government for responding to the urgent request for help which he presented to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal bailout will greatly remove the public health system in Tasmania from the blacklist," said Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional elective procedures largely reverse the recent cuts.
But the spokesman for the opposition health Peter Dutton think today's announcement is a "quick fix."
"The reason we are here is that the Labour government of the State withdrew its $ 430 million health care system," Has he told ABC TV.
You can not have a state government that tears almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth puts $ 300 million, and argue that this is an auspicious day.
Mr. Dutton visited Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar bailout will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
He walks in the mud, through the jungle and rivers to provide free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends to see hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, only 1 to 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of 10 other heroes for the elect "CNN Hero of the Year".
This person will receive $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Bwelle watched his sick father alternating periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but he has an infection that has spread to his brain, creating a hematoma which he would be the consequences for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle has spent years with his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, he gets any treatment he could receive.
"It is not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 am, rushing to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of the father of Dr. Bwelle in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of health spending in the country are carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," said Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they can not enjoy life.
After seeing his father and all his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed more than 700 surgeries for free during the last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the Yaounde Central Hospital.
And created a humanitarian association nonprofit, ASCOVIME, who goes to rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with thirty people were crammed in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and through difficult terrain to get to the villages who need the help.
Luck does not always follow.
They have repeatedly had to push the vehicle to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: the community organizes a party, singing and dancing and offering them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle - with his big smile and boundless energy - is more than happy to join in the festivities.
The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
"We get 500 people at each visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receiving treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, collected a pair of glasses or a birth certificate free - documents necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply can not afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practice simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
Operations are typically performed in a school, a town hall or a house, after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to make way for the next person.
With lighting generator, the operating room and sterilization equipment, Dr. Bwelle and volunteers working until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It is a grueling pace, but musicians villages generally help the team stay motivated.
"They beat on drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work," said Mr. Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returned to town, tired but proud of the work she has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgeries for free during the last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference to those they are helping.
A man explained that the free operation he underwent to treat a hernia allow it to work again.
"This will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to live this traveling hospital and work as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works the night in private medical practices around Yaounde.
This is the second job, he says, which finances 60% association, the rest is covered by private donations.
"I do not know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with the Dr. Bwelle group.
It is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to conduct these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in its mission, it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they don ' not at home.
"We have been involved in operations to help mop up blood or passing instruments to Dr. Bwelle," said Miss O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Student volunteers usually pay their trip to Cameroon, and often come with medical supplies collected.
But once in Yaound√©, their pensions, transport and education are supported by Dr. Bwelle.
"He is a hero, there is no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gave his life for this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not nearly extinguished.
For Dr Bwelle, workload relatively constant is not a difficulty.
Help others live happily holding the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," said Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons why I do this.

Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior features bucket seats and harnesses 6 point belts, as well as an intercom system.
Among the options include including upgraded brakes, a service providing access to mechanics Bowler Works, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between two events.
Drew Bowler, Director General Motorsport Bowler said: "The rally enthusiasts joining Bowler has changed. "
They are not all experienced, some looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really pleased to offer this approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe it will be a new way to try out different forms of rallies in the UK and internationally, and prepare for the rigors and realities of rally raids.
We had a lot of fun to develop the vehicle Defender Challenge - the championship will be really exciting. "
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Both France Pierre Nora
Puzzled scholars have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in lecture halls and classrooms?
Probably, but emphasizing its low for byways, Sciences Po, the Hautes Etudes.
Referee works of others in his office in the rue Gaston Gallimard-?
Indeed, but ignoring the work hidden and underground writing from the publisher.
Heir chair qu'occupa Fontenelle the French Academy?
While again, but knowing that such coronation can not replace real holy oil, the thesis which it happened.
They readily acknowledged him as a great awakener, host and unifying their work, but noting that it was disinclined to produce itself.
In this uncertain picture of the monument "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
Evil tongues were able to see a giant flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a sharp glance and weighted scholarship, but hopelessly dilettante.
Both books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that one who passed was not to write a lot and well written.
The book should it justice here permanently.
We find, however, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, jubilation last jump as a joint subject to another foot.
But you soon realize that the disparate objects assembled in this book so beautiful as to bring the dealer a single passion: to discover the constituent node of the French identity.
Why the dramatic appeals to national unity?
Identity: it is a time concern.
Here are few, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But the peremptory spirit of our leaders then, the French identity was a timeless essence.
There was deployed in accidents, and the case requires Jacobinism was entrusted to prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
One stalking Pierre Nora is quite different.
It does not arise heir of eternal Frenchness, he refuses to define.
Analyst concerned a familiar strangeness, he wanders into a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by a shaped object puzzles, tormented irritating questions.
Including this one, which comes from the company itself: why, in a country so permanently installed within its borders, whether formerly solidly built and masonry, we hear these dramatic appeals for unity?
They are so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests that to ward off trouble discord born of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And most iconic is obviously one that splits in two national history.
As the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, the monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but could not deny it; rather anxious to find the sacredness and even more eager to unity and indivisibility she beheaded him who was obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, a bit invincible nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To feel the uniqueness of the French identity, nothing beats the four not out of the hexagon, so that the American getaway Pierre Nora could be the heart of his book.
Because America and France and the other one makes a revolution, wrote a bill of rights, wanted to start a new company.
But the American cousins ‚Äã‚Äãonly further emphasize what we own.
There, men who had left their old regime in England and no longer had to worry about.
Here, men crowded a native Old Regime, and even more radical.
There a consensus here revolution when she sowed drama and confit.
There founding fathers always honored here and revolutionary ancestors whose only make models, and that the rest are killed each other.
Here institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, as to catch as many errors and trials to resume.
La France qui s'en va, la France qui vient
Yet there was a time when the French thought they could mend the torn dress in their history, and overcome the curse of number two.
At the Third Republic, Central and creative moment, Pierre Nora has shown great interest and even tenderness welcoming those who are then used to repair the fracture revolutionary, teaching students everything in the old France preparing obscurely modern France and offering a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity had only time.
Here again debate, jostled by the immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of demand-minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book thus offers both a fascinating portrait of France who goes and circumspect sketch of France comes.
With the added bonus of the portrait of the historian should be some surprises.
We discover that the tramp was a homebody.
The man turned multiple sights, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
Prowler margins stood at the center of the center.
And whoever had deposited here more than half a century, a subject on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnation, but was exempted from the initiation of the thesis year, says, cum grano salis, he has finished by doing so.
Though in a less steep shape, more fragmented and more subtle.
But make no mistake, just as binding.
As much as the imposing figure of the university curriculum, this thesis it said inner necessity of life.
How biometrics will invade our lives
No more typing passwords to access their smartphone or pay for purchases?
American researchers, French and Japanese are predicting a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy CEO of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric."
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this craze for biometrics, but are worried.
In 2011 alone and in France, the National Commission on Informatics and Liberties authorized 774 fingerprint recognition systems, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in business, government, canteens ...
"Everyone will soon be identified, anywhere and anytime", is moved Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), Washington.
The reasons for such optimism in some, and pessimism in others?
Biometrics will rely on new techniques that will make new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric is fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous system of the palm or fingers.
But each technique has its limitations.
"For example, some people who work have concrete fingers badly damaged and their fingerprints are unreadable," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection and verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand assume a voluntary gesture and specific people.
This is both a safety - can not capture these data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: sometimes the procedure must be repeated and therefore takes time.
Consequently, research is conducted over the past twenty years on other approaches, such as face recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
With the increase of the accuracy of the sensors and the calculation capacity necessary for the computer data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of face recognition has increased tenfold in the past five years, calculated Cyrille Bataller, Director of R & D labs of Accenture in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or iris movement.
"Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but you need a quiet environment," said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
Unique tamperproof marker DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," says Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of education, innovation and foresight to the CNIL.
But the analysis of DNA is still very long and costly.
NEC offers the services of a police case costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples from the crime scene and in an hour.
Uses of biometrics can be divided into two groups: identification (recognizing a person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who she claims to be).
Identification concerned far the issuance of identity papers: we must confront biometrics (fingerprints, photo, iris) with the information that the state owns all citizens already be on file.
This ensures that a person does not try to impersonate someone else.
This principle can be compared to other applications.
NEC proposes recognition of VIP at the entrance of a hotel or a store.
"We get images of surveillance cameras and compare them to pictures of celebrities circulating freely on the Internet," says Dany Nassif, loaded, NEC France, business development for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: shoot a chap in the queue in a store, track its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially involved physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens ...) or logical (opening a computer).
There is added, more recently, the presence control.
"A biometric time clock avoids the phenomenon buddy that points to another" justifies Cyrille Bataller, Accenture.
But increasingly, authentication will also involve transactions, especially those made ‚Äã‚Äãfrom Internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors introducing the card and putting his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces typing PIN.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve d'Ascq and Angoul√™me by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers in the supermarket: when paying in store with his credit card, the customer does not hit its code but his finger into a reader that scans veins.
The experiment is expected to last six months.
If it is successful, biometric readers could soon arrive in French traders.
Ways to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, through biometrics, a client remains in cash under thirty seconds is significant," says the director of a large area.
The second is to provide personalized services in a few years, a voice server will recognize your voice and offer custom options.
And finally reassure highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The fingerprints are stored on a first server, the identities of people in a second basis: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing, which crashes if you try to move," Philippe lists Robin, Thales.
However, without further study, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Specialists protection of privacy, they continue to worry.
"Advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: a generalized surveillance" predicts Andrew Patrick, the Commissioner for the Protection of privacy in Canada.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $ 100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for hand luggage and $ 2 for a coffee or a soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take with them the unopened cans to off the plane.
The new fees apply to baggage bags stowed in the overhead compartment so small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would pay $ 25 if the fee was paid in advance and $ 100 if travelers are paid once at the gate.
The spokesman for Frontier, Kate O'Malley said that $ 100 was provided to encourage travelers to pay in advance.
"We do not want to pay that price," she said.
The airlines have started charging the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges put as much as they could in hand luggage stowed in overhead bins, and there was often no place in these compartments.
These charges are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said the new fees are not really used to collect money.
This is to explain to customers of Frontier loyal it becomes increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the website of the airline will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a gate Frontier could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue may have to pay $ 100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that the site and the recording Frontier procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these costs before reaching the door.
The cost of hand luggage Frontier will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often grumble about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They estimate that the cost of baggage handling are important and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street consider adding baggage fees as a sign showing that airlines do pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Yet many of them have not touched the baggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first fresh hand luggage there three years, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said consultant Jay Sorensen airlines, which closely follows the extra fee.
He believed in a December 2011 report, the cost of hand luggage Spirit reported $ 50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover fresh unusual hand luggage imposed by the company.
"I've never seen a boarding process as smooth in my entire career," he said.
I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and a fight break out at the door.
The plane was full, he has added, "passengers boarded at the speed of lightning."
Frontier also like Spirit and applies a fee of $ 2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier said that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened cans with them, and those who drink coffee may be leftover free.
She always distribute free water.
U.S. Airways briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
Decision Frontier to pay a fee of hand luggage when passengers do not purchase tickets directly from the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go to its website.
Airlines pay vendors online travel as Orbitz $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold.
It urged all airlines encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of go to a travel agency online.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began to offer only half of frequent flyer miles to customers who bought their ticket through a travel agency online.
Wednesday it has reduced premiums miles of 25% on a journey.
Thus, a journey 000 miles Frontier of1 purchased from a travel agency online would save 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seats in advance only if they buy their ticket on the Frontier site directly.
Frontier has a loyal following in his hometown of Denver, but its activity declines and loses money.
Revenues fell 9% and its flight capacity has decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic attempted to straighten finances Frontier selling the airline.
Scientists have shed light on how the movements of the tail of a dog are related to his mood.
Previous studies have found that happy dogs were moving their tails more to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while the nervous dogs were moving more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "Everyone knows that, in humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimuli that arouse emotions positive or negative. "
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that as humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the movements of tail disordered other dogs, the researchers tracked the animals watching films where other dogs were.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
Surely it will not be long before we understand why their tail will sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented dogs movies where other dogs were - a naturalistic version of a silhouette is to avoid any confounding - and we could tamper with the movement of the tail and the present as going to the left or right. "
When the animals have seen a dog wag his tail expressionless to the right (from the perspective of the dog wagging the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail deviate mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wagging the tail), heart rate accelerated and they seemed anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
Instead, he believes that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry.
He added: "If you repeatedly encounter other dogs and if you notice, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right attitude leads to less friendly, you will react based on this experience. "
Researchers say the findings could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Science at Bristol University professor, said that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln discovered that the dogs turned their head to the left when they watched an aggressive dog and right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, said: "The dogs were more easily to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than the right, instead of becoming anxious - the opposite of what is in the Italian study. "
He indicated that the differences could be that the dogs who participated in the various studies are not fully considered animals movies or robot dogs like dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he has said.
"Although many elements identified in various mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details remain to be clarified - and dogs are no exception," said he said .
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be saved, it will surely not be long before we understand why sometimes move their tail on one side and sometimes on the other.

Live together in French, the challenge of Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of pupils have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated it a year ago, consultation with parents, students, teachers and staff education, to discuss ways to better integrate students who straddle between several cultures.
The school board has unveiled its vision of "Living together in French."
The Vision diversity body walks past year in schools to help students of all backgrounds to discover common benchmarks which are not confined to the French language.
Explore neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Big names of writers, artists, whether they are native or from elsewhere.
Who are the builders?
"So, we create projects so that they identify with all this," says the president of Vision diversity A√Øda Kamar.
Michel Venne, the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges to the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, what the Quebec culture, sense of belonging, support staff in the changes we saw in the student population," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board established a research center that will provide tools for teachers who also sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparing to manage a class in a Quebec North American context.
"Different teaching strategies, that is the real need," she says.
The research will focus on inclusion in all its aspects: linguistic, educational, social and cultural development.
Obama ends the tracks to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to terminate the tracks she practiced on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House attempt to regain control in the case of the NSA listens after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden refuge in Russia.
This is the first time that mentioned IMF surveillance and the World Bank by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Questioned on the subject, an official of the U.S. administration said: "the United States does not conduct electronic surveillance for the seats of the World Bank and IMF in Washington."
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such monitoring was put in place in the past.
Another official, he said that Barack Obama had ordered to stop such practices in the past weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as ending the tracks of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday approved tighter controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their prosecution.
The Committee has introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are authorized to collect and imposed a five-year limit for the storage of such information.
European shares down at the mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, major European stock markets move lower Friday at mid-session, weighed down by some disappointing news from companies, while Wall Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious as they believe that the Federal Reserve could unwind its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.

For its part, Vodafone (2.45%) continues to lead the EuroFirst300 increases in response to a news report wanting AT & T is considering a potential takeover.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the monetary policy of the ECB are going well, as evidenced by John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The single mandate of the ECB has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the meeting next week.
We anticipate a potential drop of the euro.
In this context, the euro continued its decline against the dollar and touched a session low of two weeks at 1.3517 dollar.
These same conjectures support unlike the bond market in the euro area.
This judgment means that a piece of legislation passed in July in the state and handing largely because the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.

The Congolese army pursues rebels M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units were chasing rebels M23 into their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
M23 appears about to be beaten after being chased localities north-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which he controlled from the beginning, there was 20 months of the uprising.
"We will continue the M23 and drive him wherever he is hiding because they are criminals," he told Reuters Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for FARDC.
We must not let them rearrange because they torment the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political leader of the rebellion, told RFI that these military setbacks not alter in any way its claims in the peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and M23.
Clashes are reported in the hills overlooking Bunagana last place in the hands of insurgents have fallen this week, as well as around Runyoni a hill where the rebellion of M23 was born in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, capital of the province of North Kivu, enjoying the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the MONUSCO peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma has led the UN Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of staff, strengthening its mandate and form a rapid intervention brigade composed of troops from South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania.
For its part, the Staff of the FARDC has been redesigned and the army went on the offensive against the M23, making change the course of the war.
The pace of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end," predicts an expert in Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic - this is the first time that the Kinshasa government managed to fight a major insurgency.
And this would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, who fiercely denies, militarily support the M23, initially composed of former Congolese soldiers mutinied.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, called Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, said a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had raised the possibility of military reprisal for shells fell in Rwanda.
Wednesday, residents of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance FARDC soldiers.
"We spent a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us one day be released from the army," said one resident of this locality bordering Uganda.
"We lived in terror (M23), we are traumatized," said the man.
John Kerry admitted unprecedented that American spy "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry has indicated a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States vis-√†-vis its monitoring programs admitting an unprecedented, that on several occasions, espionage "had gone too far inappropriately" .
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of incendiary revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about espionage NSA has emerged.
Leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have read some things on autopilot because that we had the opportunity, during the Second World war and to the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course 11. "
He became the first senior member of the government of the United States to admit that American espionage had gone too far, but insisted that the rights of each were not violated.
He said: "In some cases, this has gone too far inappropriately. "
And the President is committed to try to clarify and make clear to people that now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels cheated.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, on the fact that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up. "
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow and attack governments.
And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We indeed had prevented from falling, buildings exploding and people being murdered because we could get the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the case and alleged U.S. spy convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight against terrorism with the United States, said Thursday the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and he was concerned about the threats that had been made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations in because of the feeling of frustration with the monitoring of the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and President of the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the U.S. Senate, in an interview from Washington.
And I am going to Europe for good to them that we must continue to work together to fight against terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programs.
The press reported that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has strained relations with certain allies of the United States, however, the agency's director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported by Snowden documents disclosed by which the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence James Clapper, has justified the espionage allies stating that it was necessary and it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of tumult, Murphy said his office organized a trip of Congress, to be held this year, and he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participants legislators should be unveiled in the coming days.
He said that the route remains to be defined.
Murphy said that the purpose of this trip was to help improve relationships, but also to show "tough love."
He explained that European leaders should be honest with their citizens about the type of spy programs they apply themselves for years.
"We can change our monitoring programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not alone in the world of spying," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Kerry was scheduled to visit this weekend in the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment caused by U.S. policies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the monitoring of States States.

For the CEO of Titan, "the proposed purchase of Goodyear Amiens starts with zero employee"
After throwing in the towel with a bang in January for the partial recovery site Amiens Goodyear North promised closure, Maurice Taylor, CEO of the U.S. tire manufacturer Titan, said he now ready to save 333 jobs the 1137 account that the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of productive recovery, already announced, Monday, Oct. 21.
Having renounced the proposed purchase of the plant in January, will return today.
You had spoken of violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers" who "work three hours" a day, "crazy" unions, to the CGT.
We do not understand this about-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I do try to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who tries to save manufacturing jobs among the highest paid.
If I hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high tax and unemployment level also.
The Truth Will she hurt?
Work seven hours a day when other countries are working eight hours handicaps France.
India, China and many other countries, working ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural tires, has good facilities, is well located and has space to expand.
Why Titan as he needs this plant?
Titan does not need to buy the plant.
But with proper and competent workers prices, it's worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance package, I think that 100% of employees would have accepted.
Now imagine that Titan buys Goodyear plant closed.
Therefore, Titan could move machines to Poland or any other country of the European Union still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
Now he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit among the approximately 1,200 current employees of Goodyear.
As Mr. Montebourg he need a commitment of Titan before trying to bring the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on severance benefits for all employees.
Therefore, there will be more people in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were willing to guarantee these 333 jobs over four years.
Do you confirm?
The only number I mentioned to the minister, this is 333.
I know he wants a four-year warranty.
But, as I have said, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance.
If all employees accept the proposed purchase of the plant starts with zero employee.
How can we provide guarantees of job duration when there is no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg achieved that the CGT and agree Goodyear and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens North over four years.

The Supreme Court validates the Law Reform Obama Health
Great victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that the law reform health ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Protection and Affordable Care patients) - which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, under penalty of to pay a fine - and said it was constitutional under the taxation power of the government.
President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, agreed to the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also approved the other sections of the Act of 2700 pages and, moreover, considered that the provision of the law reform of the health system, which states that it is necessary to lower the threshold for eligibility for Medicaid under or lose all federal funding of the program was coercive under the constitution.
The procedure to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates for president in the running in the primary of 2012, including the nominee Mitt Romney, were vehemently opposed to the law.
Aretha Franklin will go up on stage in December
The Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21 at the hall Sound Board MotorCity Casino Hotel.
Ms. Franklin case in November to record an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease from which she suffered, the famous interpreter of Respect had told the media on October 16 that the side effects of treatment she received was "difficult".
She claims to be "happy to be back."
Should teach children myths and legends as "models lifestyle," says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "brute force does not measure up to the subtle ruse", while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths are "too violent, too shocking and in some cases, far too obscene to be taught in school," Crossley-Holland called a "careful selection" of works suited to the age.
"I think it's great that in America, myths and folklore already be part of the education," he said.
I am in favor of this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are "openly didactic" that children "completely drop" messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, qui a traduit Beowulf de l'anglo-saxon et a √©crit The Penguin Book of Norse Myths et British Folk Tales, a d√©clar√©¬†: ¬´¬†Vous avez peut-√™tre de bonnes intentions, mais vous pr√©f√©rez les garder hors de vue.¬†¬ª
Maybe the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or end well, but there is a innate sense of right and wrong.
And it must be sublimated revealed through a story rather than stated.
Known based on what you watch and you do not say.
Green light from the United States to the merger Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they have received no objection from the U.S. authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger brings into effect the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe today announced the expiry review of the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," announce the two groups said in a statement.
They also state that they have received the necessary approvals in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.

New proposed class action against the brothers Holy Cross
A new proposed class action was filed against the brothers Sainte-Croix, concerning sexual assault reportedly took place this time at the St. Joseph's Oratory and several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application relies on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J"., Allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher's brother submitted, then by confessor, Father Bernard, the St. Joseph's Oratory, where he was an altar boy and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was that the three institutions, and when we announced the settlement, many people have told us? "Me, I was in such a place, is that I can write", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends victims in both cases.
The class action has been filed has the particularity to enable the addition of plaintiffs any facility where abuse could be perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.
At present, the application meets the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the brothers St. Croix.
The facts alleged are generally older than those mentioned in the first action, since many of the institutions mentioned have closed in the 1960s.
The resort also emphasizes that the Congregation of Holy Cross and Saint Joseph's Oratory, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse are perpetrated against children," they "exercised moral, religious and psychological stress on the victims, "they" were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and were still stifled, "and they" knowingly and consciously chose to ignore the problem. "
These latest charges are based on, among other letters written by the lawyer brothers Holy Cross Me √âmile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by research conducted in the archives about the brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Holy Cross who has publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the stage of admissibility in Superior Court.
Once the admissibility accepted by the Court, we proceed to the second stage, the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Holy Cross has agreed to settle amicably before hearings are conducted on the bottom.
DR Congo: Army preparing a new assault
Children playing on a charred armored which belonged to rebels M23 in Kibumba, October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday to a new assault against the last strongholds of the rebels M23 near Bunagana in eastern DRC.
The aim is to remove the M23 hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill Bugina, which overlooks the Mbuzi.
Today Mbuzi should fall itself.
There will be more than the hill Runyonyi.
"That of Chanzu is not very strategic," said the AFP was the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Saturday Bunagana.
Political stronghold and the last stronghold of the rebellion, this resort is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 miles north of Goma.
It was taken Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred diehard M23 are entrenched at nearly 2,000 meters above sea level on the hills of agricultural Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the neighboring village of Jomba
A Jomba, a resident who had reported fighting very close all day Thursday said the situation was "calm since this morning."
According to him, a woman and her child were killed in the fighting of the previous day and were buried.
One girl was shot and three other people were injured, one seriously, evacuated by the FARDC, added the witness quoted by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between rebels and FARDC October 25, the two sides gave no report of casualties.
The court blocks a decision on the policy control and search NYPD
A federal appeals court Thursday blocked a judge decision requiring changes in the control program and search the police department in New York and was removed from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the United States (second circuit) has indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was stayed pending the outcome of the appeal by the city call.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The city has appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to help the police department to change its policy and training program associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments Tuesday on the request for suspension.
The Court of Appeal held that the judge should be removed from the case because it has breached the Code of Judicial Conduct compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which it publicly reacted to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their program of stop and search.
She pointed to an external controller to oversee the changes, including reform policy, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in areas where happening the highest number of controls.
In August, the city of New York has agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases are rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the appeal by the city should take place after March 14, 2014.
Tactical control and the search was criticized by many civil rights.
This control system and search there for decades in some form, but the number of registered controls has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest level in 2011 with 684,330 controls which were mainly black and Hispanic men.
Legal action was filed in 2004 by four men, all from minorities and turned into collective action.
Supporters advocating changes in the control program and search NYPD say they will end the unfair practices will be more effective and which we trust police and may change the way departments Police wear policy.
Opponents say the changes would undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and would not solve the broader police under pressure after that the number of police officers were greatly reduced during problem the last decade.
The judge said she did not put an end to practices stop and search, which are constitutional, but reformed how the NYPD was implementing controls.
The revelations of the NSA increasing paranoia companies with regard to the monitoring of State
On a beautiful day in late August, a helicopter of the German police flew low over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the national agency of German intelligence, his mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media explain that BfV hoped identify the presence of listening antennas and the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Office in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence, insisted again in September on the fact that the United States do not use their capabilities for foreign intelligence "stealing trade secrets from foreign companies on behalf of companies U.S. to increase their international competitiveness and increase their profits. "
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant became informant, began to reveal its inexhaustible wealth of information about the secret surveillance of U.S., European governments and business leaders do not know whether to believe Director word.
Reports, according to which the National Security Agency U.S. spied the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. service providers of cloud storage, including Google and Yahoo, more than ever sparked paranoia companies in respect of state surveillance.
The revelation that the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been hacked, perhaps for a decade, was the straw that broke the camel's back.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, while business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden made ‚Äã‚Äãtransparent intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses.
I think it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Gr√ºn, President BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States is as important as China when it comes to industrial and data theft espionage, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY risk.
However all documents unveiled by Mr. Snowden, no evidence to date that the United States has sent trade secrets of foreign companies to U.S. companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern at the idea that the EU does not have sufficient computer skills and Internet and think it should strive to reduce its dependence vis-√†-vis the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about it.
A member of the German parliament said that we should create a German Google.

"This is not the right way to do," said Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company enterprise, SAP.
If a strong IT industry in Europe we wanted, then he should not let it die there 20 years.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, coal cars, passing by farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by the revelations of Snowden was a shock to some companies that previously thought that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A big change is happening in cloud computing as European leaders have realized that the data stored in the United States are governed under the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-US users have given up their plans to use an American provider of cloud storage after the revelations about the U.S. exploration program Prism data.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: "Our customers now ask us a question they did not ask us there one year: where my data being stored and can you assure me that physically remain in this jurisdiction? ".
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are a confirmation of what they already knew, that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and such data should therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that economic espionage.
There always has been.
"This is a recurring theme for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the present discussion," said Kurt Bock, CEO of the company producing chemicals BASF.
Americans spy on us on the trade and industry as we spy on, as it is in the national interest to protect our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal preventive measures they have in place in case the advantage would leave an opponent.

Ulrich Hackenberg, Member of the Board of Directors automaker Audi says that the collection of cell phones before board meetings, so they can not be used as listening devices remotely, is a common practice for years.
The BfV Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid cell phones when traveling abroad because of the risk to the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid cell phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium enterprises are vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect their trade secrets against unauthorized access," warns the BfV in a report.
U.S. warn their own societies on economic espionage activities conducted by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted in February by the United States, citing France, as well as Russia and Israel guilty to second degree have performed acts of piracy economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French domestic intelligence agency, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies. "
A tax on foreign property owners to burst the bubble of London
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the extent of tax capital gains but expects a final decision by Mr Osborne in the 2012 Budget, scored a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than 2 million ¬£ and annual fees for buyers who choose to hold property through a company rather than as individuals.
Stamp duty already applies to residential properties boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and is ¬£ 708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, the country of Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber region together.
Mr Cook said: "Following the increase in stamp duty on properties of high value and the introduction of anti-avoidance legislation in this area, it is very difficult to argue that the high value properties are sub-imposed independently of the effects of the system of obsolete housing tax. "
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuying property in London or current owners reluctant to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãselling," said he added.
The luxury real estate - 5 to 10% of the highest in the real estate market prices - in the prosperous area south-west London which stretches from Fulham Wimbledon, increased by a record percentage 11.8% over last year.
Prices in central London show steady growth year on year by 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an "internal market" in growing the southwest of the city, the north (7.4% ) and east (6.5%) experiencing a recovery, according to Savills research.
The shutdown in the U.S. has slowed the rise of the automobile market
Closing for 16 days for most federal government has weighed on growth in car sales in the U.S. in October, show figures released Friday by the manufacturers, five of the six major who have produced lower than expected performance.
The big three Detroit automakers show a double-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts on average expected 15.4 million sales annualized and seasonally adjusted but the market stood at 15.3 million estimated Adam Jonas, analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to clients of the bank, he believes that this slight slowdown can be explained primarily by "the 'shutdown' government and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first half of the month."

A study to increase the benefits of HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that the high-speed services to Scotland and Northern England will start from the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transportation Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "would bring the United Kingdom."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" at the prospect of working with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government has revised upwards the estimated cost of construction of the high speed link between London and the north of England, from ¬£ 32.7 billion to ¬£ 42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the improvement of rail capacity and improve journey times for the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the opportunity to journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh more than three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 provides a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities. "
We push the HS2 project because its advantages are enormous.
Without it, we face a problem of capacity of our rail network.
But it is also to develop connectivity between 18 major UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better with HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. "
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to support "unequivocal" the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed rail has the potential to provide significant economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall project of high-speed rail network throughout Britain.
"We are excited to be working in partnership with the British government to examine options to bring the network high-speed train to Scotland, creating a benefit to all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
"I'm looking forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year and then we will decide together the next steps. "
UN welcomes new objectives for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now be put to work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were established 12 years ago to fight against poverty world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in highlighting the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development which began yesterday in Rio de Janeiro .
They appeared in the final draft of the document to be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, during the summit.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit it was time to "go beyond national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process to set targets for universal sustainable development (ODD)," said he added.
These ODD will build on the progress made in the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the development framework post-2015.
I will do my best to fulfill the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Parents of intersex children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for infants born with ambiguous genitalia.
The male and female newborns will no longer assigned, rigidly at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to report the sex of their child, allowing them to enter an "undetermined" "unspecified" on his birth certificate or sex.
The purpose of the Act was to remove the pressure off the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sex reassignment surgery for their infant, and to fight against discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersexed person would say years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman. "
What I will stay the patchwork created doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 babies each year, is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersex part of the group of sixty diagnosed as disorders of sexual development disease, an umbrella term for people with chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testes) atypical or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could be intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the U.S. say that when sex can not be determined, it is better to use the best available information to assign, and then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering surgery, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist at New York and a specialist in gender identity issues, said that the new German law "seems like a good idea."
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from very serious illnesses that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sex assignment without operation, and how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very accurate.
Nobody can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery surrounding homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described the various intersex people as transgender or transsexual people, as their status is not related to sex but their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man or exclusively that of a woman, but is usually both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and genitals) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced intersex and transgender people in employment, and the extent of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Boys of non-conforming gender now have camps that are specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, an Australian 52 years, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as a "neutral" after winning his appeal that allows him to keep an 'unspecified' sex life.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F - X intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report aired on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers this fundamentally Catholic countries have signed a petition that "gender theory" be removed from the textbooks.
U.S. Catholic Online website also opposed to German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new kingdom where gender is a choice, but where sexual activity is not one, it reverses two pillars of civilization. "
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also said she would prefer to Baby Zone that sex is attributed to babies at birth.
"Being a parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your baby," she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs are called hermaphrodites, named after the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And there is barely a decade, the medical community considers gender as a slate that can be erased and which can redraw.
But now there are many who question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and sometimes doctors may err, not knowing how a child will feel when his sexual reassignment grow.
"In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," said Drescher.
When these children were born, we did not call the psychiatrist, we telephoned the surgeon.
The prevailing theory on how to treat children provided with ambiguous genitalia was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins, who considered that gender is malleable.
He dedicated the term "gender identity" and argued that the social and environmental signals - how parents raise a child - interact with genes and hormones of a child for the shape so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a case of 1966, known as the "John / Joan" his theories led to controversy.
He advised parents to a little boy whose penis had been cut during a botched circumcision do fully castrate him also removing the testicles, and raise him as a girl.
"Money has presented this as a case of successful transition, but this was not the case," said Drescher.
At the age of about 15 years, it is again a boy and married a woman.
But at age 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "always repeat this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived the sex change operations say "[that] they are not satisfied with the result."
Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36 year old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors could not really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never have a "good life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testes and was raised as a girl.
He was made to take female hormones at the age of 12 years.
"I knew I was not a girl" Has he told ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked his medical records.
What he discovered horrified.
I was sterilized at birth - and nobody had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sex development (DSD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he is a man again, following treatment with testosterone and has been removed breasts.
Surgery made ‚Äã‚Äãhim sterile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to standardize the collection of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the nonprofit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that the German law "invites labeling and stigmatization."
"Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an" indeterminate "sex," she has said.
We fear it encourages interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law would give, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said his organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the name third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind," she added.
German law for the allocation of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should lead to that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a disorder of sexual development and helps thousands of people in a support group radiologist said that German law "will empower" parents and children.
The daughter of Dr. Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a syndrome called DDS complete androgen insensitivity.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
It has a vagina, but not ovary or uterus.
Today aged 29, Katie is married and internal child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption or surrogacy services.
"The law leaves room for parents to not have to make hasty decisions," said Baratz.
This gives them time to do some tests and understand, and a delay before recording "masculine" or "feminine".
So far so good - you can raise your child and love.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You do not have to rush to surgery that is irreversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what it takes," she has said.
Finally, the child decide with which sex he / she feels / most comfortable - and this is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a rifle Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 years were going door to door demanding candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the district visited by Muy children opened the door holding his shotgun.
The old man, aged 86, told police he had been afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change
He said Obama has made ‚Äã‚Äãcommendable efforts thwarted by the obstructionism of the Republican Party
The obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties Site Obamacare, or drone attacks
The memory of the 2008 Obama campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a frightfully sad these days book.
This is a book that I thought would encourage me in the gloom of the second year of medicine and would restore me hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and it is the memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.
When I finished the medical reports of my patients at night and I go to bed, this book key back to me when policies inspired millions of people and where speeches were breathtaking.
The election ended in a landslide victory and presenters newspapers news took time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.
My comrades wept with joy and my parents kept all the papers they found.
A young team of visionaries advancing toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the Obama transition before taking office in 2008, he had 82% approval rating.
And then I close the book.
Return to this is a rude awakening is like waking from a dream.
It is hard to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change has really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I put the Obama credit great achievements since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) until the departure from Iraq of our army, through the end of "neither seen nor known" and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation in the field of immigration reform, the public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defended the Obama administration to face my peers and colleagues, I am unable to provide an explanation.
I'm on the verge of political despair.
The Republican filibuster can not explain the tapping foreign leaders, nor the aliens attack innocent children by drones.
She can not explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who disclose government wrongdoing.
It can not justify the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen without trial or evasion of public funding and exceeding authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
It can not justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the White House to reduce to silence the media are "more aggressive ... since the Nixon administration."
And, more recently, it can not excuse the failure to design a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I do not know if this is what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable because the political opposition and the events that occur by chance, as the massacre of Newton party influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
This is what bothers me the most.
I have to vote for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney had a confused and poorly refined alternative that does not seem possible to determine its policies or positions.
I felt Obama was elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, held the promise that we heard about for so long.
Yet, while the index of favorable opinions dipped below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me wish that the many promises are gone.
This week, I read part of the book describes how Obama has suffered huge losses to Clinton in Pennsylvania Primary.
At a meeting post-campaign, he told his team that they had to get back on track and stay loyal to their cause.
"I want us recentrions our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
Here we are 5 years later, Mr. Speaker, and I'm not agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
New Star has managed a comeback, hearings side, with 1.3 million viewers behind the TV set, a 5.6% audience share.
But the show was he meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates were auditioned this 10th season, to face the jury: Keane, the villain Sinclair, perched Andr√© Manoukian and Olivier Holland.
On Twitter, viewers have shared their comments.
Increased excitement to find their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored in the first premium.
As every year, the first broadcasts hearing brew a wide range of aspiring singers, for better and sometimes for worse.
But on Twitter, we want entertainment, emotion, originality, music ...
Fortunately, some have found their account.
They are likely to have attempted New Star, and sometimes be gone through.
Behind the television screens, vocations successful singer are still there, season after season.
Others just ambition to make people laugh.
RBS suspended two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two of its traders forex market division according to two sources familiar with the matter, which shows once again that global regulators investigation into suspected manipulation of the currency market is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators as part of investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $ 5.3 trillion U.S. changes hands every day.
Both traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of the enlargement of the investigation that echoes the scandal manipulation of Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month have received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators," said a representative of the bank there two weeks.
Last month, sources close to the matter said that RBS had transmitted the records of emails and instant messages sent to and from a former trader, the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and have been suspended from his post as head of European cash trading for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of currency spot trading at Citi, has been on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders have been no charges.
The case of Mr. Usher included instant messages sent and bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources familiar with the matter.
UBS said this week that it had commenced an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator FINMA said it was investigating suspected market manipulation exchange in a number of banks Swiss.
Worldwide, at least six authorities - the European Commission, FINMA, the Swiss competition authority Weko, FCA, the U.S. Justice Department and the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong - examine allegations concerning bankers would have agreed to manipulate the market rate of exchange.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, said sources familiar with the matter.
Banks pare instant messages and emails sent from years to find cases of wrongdoing.
The news about these investigations have shaken traders in an area that was one of the biggest drivers of growth units trading investment banks in recent years, but has been challenged this year due the low currency volatility which limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the matter by saying that it is almost impossible to handle the vast market highly liquid exchange, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity across platforms exchange management and the use of increasingly frequent by banks for their own platforms internal "explains that it is possible to begin to have an impact on the market at low cost."
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it has returned a trader working in his office traded funds the London Stock Exchange this week after it caused a loss of $ 6 million at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
"We believe that the trader acted alone and that the case was brought under control," said a representative of Credit Suisse.
A Chinese newspaper has called "will be redrafted"
A Chinese newspaper has called on the first page for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be revamped, says a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen admitted by the television after he had accepted bribes, kickbacks to fabricate stories about a semi-public company.
At present, the New Express will undergo a "complete overhaul," said the regulator.
The order of "overhaul" comes from the administration of Guangdon for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the group Yangcheng Evening News had published several articles on the erroneous Zoomlion listed between September 2012 and August 2013 company.
"Drafting New Express was disorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
He said he had decided to "impose an administrative sanction imposed Chen Yongzhou withdrawing her press card."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that investigates those responsible at New Express immediately and adjusts the management team of the newspaper."
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express on alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published twice a call on the first page for his release, he supported his writing journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on public television where he admitted having published false stories against money.
"In this case, I hurt Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain the trust of public," he told public television network CCTV.
I did mainly because I was running after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following an apology from Mr. Chen, New Express published its apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several key suspects were recently televised confessions.
Experts say that people are always forced to make confessions, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year banning the authorities to force anyone to incriminate himself.
Obama backtracked on his reform of the health system
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday on his promise unambiguous and often repeated that "if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people have received notice of termination of their service, the Republicans have criticized the president in recent days, accusing him of misleading the American people.
Hier, Barack Obama Fitted sa promesse d'origine.
"The vast majority of people holding health insurance that suits them can keep it," said he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a buzz in the news" about cancellations, President Obama urged Americans who received these reviews to find a new insurance market.
Most people can obtain comprehensive health plans and better suited for the same price or for even cheaper than expected.
"You come out a winner," said he said.
The Administration announced that no one should be surprised if 5% of the population who get their insurance themselves found themselves forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me speak directly to those Americans: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius during his testimony before the Committee on Energy and Commerce in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the October launch of the online market had failed "miserably".
"I'm as frustrated and angry as anyone," she has said.
I look forward to regain your confidence.
This is Kathleen Sebelius exasperated that gave this sentence then she thought his microphone cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the meeting of the Assembly yesterday following an exchange of points issue for Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, whether it should join the Obamacare.
For over three hours, Billy Long has continued to press for Ms. Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived insurance sponsored by the government to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, it now boasts millions of Americans.
The tribute to folk Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" the Coen brothers, Grand Prize of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich Village folk music in 1961 and just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography comes to the subject of a retrospective at the French Cin√©math√®que, had won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Failing to hire Dylan or trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have set their sights on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.
Full of humor in this film where music is a central character and the songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals a musician and folk singer performed while Timberlake, his friend in the film, even pop to folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich trappings of Mulligan Daisy in "The Great Gatsby" for clothes less shining, a soft voice when she sings, but the curse charged a machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells a week tribulations of a folk singer who is unable to penetrate and be angry with the whole world.
It accepts backwards replacements at short notice in the studios.
Homeless, he toured the sofa of his friends who want to receive it yet.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what interested us: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, not careerist but integrates with self-destructive behavior," said to Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel several Oscars and awards at Cannes press.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers fans of folk music have built their story on real personalities of the time such as folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the time before the advent of Greenwich Village, this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNew York called to become "the epicenter of the development of folk music that would create international stars" as written by the journalist Elijah Wald , friend Van Ronk.
The film then looks like a documentary, dusty music label invaded 33T unsold inhabited by an old priceless secretary, the choice of music studios of the time and cafes where occurred the singers.
Magic Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character throughout the film constantly: a beautiful red cat cute look, companion fortune Llewyn Davis.
Asked about how he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grown up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country."

Chevron, the second U.S. oil company, reported Friday a decline in quarterly profit due to the decline in refining margins, while its production of oil and gas increased while remaining back against targets group.
Its net income for the third quarter decreased to $ 4.95 billion, or 2.57 per share, against $ 5.25 billion, or $ 2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters on average expected earnings per share of $ 2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier products.
The company aims to 2.65 million bpd this year, with growth of 25% of production expected by 2017.
The major part of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Because of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by seven billion dollars in two years and should reach $ 36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities fell slightly in the third quarter, while the profits of downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell 45% to $ 380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Thus, the main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil said Thursday a net profit down, despite rising production of oil and gas.

NSA Spying: the United States is "gone too far," admits Kerry
The United States are sometimes went "too far" in espionage, recognized the Secretary of State, John Kerry, in the first admission of Washington in full debate with Europe on the massive collection of data by the Agency national security (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a U.S. government official admits explicitly controversial practices in NSA interception of communications and data Europe.
"In some cases, I admit, as did the President, some of these actions have gone too far and we will ensure that this happens more in the future," said John Kerry during ' a conference in London in which he participated from Washington Thursday, October 31 via video link.
In his speech broadcast in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified the practices of information and data collection by the need to combat terrorism and prevention against possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in Madrid in March 2004, and London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the U.S. authorities had been foiled many planned attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and gathering information.
"We have been prevented from falling aircraft, as buildings explode and people are murdered, because we were able to be aware of these upstream projects," argued the head of the diplomacy U.S..
And John Kerry said at the Europeans, "I assure you that in the process of innocent people were not deceived."
But we strive to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, this has gone too far inappropriately" still allowed the Secretary of State, who had already had to comment on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said Thursday night that President Obama was "committed to try to clarify and he proceeded to review these practices so that no one feels cheated."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
The newspaper, citing documents obtained from the ex-NSA consultant Edward Snowden says the baptized "MUSCULAR", and carried out with the British counterpart of the NSA program, GCHQ allows these two agencies retrieve data from the optical fibers used by internet giants.
To believe one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected during the single month of January - from metadata on e-mail, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection with these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy, have revealed that the NSA had intercepted massive data and communications from allies of the United States and its leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Face the wrath of European countries and while leaks in the American press claimed that the U.S. President was not aware of such plays, Barack Obama has refused to speak about it, citing national security.
For cons, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, he denied that his intelligence agency has picked up tens of millions of European citizens communications.
He even returned the ball to European intelligence services that would be seized of these communications, before providing the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this does not would target Europe, the general said Alexander.
And the controversy extended Friday Asia.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spy network which has also attracted the ire of China.
Early puberty earlier Aging
Studies show that young African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be a trigger of precocious puberty
The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and health issues in children.
A mother should she worry if the breasts and pubic hair of her daughter start to grow 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, Soil endocrinologist, said that these early physical changes are fairly common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards puberty," said Kaplowitz.
Obvious signs of development, such as the budding breasts, the hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been a slight advance of the age of menarche in the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, when he was 12 years three quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest began to grow, it takes at least two or three years before menarche appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This common Problem ".
Time is the most accurate test to find out how you expect puberty.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by a sudden increase before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows down or stops - this is something that a pediatrician can monitor.
Faster evolution can justify tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems like tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of menarche and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and short stature in adulthood.
Recommendations on drug and hormone therapy are based on age, the rate of development, growth and emotional maturity child.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with medications but recognizes that "the control of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and feel for girls to be different from others."
The other major problem is understandable: Parents just do not want their young girls have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about rules, it was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school frightened and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the attention of the public on the causes of precocious puberty.
However, there is no coherent theory that the hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are responsible.
Boys like girls reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says that the most plausible hypothesis is that the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 years linking the percentage of fat in the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, the young African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions in climate, through the genes.
Another problem: Although boys have facial hair and the younger pubic area, the trend towards a true precocious puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the conference PAA emphasized the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even among infants and toddlers.
"We must be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist working at Children's Hospital Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician to know how to talk with their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you remain calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls with precocious puberty should be reassured that, even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life.

A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Kidnapped in Beirut March 8, 1986 with three members of his team "Antenne 2" came to film a demonstration of Hezbollah, the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 to the creation of the association for the defense of the hostages "Hostages of the world", he chaired for several years.
Its main objective: get the opportunity for the hostages to complain and bring their hostage takers before the International Criminal Court.
Held for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of AQIM (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Marc Feret and Pierre Legrand were released Tuesday.
After medical examinations of the Val-de-Gr√¢ce Wednesday afternoon military hospital, they have since reunited with their families.
And try gradually to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Hostages of the world."
On the evening of your release, you were on the set of 20h of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of today's release?
Including on-site in Beirut.
When I am free, I found in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's dark - Roger Auque.
He told me "it is released," but I'm not sure, and tell me that you can still be killed.
We are very excited, but also very tight.
This is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They lay us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There Syrian military.
Then we arrive at the site of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
Lead us to the French embassy of France.
This is the time of the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the media ...
I remember taking a bath for one hour.
And having dinner in t-shirt to the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night talking with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate us to the airport of Larnaca in Cyprus.
Arrived there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu Solenzara where Pasqua ships.
How did you arrive on French soil?
On atterrit √† Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is there.
It's a bit brutal.
There is an incredible rush.
And lots of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I come back and there are plenty.
The descent of the stairs of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, this is extremely strong emotion.
Between the airport and home, many bikes after our car Roussin conduit.
The bikers pull the floss to take pictures and follow me home where I do a little police to prevent certain to rise.
The media pressure is enormous.
It does not stop, we are well placed to know ...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is that it is difficult to see clearly.
It leaves a hole and we are suddenly in the media spotlight.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, pretty complex to manage.
But it was the hardest.
The same evening, I'm 20h, the next day so I'm on TV.
Then begins a kind of readjusting to life very gently for a month or two that are a bit like a vacation.
How were medical examinations and debriefing DGSE?
I got a first medical examination in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Gr√¢ce the following days my return radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
This is not a session that does everything but we know we can count on him, remember if necessary, we are not left to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostage takers.
It was logical.
It did not bother me.
How do you react today the release of four hostages in Niger?
I listen to what is being said.
The debate on such ransoms.
Some things annoy me, others less so.
I try to distinguish between the things about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the association "Hostages of the world" that allows me to put distance, and seems much more interesting address.
I wonder, for example, the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight with others, to recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
There is in my opinion a problem of semantics.
Must qualify the hostage of "political" hostages - which is the case most of the time - and allow hostages to access to justice, to complain and to bring their policy holders hostages before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and looks forward to the release of these hostages.
But who said that the hostages could perhaps have also access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made ‚Äã‚Äãfor this.
Why do not you say to hostage takers "you violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, it will bring you to justice?"
It seems to me, however founded, legitimate hit sense.
This message is heard but not listened to, and it offends me.
This is my main battle.

A La Seyne, relocation because of the controversy revolves rats
Earlier this week, a family left his apartment on the ground floor of the building Fructidor D2, due to the presence of rats.
Given the urgency of the situation, the Director of the Office of the South Lands Habitat, proposed an exceptional and temporary basis, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refused "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case took exaggerated proportions, says Joel Canapa, director of the Office.
Rats, there has always been in cities.
The company makes two passages ratting year, and in addition we work in our office, every request of residents.
We have made ‚Äã‚Äãsince the end of last winter, 64 interventions.
The area is not neglected, and rats do not abound in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, rodenticides are four times less effective than in the past, certainly, but for two rats, we will not kill a kid.
"We have not invited rats at home," defends the father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We soon broke and we expect a new home, the same price as the old one.
Royal Bank of Scotland internally create a bad bank ( "bad bank") comprising 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of riskier assets, measure to relax relations with London and accelerate its re-privatization.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of bad assets on its balance sheet in the next two years and hope to have it completely cleaned in three years.
RBS also said it would enter an additional provision for impairment of doubtful debts of four to ¬£ 4.5 billion in the quarter, a writing related to the establishment of the hive.
RBS has also stated that this internal restructuring would release 10-11000000000 book capital, strengthening its ability to lend.
Bank London and stressed that "bad bank" would draw a line under the past, the government has in particular been accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of assets that constitute a really good bank and build a large bank for customers and for the UK," said the new CEO Ross McEwan press.
George Kerevan: Bursting of Europe gives the choice to the Scots
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, it warns us that an independent Scotland would have to join the European area of freedom of movement in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control at Berwick and a border of barbed son along Hadrian's Wall.
While the newspaper Strathclyde said the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it does not yet appear in the headlines (and it was expected).
Nor did not say that the EU Member States spend much of their time around their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuous non-compliance would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in exchange for whatever she wants to get the Scots.
So this is a story that is not a.
And if it is ancient history now fixed: I heard for the first time the canard that "independence means passport control" there are more than 40 years.
However, we forgot an interesting point in this interpretation of a dusty old tale.
Why an independent Scotland should it follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London against that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great postwar plan to unify Europe is definitely stalled.
With the crisis of the euro, the European Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, the parties opposed to the EU or who advocate the abandonment of the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic party in Germany, founded only this year and out of nowhere, attracted nearly five million votes in federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent of our Liberal Democrats ) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the proposed creation of a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, the associated yoke on national economies through membership in the single currency, has led many people to think that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has not much to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - this was true only for Greece.
The European system rather imposes on its members in exchange rates favorable to German exporters - that German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are left with a problem of intrinsic productivity vis-√†-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make deep cuts in wages and public spending - encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - are a reason to subsidize French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer - the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more gas as the United States.
It is a crippling disadvantage in terms of cost, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry to be hit by a U.S. shale gas cheap.
Accordingly, the resistance is growing, particularly in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a means of controlling Germany and Paris put on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin does not need passport to Paris as its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy undermined struggle.
Result: the far-right party Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has won a crucial election, returning the Socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - a timely warning to the British Labour Party who reminds him he can not assume that a split on the right automatically favor the left.
What is Marine Le Pen with his new popularity with the French white working class?
She wants to use European elections next year to create a single currency and anti-anti-European in the European Parliament bloc.
If the anti-European parties are doing well in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's what I think: very soon, the anti-European sentiment and anti-single currency in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that is more like a "Europe of Nations (sovereign)" free privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, France and Southern Europe find their own currency.
I expect that the UK takes its distance from this project, and I hope it will make eyes at the United States.
However, the growing interest in Washington for the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left out in the Atlantic.
And Scotland in?
We can decide to be a region of Little England (mostly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, including sending walking Berlin and Brussels.
I think Scotland could live a freer Europe Agreement provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a Europe of non-federal Nations.
Otherwise, we should emulate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP Scottish Government is - and it should be noted - the anti-austerity has been most successful in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on his opposition to the proposed cuts (and made political movement implemented) by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Labour Alistair Darling and Conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now Scotland vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
A house on fire in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out Friday at noon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than thirty firefighters were dispatched to 9 of Hebert Street.
The flames were reported in a three-family house on four floors behind the courtyard of the Seminary of Quebec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.

End of service for the chef de l'Elys√©e
Entered in the 500 m2 of Elysian kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, Cook climbed the ranks to become chief there nine years.
He served six French presidents Georges Pompidou, Fran√ßois Hollande via Nicolas Sarkozy, including their vacation spots, and nurtured countless world leaders in virtual anonymity it breaks qu'aujourd Today, at the time of retirement at age 60.
The man with open face, bald head and glasses intellectual, born October 24, 1953 at La Ferte-Saint-Aubin holds a CAP pastry.
His mother was herself a cook in a castle Sologne.
"I went to a castle on the other!" Quips Vaussion Bernard, who not only knows the quirks of six Presidents for which he served, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"This is still the head of state or his girlfriend or wife who chooses the menu," he says.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, it came directly in the kitchen", so that it had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysee!
No offense to the Heads of State showed a relative indifference to earthly food, "they are all greedy", denounces Bernard Vaussion nicely.
Jacques Chirac was certainly "a little more developed appetite."
But Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese plates came back empty!
As for Francois Hollande, who restored the cheese, "is someone who loves to eat" and "there is not much he does not like."
The current head of state, who has regained the lost pounds before the presidential campaign, "did not request specific regime."
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure off his shoulders, especially during state dinners at the Elys√©e must serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour."
The night before is almost white.
These people do not understand that there are errors.
The now former executive chef of the Elysee, which took a drink Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, share with a heavy heart. "Fran√ßois Hollande came to greet me."
He said praise.
"His human side came out," he says.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, William Gomez, 35, who for his part for seventeen years at the Elysee.

The investigation of Mayor Rob Ford was botched, says lawyer
After the police had confirmed that he got hold of a copy of the video that show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby argued he had never seen an investigation "as sloppy."
I believe Ruby told The Canadian Press that police had "ignored or downplayed" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested the friend and occasional driver Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and was accused of extortion in relation to the video.
Alexander Lisi previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed this man delivering parcels to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Mr. Ruby has described as "inexplicable" that the police had never searched the vehicle Rob Ford or domicile, or tapped his phone, claiming that Police Chief Bill Blair has chosen knowingly not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, who witnessed suspicious transactions by hand, could very well get the vehicle to Rob Ford, the mayor stop, and make a search - even without a warrant.
It could also require a term of instant search, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called the About Me Ruby "obvious and desperate attempt" to enforce the media in a matter that concerns him no.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said there was nothing in this video that may constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to the filing of criminal charges against the mayor.
A veteran of the armed wing of Hamas was killed tonight and another wounded by Israeli tank fire in Gaza, has-been learned medical and security sources in Gaza.

German journalists invited to escape Google and Yahoo
The union of German journalists Thursday urged its members to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the American and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends journalists to avoid until further notice to use search engines and email from Google and Yahoo," she said in a statement.
She considers "scandalous" information from Washington Post, that the National Agency for American security (NSA) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) British collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both firms synchronize their servers.
"Research conducted by journalists as private as the coordinates of the sources and nature of their communications with them," said Michael Konken, president of the union claims 38,000 members.

While planners of the road network of the United States are struggling to find the money to repair the highway infrastructure in disrepair, many people who see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches to the top dashboard of your car.
Devices, which record all miles traveled by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices planning to revamp the outdated system of financing major U.S. highways.
The sector generally uninteresting planning pillars suddenly caused a very animated and alliances turbulent debate.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby the government to use small boxes to keep track of your miles, and possibly the road you are traveling on, and then use the information to write a tax bill.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern regarding the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress fail to agree on whether to continue, many states have not waited.
How they look during the next decade, they will move to a system allowing drivers to pay according to the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of motorists have already embarked those black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system for an experimental trip.
This is really essential for our nation.
"It is not as if we had a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, general manager of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the State begin recording the miles traveled by each motorist California 2025.
There will be change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do.
The pressure comes from the fact that the Highway Trust Fund in the country, financed with taxes that Americans pay at the pump is financially dry.
Americans are not buying as much fuel as before.
Cars can go more miles with a gallon.
Federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise taxes, even 1 percent, while gas prices are high.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a specialist in transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed tracers 500 cars to test a payment system mile.
"This appears to be the most logical long-term alternative," he has said.
Wonks call it a user fee for mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea deceive urban liberals, since taxes could be used to modify driving habits in order to reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California planners interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the ambitious goals set out in the laws of the state of global warming.
But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives, said he also considered the most viable long-term alternative.
Proponents of free market Reason Foundation also like the idea of charging drivers per mile.
"It is not simply a tax rushing into a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits that are afforded to them.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Secretaries of Transportation, which in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go in the way of payment mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a pilot project of $ 90 million last year which would have covered about 10,000 cars.
But the Speaker of the House killed the proposal, addressing the concerns of legislators representing rural voters who must travel many miles every day to get to work or around town.
Nevertheless, several states and cities are making progress on their side.
Most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry the largest country experience.
These drivers will soon pay the State fee mileage instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering a.
Illinois tried a test on a limited number of trucks.
And I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the U.S. east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) examines how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers motorists have recently equipped the car with a device, drivers were worried that the government can track their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and what kind of things are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategic performance management in the Department of Transportation Nevada.
This is not something that people want.
From the beginning of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices tracking devices in their own right. "
It is not necessary to build one that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of daily comings and goings of people huge and cumbersome technology infrastructure.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location nor the hour.
If we can do that, said Khan, citizens will be more comfortable.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-up in California called True Mileage.
Originally, the company does not intend to help motorists who pay taxes to the states.
She tried to break into the emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers pay based on their mileage.
But devices that test planners liked the main roads because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information downloaded periodically by modem.
"People are more likely to do that if you do not register their speed and do not locate," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Big mistakes were made in the pilot programs in certain states.
There are much cheaper ways and less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting by offering different drivers choice.
They can choose a unit with or without GPS.
They can still choose to have no camera at all, preferring instead to pay based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state plan.
Other states hope to sell the concept to unsuspecting citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In the city of New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a system of taxation that would be also equipped to pay parking fees, provide insurance "payment driving" and create a set of data on the real-time speed from other drivers and motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists are encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them," said a document on urban development.
However, some transportation planners wonder if the whole debate on pay per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the Bay Area of San Francisco, officials say that Congress could easily manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline.
A single extra fee or annual may be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and other vehicles that do not consume a lot of fuel, so that everyone pays their fair share.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs at the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
British police issue an extradition warrant against Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and applied for political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a "notice of allowance" against the Australian 40, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court struck down his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing Stockholm authorizes the transfer to the United States, he found refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London on June 19, asking the country to South America for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "issued a notice of surrender against a 40 year old man who asked him to report to a police station, date and time of their choice," said a spokesman .
He continues to violate the conditions of his bail.
The Embassy has declined to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying after unveiling more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website struggling against the secret information.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
The Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta judge that his government held until 2015 despite strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition to approach the Senate vote to deprive Berlusconi of his mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the center-left leader said he "fully intend" to continue to govern with its coalition until the next elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former Chairman convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw support to the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters say his dismissal.
But part of his camp, gathered around the national secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 his refusal to yield to the dictates of Berlusconi who wanted already to drop the cabinet.
For over a year, everywhere, I am able to find a strong dissatisfaction from the people I meet: monstrous revaluation of their properties, flood tax, cost of licenses of all kinds, administrative costs do endless.
In short, slurping limitless our pockets.
Millions of dollars wasted could be saved to allow a much respectful of those who pay taxes.
Any money forcibly removed taxpayers decreases their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all the major companies are not shy about the lavish spending and maintenance of lame ducks: Deficit cultural center, strong grant to the City of Energy, etc..
If these facilities are not profitable, that they sell to private enterprise or that the demolish.
It is also sad to see the expropriation of several properties to accommodate a major industry that never came.
However, I give an honorable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso in a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
This is not public levels to invest in such companies, but the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were happy to learn that the lakes Fisheries and Batteries will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
Following the departure of all industries (large consumers of water) and the general decline in population, water use has declined significantly throughout the territory.
No mean to waste, the city never fail to water and strict regulations regarding its use could be greatly mitigated.
In summary, it is very easy to achieve great things with other people's money.
I would be ashamed to defend such an assessment.
With a gross debt of over $ 200 million, the city is not even able to buy a pen without a debt settlement.
We managed for over 40 years by cravats with beautiful diplomas for most and I do not think a sheep farmer do worse.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday morning in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred at about 11 pm on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, the work done on the foundations were going to this place for some time.
Wall adjoining foundation had been built in the last days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived on site to retrieve his tools.
I was driving and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the site.
I landed and went to remove the large bricks that covered.
We saw only a part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to authorities, the victim is a child in her fifties who worked for a company shuttering man.
Resuscitation procedures were attempted by emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his injury.
An inspector from the Commission on Health and Safety at Work has been dispatched to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
NSA involves an "internal error" and not hackers to the failure of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadow said Friday that it was a bug that caused the failure of the public site for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error has occurred during a scheduled update," said the spy agency in a statement by email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the failure was due to an attack of DDoS [DSD] are false.
Earlier tonight, trackers online servers have noted that the site of the NSA had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still can not access the site.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the agency was "not at all" compromise.
No classified information is in danger, said the spokesman.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a target until the servers are overloaded site and the site collapses.
Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãtactic is not very sophisticated attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the affected system.
NSA once top secret, once nicknamed the "No Such Agency" came under the spotlight and strongly criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about his extensive monitoring programs communications nationally and abroad - that are part of the secret NSA files stolen from the agency and disclosed by disillusioned former consultant to the NSA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has caused much speculation that the incident that night was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
An investment fund that owned the building was sold to developers who will turn it into student housing.
Three hundred and fifty people working at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees.
Employers came to meet employees on the spot, we met individually with employees to assess their needs.
"This support then will continue for the next six months," said Regional Director of Labour Relations Delta Hotels, Felix Bisson.
The closure of Delta operates in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building then had choices to make.
It is reinvested in the building to continue to operate, so there was an investment of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have emerged in Montreal.
"Or is it sold to someone else and this is what happened," said Paul Arsenault, owner of the Transat Chair in Tourism at the School of Management Sciences at UQAM.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, as the Crown Plaza will become a home for the elderly.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will emerge within two years.
You want a neon ice?
A British entrepreneur has created the first fluorescent ice world based jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a light snack.
He got the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with language by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream begins to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the more it becomes shiny.
Charlie, the founder of ice "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "This is something unbelievable but we are still at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g this thing cost about ¬£ 200. "
The protein we use in ice reacts with language neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH increases and the ice begins to shine.
We tested it over the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with all the Halloween time because it gives a special shine effect.
This is probably the most expensive I have created because the luminescence of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold ice.
Each ball so cost me about ¬£ 140.
But it has pretty good taste!
The company with the experimental approach of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream flavors such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation will be even more ambitious.
He added: "I would really like to develop an invisible ice. "
It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that form ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to get there.
Ice using the fluorescent properties of the Medusa synthesized by Chinese scientists.
One seriously injured in an accident with a phantom driver on the Brussels ring
An accident was serious injured Friday morning around 5:30 on the inner ring of Brussels height Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
The car of a driver was hit by a ghost driver, it is free.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 am, at the place of the accident, the time that the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
This situation has hardly caused traffic jams because the accident took place at the height of Hoeilaart output.
Traffic has since been diverted by the input / output of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction at Disneyland Paris
A five year old child was seriously injured after an accident on an attraction at Disneyland Paris.
His prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed until further notice.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of U.S. monitoring
Edward Snowden, the informant of U.S. intelligence, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Str√∂bele Thursday met Mr. Snowden in Russia, where it enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the member has presented to the media in Berlin Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "While the results of my efforts has been any positive evidence, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as an escape and seeks to penalize political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend. "
However, the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he was accused of espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will work to make this possible. "
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained as a result of complaints that the NSA had wiretapped the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the member who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign intelligence services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as "witness without endangering and completely ruin the relationship with the United States ", he had to take.
Mr. Str√∂bele, German Green member, published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Str√∂bele said, according to the lawyer of former consultant of the NSA, Mr. Snowden would not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, it would assure him that he would be "security" there, said the MP.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a campaign of persecution "serious and sustained" that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global response to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials - including the United States - have found that the revelation of an inexplicable permanent monitoring system was of public utility.
The letter provides advance cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of the humanitarian situation had been resolved."
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphins off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux responsible for scientific mission to the Centre for the Study and Conservation of Marine Animals and Backgrounds (OCEAMM) returns to The Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
The discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin you she surprised?
This is good news, but it does not surprise me particularly.
While in the past, species have been described and identified on morphological basis, anatomical and geographical today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge of science of classifying species.
It is also not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology challenge the classification or membership of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are questioned because of advances in genetics.
Similarly, two morphologically very similar species were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species which has just been identified.
There ten years, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this sub-family: Pacific humpback dolphins and humpback whales in the Atlantic.
Recent analyzes have identified four species.
Why is it an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
If this population was already long known by the researchers, they did not know it was part of a new species, present only at that location.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or catch arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered in the number of individuals existing on Earth, that is to say, the stock, and the potential it has to recover from neighboring stocks.
Regarding the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species is discovered after his stock is automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous habitats, open, where there is many genetic exchange between populations and individuals.
This mixing of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, the more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can lead ultimately create new species.
You should know that the marine environment is the least well-known areas.
We prefer to send robots to Mars than to know what lives in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea
More money is spent in the search for life on other planets in marine research and it is high time that changed.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of parental leave.
The billionaire Clive Palmer MP argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of parental leave because his daughters might be pregnant and enjoy this system.
The mining magnate, who disputes the payment of a carbon tax in the amount of $ 6 million, has made ‚Äã‚Äãthis point to try to dismiss questions about a potential conflict.
Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding whether the carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could be a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott girls were ready to personally benefit from these policies.
"It will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to pay parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, it will have a direct interest in the fact that it obtains or not leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission has officially stated that Mr. Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes after a recount.
Mr. Palmer has advanced the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa system redesign flank of the vote to accelerate the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
This election should it be decided two months after the voting is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why do we not have a system in which you can enter, enter your details into a computer vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 in the morning?
Mr. Palmer has also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is that clear to the result if someone does not agree?
Nowadays, having a pencil looks amazing.
The Electoral Commission has explored options regarding electronic voting and has recently published a paper joint reflection with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and would take his new "very seriously" functions.
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We do not seek reward except the reward of the story as we serve the community at a critical time," he added.
When many experts equestrian events met in Cardiff to compete and win the trophy Horse of the year, they knew that the competition would be tough.
But nobody expected to see win Fenton Kirkland, a child of three years.
Not yet in school and just a few months after his debut, the toddler and her Shetland pony Toffee trotted over three rounds with ease and won the first prize, leaving behind 30 other competitors adults.
Two inseparable - which are the same size - have been recognized for the presentation, attitude and style in the annual competition which was held at Sunnybank equestrian center, Rudry near Cardiff.
Posing against men and women in bowler hats elegant, he wore his hat a little on the flat side so casual to scroll her pony Toffee 2 years old around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for its natural qualities of unusual training for a child his age.
Toffee and received high marks for its presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great duo. "
They introduced themselves against all but two have won the gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were overjoyed that he won.
On the track, people who did not know him thought he was phenomenal if they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, south Wales, following in the footsteps of her aunt Sharon Howells, who participates in equestrian competitions for over 10 years.
Mrs Howells said: "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded. "
He traveled the length of the current track and although he appeared to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy animals - he loves horses, tractors and rural areas and two chickens in their care.
How it began, it surely will soon participate in the demonstration of Horse of the Year - and I'm sure it will make a nice performance.
A spokesman of the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton was only 3 years old, but he knows how to ride her pony. "
They are a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee had well and how they marched on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and trainer - Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure its fine clothes helped Fenton, he really looks great.
The Defence Minister, Rob Nicholson, has insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Forces, and stressed that the transition process was followed by all the soldiers before they return to civilian life .
Attacked by the Liberals and the New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured before their release, members of the army followed a transition plan in collaboration with their supervisors.
All the wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released before being ready Has he said.
Critics accuse the government of trying to save money by not allowing wounded soldiers - which do not meet the rule of "universal service" army requiring staff to be able to make a series of varied tasks - to reach the qualifying period 10 years required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, syndrome of post-traumatic stress disorder, was discharged from the army despite his request to stay one more year in order to receive a fully indexed pension.
His case came after the Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out until you are ready because it did not meet the rule of universality service.
Mr. Hawkins noted that a soldier could be prepared from, with plans and consultation sessions, but it was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I was not ready," said he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major combat in Afghanistan, the military had trouble determining what latitude it may grant the wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks, but are not able to fight.
Under current rules, seriously injured soldiers to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year in Parliament show that among 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service for retirement benefits.
The Liberal critic for veterans, Jim Karygiannis, on Wednesday urged the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins, while the NDP Jack Harris demanded an immediate end to "this shameful practice."
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of ground-to-air short range missiles SA-8 was targeted and destroyed.
This new raid aviation IDF Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances almost identical to that which took place on July 5 at the time, it is also an anonymous U.S. official confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, aimed this time ground-sea missiles Yakhont, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials did not hide their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing Assad to respond.
Life imprisonment for former Chinese Vice-Governor
A former vice-governor of Jilin Province in northeast China, was sentenced Friday to life in prison for corruption.
Expelled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having received more than 19 million yuan of bribes, kickbacks, official Chinese media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also president of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, has helped companies and officials to obtain contracts, loans or discounts in exchange for money or gifts, said first Beijing Intermediate Court on his microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office in March, has made ‚Äã‚Äãthe fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the Head of State promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" with the "flies" - junior staff - only a handful of senior officials were convicted, including former executives of oil giant PetroChina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former head of the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after referred to the highest office in the state.
But the government has shown no intention to reform the fight against corruption for example by creating an independent party.
Bombardier profit down, while deliveries and aircraft orders recede
Bombardier Inc., Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday under pressure from a drop in orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual issues in his division Trains .
Bombardier, based in Montreal, did not provide data for test flight for its new CSeries aircraft or any information as to whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious schedule of commercial operation before September.
After the inaugural flight of the test there about a month and a half flight, it has flown three times, and the question then arose whether the test phase was on track .
The results were not up to the expectations and the share price fell by 8% to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, Thursday lowered its rating from "outperform" to "performance area" due to the low potential upside of the stock market in the next quarter or the next two quarters.
"While the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed with the margin in the Transportation Division," said Cameron Doerksen in a note to clients.
We believe that Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as and when the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new order is announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will catapult into the lower one today dominated by Boeing and Airbus market segment.
The first test flight was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for the CSeries aircraft is modest so far up to 177. It seems that potential buyers waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the claims of the company on energy efficiency and the savings potential of the new airliner.
At present, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and CEO, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders prior to the commercial operation of the first plane.
The leaders also assured analysts and media on Thursday indicating that the program progressed according to schedule.
"The test flight did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin during a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates were provided during the time stop the aircraft.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to first flight and provide a period of updating, and that is what we did.
That recur throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft should fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly after, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer to fly a plane CSeries only 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was currently evaluating the timing of entry into service and provide new information in the coming months.
"This slow flight tests - although apparently consistent with internal calendar Bombardier - reinforces our view that the entry into service will be delayed until the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, net income Bombardier dropped to $ 147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $ 172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues fell slightly from 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and revenue of $ 4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.

Kenyan press unworthy of the controversial media law
"It's a scary country and it is legitimate to ask the question: what prevents Parliament sweeping the independence of the judiciary tomorrow? "Said the newspaper disputing the bill and asking it to be unconstitutional.
"This law is very harsh and punitive, and we refuse," said Cyrus Kamau, General Manager of Capital Group - owner CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and Internet news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and that the restrictions on the content and advertising would harm instead of Kenya into the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and send it to parliamentarians," said he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "control over the media." The Standard, meanwhile, noted that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a blow" and blasted the bill calling it "draconian".
The adoption of the bill comes along with a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by gunmen in the Westgate shopping center last September Islamists.
Kenyan media has angered authorities by broadcasting images of CCTV cameras on which the troops deployed to the scene of the attack allegedly hid the luxury shopping center.

A Aubervilliers capita Launches Party suburbs
Let us not deceive ourselves especially.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party in the suburbs" is not directed only to commuters.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I talk about the suburbs, I address those who are excluded from the great national family.
Nonetheless, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his native commune of Aubervilliers, is born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, the great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all neighborhoods.
My suggestion # 1 is to create a department of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, territorial attached, are now claiming as "100% apolitical" even if it has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 with Jean-Pierre CHEVENEMENT, he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values ‚Äã‚Äãof equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left but if the right people are willing to support me, I listen too, he says.
There are only extremist parties that I do not speak.
Furthermore multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune built his program available on the Internet-from many themes supposed to talk to the residents of the suburbs and in particular to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, civil majority 16 years, rehabilitation function caretaker ...
Remains to find candidates to form lists and defend their ideas in the political arena. "For municipal elections in 2014, it may be fair, he admits."
This is a problem of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my application and I hope other cities.
Abdel-Malik assures Djermoune already have seven heads list in France and Martinique.
"And the messages of support that I received yesterday did not come all commuter" he enthuses.

"The sensational statements on" foreigners returning to the end of the line "and" jobs for Australians first "is an unpleasant return to the days where unions demanded a market protected work," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of whites should be protected - and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The paper reported on 12 measures that had previously been considered by the former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
The Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are under consideration.
If the criterion of "authenticity" was adopted, a visa applicant may be controlled to "whether the job offer is genuine if the candidate is a relationship or a personal associate of the owner or the person within the company that sponsors ".
Companies could also be required to report the number of holders of 457 visas after some of them, having had the intention to sponsor a small number of workers have actually employed hundreds.

The admission privilege is the right of a physician, by virtue of its status as a member of a nursing hospital to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical center in order to provide the diagnosis or treatment.
Abortion advocates argue that the content of the law may result in immediate closure of a third clinical state because these clinics have not managed to get this "admitting privileges" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be nearly 22,000 women who are deprived of access to these facilities.

It recites pornographic drama, into eight chapters that will be released in two parts (1 and 8 January 2014), erotic memories of forty addicted to sex since her teens.
Likeness of Stacy Martin with his eldest is striking silhouette twig, a sheer foundation and Anglo-French origins.
Not to mention a taste of risk: one that did not hesitate to pose nude on glossy paper will appear in more sulphurous situations on the big screen.
An extract of a Nymphomaniac raises the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears there in bed and ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker has asked his players to put their modesty in the closet, he had recourse to professional porn scenes for the most daring sex before merging all digitally body: above the waist, c is the star, below the liner.
Bj√∂rk Charlotte Gainsbourg, through Nicole Kidman, Lars pushing his actors to their limits, always for the better von Trier's practice.
Stacy Martin has not finished talking to her.
There five years ago my father was erased from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking to him now,
I was so afraid to forget or rather I do not know how I would continue to "attend".
There is no recipe for instructions to pass the invisible wall and reunited with his family.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was very hard felt his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening at night to look at his watch that never left me, lying on the nightstand.
It is the image of my smiling that accompanies me in my everyday gestures father.
Our mother passed away after his grueling fight against cancer.
This is at least what I thought the day I found her empty body contorted on the hospital bed with rumpled sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was a frosty farewell focused around lean candlelight framing her coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, by small diurnal or nocturnal apparitions, a little shy, a little erased it quickly back into my mind, evolving gradually as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thought which believed in mourning .
And then she showed me while revealing my own aspects that I had not yet seen, hidden by my relationship with her.
So I learned and realized that I had no person lost my mother but simply a woman I did not really know a woman who embodied this person during his stay in life.
Dying, this woman had the perfect life and paid the person I loved, and now I found her, full.
This detour from the path of my life is the most unexpected and most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that people loved never leave us.
I look like my father, "at home and abroad" seems.
We have always told me.
I've never thought at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he becomes old, sick.
There I no longer afraid of him and I could love.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me when I stopped smoking when I was scared when I was wrong ...
He spoke constantly encouraged me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands watching mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never intrusive.
I could have a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I do not know who said that the deceased are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer but I constantly feel close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life made ‚Äã‚Äãme feel their presence because I always refer: what would they say? what would they think? what would they do?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week for sure.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only, there is always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes some dreams lead me instead and fit in my story and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I woke up, I hoisted out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he smiled at me and was glad that I wait a little boy.
The next day I had the feeling he had visited me in my sleep to signify joy he shared with me what happened to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I take pleasure in telling this common memory lived after his death.
There are precisely five, my grandmother died as the result of cancer.
A year ago she was traveling with my family in Cuba.
This means that the shock caused his death in young bachelor I was at the time.
Anyway I realized my grief rather quickly.
But she continues to influence my life, especially in times when I am in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learn Arabic and became interested in the Middle East, to the point of making a master in high school, were not, in retrospect, innocuous choice.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
Values ‚Äã‚Äãshe instilled in me are always present, so that I sometimes think about how she wants me to act at any given time.
It's the same for my attitudes: I try to be up to the generosity and righteousness of mind which was a fervent believer.
Now I feel like a daily presence, a caring soul, a saving mind.
I see his eyes landed on me.
My mother died there nineteen years now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I went through all the phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, crying that trigger alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous times.
Then, time has soothed the pain.
Remained only the missing empty unanswered, this need her to give me, to reassure me in the palm of its sweetness.
Yet it is there, silent presence, it's there and looks at me.
Every morning I see her worried eyes ask me, I see the dark circles that increase her eyes, fine lines around the lips dig cigarettes, forehead creases that mark the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in the mirror.
And every morning, I looked away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at age 43.
One feels permanently protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile and say his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I speak to him in the hollow of the night when the absence hurts too much, she calls in my dreams when morale is somewhat achieved.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the passage of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to stay on the path that we had drawn.
If you liked to be very strong, no you can not tear the heart and memories.
Somehow, the beloved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father 22 August 2008 as a result of an asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I have always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I did not attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a baby boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with its vision.
I also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I can not sleep and I always wonder what he thinks.
I do not know if I adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him, is it genetic?
In any event, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to us.
In short, it is there everyday.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
That almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years.
The immense pain which then invaded me was attenuated but of course it is always near me.
Very often he "landed" in my dreams so precisely, so alive that I am waking more sad that it was only a dream.
The other night he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, he answer me "I go down" but a voice so real that I woke up with a start, anxious and I turned the bedside looking everywhere, convinced that would happen.
I still live in the same house, and often I feel watching me and I turn to see if it is not there, I know it's him and talk to him.
In every room I can feel it and it makes me happy.
Nothing in the world I would not leave the house where we were happy and or spirit lives with me.
I'm 58, I've always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to say that I am sociable with a business liability, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.

This territory is 47 km2, there are three other small islands around.
It is British since its occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutineers, episode in the history of the British Navy which resulted in three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen people, mostly descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty, Pitcairn still live and their income depends 95% on the generosity of London.
The Island Council has voted unanimously in favor of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, 836,000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this claim.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for the island.

"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as stated in the conclusions of the sheriff.
"They think it defies logic, the laws of physics and common sense," said Crump.

However, a second autopsy has identified another cause of death, according to Moore.

The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
M√ºller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without anyone ever tracked him down, was actually buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
M√ºller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," said he assured the mass-circulation daily based on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, respond to one of the great enigmas of Postwar.
The German secret service, the BND, assured and during the summer of 1949, M√ºller was in Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia then, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service is totally wrong.
"In August 1945, M√ºller body was found in a makeshift grave near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Reich by a commando," says Tuchel.
He wore "a general's uniform."
"In the inner left pocket were notably his service with a photo," he says.
Bild also publishes a document Borough Hall district of Mitte in Berlin stating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the area.
President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by this revelation.
One of the most brutal sadistic Nazis to be buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste.
"We grossly tramples the victims", he has rebelled in the newspaper.
Heinrich M√ºller is one of the leading figures of the Third Reich were never caught.
He participated in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, which decided the "final solution" and had under his command including Adolf Eichmann, head of the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, condemned to death and executed in Israel in 1962 .
Egypt calls in the first freely elected president to take the oath
Mohamed Morsi has taken the inaugural oath, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of inauguration as President, becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Mubarak who was ousted 16 months earlier.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected president of the Arab Islamic world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy there 60 years.
He was sworn in before the 18 judges in black dress of the Court in which the building located along the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said Mr. Morsi, an engineer of 60 years formed the United States, from Brothers Muslim fundamentalist group in question for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and severely repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 am local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and departing the presidential pomp Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of the convoy in the busy streets connecting downtown to the south suburbs.
Considered the "spare tire" little charismatic Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown considerably since his victory and his speech Friday in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a National Civil State, constitutional and modern," said Mohamed Morsi, blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges in the room decorated with wood when he was sworn.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural address.
It was officially greeted by a military band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention to you.
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand ..." sung by thousands of people gathered in the auditorium of the university.
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi has a symbolic oath Friday in Tahrir Square, where left the uprising that ended the authoritarian Mubarak regime last year, and vowed to retrieve presidential powers whose military council, which replaced the former ousted president, the dispossessed.
But by agreeing to officially take the oath before the Court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he bowed to the will of the army by showing that the power struggle is not over.
The speech of Mr. Morsi in Tahrir Square was accompanied by populist gestures spectacular.
Aircraft manufacturers are quarreling about the seat width as large orders are involved
The dispute rages between the major aircraft manufacturers about the width of the seats in the economy class on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow which takes place month.
The dispute concerns the width of the proposed long-haul passengers in economy class seats - which are not always the most sought by airlines, but that the allocated space is essential to increase efficiencies in the latest devices presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus has called the aviation industry to develop a standard requiring a seat height of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing states that it should be the airlines decide.
The dispute erupted when the aircraft manufacturers looking to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping to record orders at the event which runs from November 17 to 21.
How seats will be arranged at the rear of the plane - in particular, there he will be 9 or 10 seats front - is essential for the economic performance of the segment "mini-jumbo".
Boeing says that its "777X" refurbished economy class will accommodate 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says that the concurrent version of the A350 will carry 350 economy class seats in 18 inches wide configured in rows 9.
The aerospace giants often trade blows on technical issues by advertising in the trade press.
Today, Airbus appeal directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X should take precedence over its competitors with over 100 commands.
It has been realized recently that could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the financial presentation of a photo showing three people against each other in the restaurant titled "Do you accept that? ".
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in closer in regional turboprop aircraft seats," said John Leahy, Airbus commercial director.
Such as dietary habits change, people grow, but the seats in airplanes have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined the modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from U.S. Department of Health.
The waistline of the average American twenty-first century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus said that his rival clings to a seat concept which dates from the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly baptized device "jet set" was closer.
Airbus says it has commissioned a study that indicates that extra inch at the seat width improve the sleep quality of 53%.
Boeing Airbus dispute the figures regarding the width of the seats and says it is not manufacturers to decide how airlines trim fares and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that the experience in the cabin not only depends on the width of the seats.
"This is really to provide flexibility for airlines and allow them to do what they feel they should do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They do not want to be told what will allow them to be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more to have some freedom of movement, but for suppliers is increasingly an issue that could affect results.
Behind the dispute lies a race aircraft orders for an estimated amount of at least $ 700 billion in market prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seating configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices.
Boeing and Airbus both claim a seat performance in their latest models engined long-haul 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER 365 seats.
The performances by Boeing depend in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and 777 original model configured in rows of nine.
The gain in terms of unit cost is low compared to the configured with 10 seats per row unit currently in service.
"Boeing did this in order to cram more seats and make its reports more competitive aircraft by our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Passenger Comfort in the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins are configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favor of a more dense configuration, which can go with the cheapest rates.
"A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of 777," said the expert in cabin interiors Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers including airlines must choose.
The sellers who had traveled the world with them outweigh even a meter to test competing configurations.
While touting offer comfortable units, all manufacturers also offer aircraft configurations with high density to low-cost airlines and regional trips.
Airbus A350 offers configured with 10 seats per row but says he has not sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater customization booths offering went on some of its aircraft wider seats side.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern appliances, experts say it is unlikely that his call for the aviation industry to develop a standard size for the lead seats, but could forget the sell of 777X.
The adaptation of the novel by William Nicloux Denis Diderot boasts an outstanding art direction and careful recovery period, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of Mother Superior deliberately sadistic and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pays in lust or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
Conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
The musical, this showman
Classic, sophisticated, popular, English or French, sung and danced productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds his voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical itself as a successful genre.
Long, Notre Dame de Paris Mozart rock opera, most attempts entangled in ridicule.
And successes as Cabaret and Les Miserables wore the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin Chatelet and Stage Entertainment Mogador has changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes handle titles like tubes success.
The first shows this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and the following ad for the world premiere of "An American in Paris."
At Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could be a successful season.
On the other scenes, musical shows like "1789", "Lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals like "Disco" or "Life and Times" are attuned to the success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Stories musicals" and lecturer at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard won.
How are the French musicals?
The offer is multiplied.
First there was the "musicals" that evolve with the producers ...
Some use beautiful projected images and real history as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a leap of fifteen years ago under the pretext that can be used for almost anything when it was Matt Pokora headlining.
After it was musicals with lavish productions du Ch√¢telet that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the world of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularized Anglo-Saxon variety of musical adaptations French.
Independent French producers try a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects as "Rent," "Kiss of the Spider Woman" or "The Awakening of Spring" are struggling to be funded.
We have enough artists capable as Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical performances in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn from project to project.
In the United States, the birthplace of the musical, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these trades in many schools.
Jobs are among many regional theaters, tours, Broadway, the off-Broadway ...
The talent pool is therefore the number of vacancies.
Why provincial tours have they so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor relation of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and is often boulevard theater for adults and not young adults.
Musical performances fill this-lack.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars ...
Propose handsome young men (often talented) headlining a musical, it is the insurance of a craze these girls and often their entire family.
Facebook pages of these shows are expertly run by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a Zenith province.
Mayonnaise is mounted Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to fit in all the great halls of France in the same form as in Paris.

Ben Greenman¬†: Dixi√®me anniversaire du New¬†York Comedy Festival¬†: The New Yorker
One could say that the city of New York is the birth place of the stand-up in America there is almost 100 years, the actor Frank Fay vaudeville, who held the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes in front of the audience, the tone of the conversation.
Innovation Fay has continued over the years, to be taken more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the club stand-up Carolinas, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 performances in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of the headliners have emerged Carolinas, and have enjoyed great success, until they become too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to continue to work with them.
The event this year will be attended by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", an evening of comedy and music to benefit veterans, held at Madison Square Garden, which will present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, as the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in the festival this year have gone through non-traditional channels, presenting such shows on small television, as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has appeared on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of fantasy football cheerfully lascivious the FXX chain) and now has his own show on Comedy Central skits.
Jenny Slate was in the show "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the cast of "Parks and Recreation" series, but yet it is best known for his series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Kroll and Slate, and other young actors in the singular voice (the surrealist Anthony Jeselnik pessimistic, ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main factors of attraction of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg chatting with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became a film director and television made‚Äã‚Äã, as well as unofficial historian of comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land named "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."
The appointment takes place at the Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in DNA comic all the work of Larry," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes down an alley between two buildings and said Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between U.S. and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rails, was discovered.
U.S. officials have described the tunnel 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel zigzagging over a length equivalent to nearly six football fields long, connects warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area is full of nondescript warehouses, which can easily conceal trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs are not going unnoticed emerged, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers exploit vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the greatest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana crop in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels who must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage about 700 yards with railways which started from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went to two warehouses in San Diego.
Syria loses its ability to produce chemical weapons, says watchdog
Syria destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with toxic gas, said the international body monitoring chemical weapons on Thursday as heavy fighting raged in the north, near of sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country there are nearly 3 years.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day ahead of the deadline
November 1, determined by the organization based in The Hague ordering Damascus to destroy or "render useless" all units of production of chemical weapons and machines for mixing the toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy chemical weapons to Damascus by mid-2014.
With the destruction of facilities, Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must start the destruction of weapons and existing stocks again.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of products and chemical weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve agent.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira which, according to experts, contains a chemical production plant and storage sites weapons, reported the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights based in Great Britain.
The militant group, which follows the evolution of the human through a network of activists based in Syria report, said Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, an estimated 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bashar al-Assad died, including 18,678 combatants were pro-government forces and 187 militants Hezbollah.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people died in the conflict since March 2011.
She has not updated that figure since.
Some 2 million people have fled the country due to the conflict.
Troops fighting al-Assad against the rebels, many of which are linked to groups of Al-Qaeda network, Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that there were casualties on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting underlined the importance of the dangers faced by inspectors of chemical weapons when they need to complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal amid a protracted civil war, in time tight.
A statement by the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, stated that his team was "pleased to have now checked - and since destroyed - all reported critical production machines for blending and filling."
She added that "no other inspection activity was not planned at this time."
Earlier in the week, the inspectors said they had completed the first phase of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were not able to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, said the inspectors.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, in Syria, "... and abandoned the program elements they contained chemical weapons had been moved to other sites reported that were inspected ".
It was hard to tell at first glance if the unit Safira was one of two sites that the OPCW inspectors have not visited.
Syria submitted a plan of total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the Executive Committee of the OPCW.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all shown under the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the director general of the organization Ahmet √úz√ºmc√º in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year civil war between the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there was a loud explosion Wednesday in an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, has he added.
Two YMCA staff charged with sexual assault following allegations made ‚Äã‚Äãagainst Jonathan Lord, at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA of New South Wales have been accused of sexual assault against children following allegations made ‚Äã‚Äãagainst educator Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Commission Royal charge of sexual abuse of children.
But in his opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said he "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual abuse of children within its organization."
The Chief Phillip Hare was asked about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with offenses relating to child pornography and a physical education instructor YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare said Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, he was aware of the first case but he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the opening statement was inaccurate YMCA emphasizing "YMCA external controls were performed and indicated that children's safety was a top priority for the organization. "
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA was informed that he had received the second worst assessments of four institutions in a quality Department of Education and Communities conducted in August this year audit.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21 years, admitted that personnel management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he failed to ensure that employees know they were required to report any violation of the security policy for children.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to 6 years minimum jail.
But Mr. Hare has rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing employees to report breaches of the Lord to children's safety.
Staff testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, he kept private, made them sit on his lap, told them he loved them and left playing with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, which was framed by Lord and had requested training in child protection because it was concerned about his behavior, said it was responsible for the child care YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, which framed Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected the testimony of staff according to which they were reluctant to report such violations to their supervisor.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord blurred their judgment, so they have not reported his actions.
Mr. Hare said he had expressed his views to the board of the YMCA of New South Wales stating that, for the organization, the lesson of the "incident Jonathan Lord" should not affect "the reporting "by the staff and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign staff confidentiality agreements, shortly after allegations were raised, was taken by the CEO of the YMCA responsible for childcare, Liam Whitley.
He said that the decision was intended to avoid contamination of evidence, but it was an "excess of zeal" and had been poorly implemented.
YMCA of New South Wales was not safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert in sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He said there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
A ceremony in memory of the deceased cr√©matis√©s
Pere Lachaise crematorium organizes, 11 hours a secular ceremony in memory of all the deceased cr√©matis√©s in its establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, Socialist candidate for mayor of Paris must attend, and then explained at a press conference its proposals for funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funeral, more and more French people choose cremation rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos survey conducted on 6 and 7 September 1009 with people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a close, the opposite is true: the French prefer burial (53% against 47%).
If they have the misfortune to lose a child, they are only 15% choosing cremation.
In his book The Death ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and Vice-President of the National Ethics Committee of the funeral, insists on the "violence" that is cremation for survivors.
There, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body," which will be "reduced to ashes" in a very short time, not after a process of decomposition, which "accompany stages of grief" .
There are also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "erasure of individuality and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ash.
Why what is accepted without penalty in certain Nordic countries and Protestants, is it still not lived in France?
"Because cremation is new," replied Marie-Fr√©d√©rique Bacque, President of the Society of thanatology and author of Taming death.
It is tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame.
Taming cremation is to N√©rard-Fran√ßois Michaud, CEO of Funeral Services of the City of Paris, provide a ceremony for the deceased as worthy as that to which he would be entitled to a burial.
The annual Ipsos shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French want one for their loved ones, whether religious (53%) or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of those choosing cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists and non-believers want too.
Crematoriums have adapted to this changing society.
"For ten years, they try to avoid the violence of families waiting, doing nothing, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the delivery of the ashes," says Mr. Michaud-N√©rard.
70% of schools now offer masters of ceremonies, who shall, in the presence of the body, the following ritual: the welcome meeting appoint the deceased, connect with others, discuss, give meaning to his death, organize the farewell.
This is the case at P√®re Lachaise crematorium, since 1998.
The masters of ceremony are often people who have converted.
There is also a former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Pere Lachaise crematorium organized since 2010 day Saints, many remembrance ceremonies, secular and non-religious, to which he invited the families of those who were cr√©matis√©es year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is enligne sent to the attention of those who could not make the trip.

Hagel criticizes 9 ‚Äã‚ÄãU.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal government has recognized gay marriage, "all military spouses are entitled to an ID card from the Department of Defence and the benefits that come with it," said Minister in New York in a speech to Anti-Defamation League to fight against anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex couples in the facilities of the National Guard" located on their territory, he has denounced, blaming these states violate federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, they can not benefit from many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The defense secretary said he ordered the chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The sling of the nine states began with the Texas refuses to implement these services on the locations of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between Texas law and federal law on gay marriage.
He was joined in his refusal Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of gay marriage in about 5600 active people, 17,000 by including the National Guard, Reserve and retirees.
The price of oil continues to decline and approaching $ 96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall Friday as concerns the importance of stocks offset a report showing that Chinese manufacturing intensive electricity is being strengthened.
The price of U.S. benchmark crude for December delivery fell 14 cents to $ 96.24 a barrel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents Thursday, leaving him with a decrease of 5.8% for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on Chinese manufacturing arrived on Friday, which show an increase in activity, suggesting an increase in demand.
This suggests that the economic recovery in China could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, following a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, an international benchmark for crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $ 108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, which presents its two new Dance Dance group choreographies: first inspired inks and poems by Henri Michaux, the second blown by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism Chouinard, art tics and ink black and white.
A white screen is wall background.
On the carpet, as white in the vast space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advances in profile as a line end and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, ink Henri Michaux is projected.
Body, single line, takes its form.
And this form will be that of the whole piece: a succession of physical imitations of drawings.
The dancers, dressed entirely in black, only the hands and face uncovered, waiting on each side of the playground, rush when the next script appears, embody, emerge running.
This black and white game Henri Michaux is relay solo, group in unison (a mass that is solo), a large group of twelve solos where each performs its sign.
We think "Morning Glory", where solo Chouinard conducting a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, posed online the forefront.
This is the same principle, giant version of PowerPoint.
Here, the music is loud, drums and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the ever faster pace.
There will break when Carol Prieur took refuge under the dance floor, to deliver, microphone in hand, without moderation or restraint, part of the poem Michaux, monotone and monotonous in the auction, and continue dancing.
And music start and the sequence again.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, eventually mute and numb.
As does the regularity of visual rhythm.
There are some nice flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like the hair that these black ruffle or tissue that extend the lines.
But the lack of choreographic composition approach.
One has the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has become, with its tics.
Result: the body appear flat in front of the drawings.
Inks Michaux, as forms of Gestalt, open wider and gamey as dance, more porous imagination.
Only the end, negative, with her dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theater, the magic key.
The audience loved the welcome was warm.
Gymnop√©dies, after intermission, is richer.
The scene is partly draped gray, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics such as furniture in an abandoned house.
Piano, dancers take turns to play the partitions.
Their blunders in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, pass couples, love duets, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small solos transitions, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
Jesters appear as familiar Chouinard, wearing red noses, in love parades highly polarized gender.
Loves are carnivorous, leaking or players.
Gestures, laughter and squeaks transpose beautifully archaic, grace and ridiculous body coitus, beings who are based.
But the play takes off after the real salvation.
A clown comes on stage when the audience leaves.
Here, everything is allowed: the fourth wall falls, the universe explored overlap, dancers cabotinent descend among the spectators glosent, smoke is short, play codes applause, stretch the sauce in a mess cleverly calculated that rest sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and this is the art of Chouinard, then contaminate the public.

Report: Obama campaign considered dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors of President Barack Obama envisioned in the greatest secrecy, to replace Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event that appears in the highly anticipated book of 2012 campaign Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and told Thursday that close associates of the President had conducted "extensive work in groups and surveys in late 2011" to see if the foreclosure could help Obama Biden for his re-election when his hopes were dwindling.
According to the policy Times correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of officials of the campaign and the White House, namely the former general secretary of the White House, Bill Daley, to measure what effect replacement of the vice president by the former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been closely guarded in the campaign headquarters in Chicago and inside the Oval Office.
Only a half-dozen close advisers of the President - including Daley, the former campaign manager Jim Messina Obama and former advisers to the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationship" before finally deciding against change when figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not improve significantly the chances of success of Obama. "
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I said that I considered a range of issues, and this was one of them," said Daley newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we said, "Lord, what can we do? ".
While Daley described the review as "concerted" Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that's reelection campaign had invested heavily to find out if the change would be beneficial at the polls.
"The campaigns do not spend a lot of money in surveys and focus groups unless they are seriously considering taking action," said Martin on AC360.
However, we do not know if Obama knew that his team examined the replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of the potential redesign.
Although Daley has said he did not think that the president "was aware" of any change, the former general secretary admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added, "Double Down" did not answer definitively the question of whether political polls arrived on Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that the eviction Biden presidential list was examined.
"Maybe," replied Martin.
David Bowie: four unpublished listening
The British musician has not finished surprising this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he concocted a deluxe reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unreleased.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new album of David Bowie had left everyone speechless.
The day of his 66th birthday, Jan. 8, 2013, he said that a new album would come out in March.
After ten years of silence (the last album, Reality, dated 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still count on him to make the glitter pop scene.
A feast for fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie was more than one trick up his sleeve with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has plans to reissue this album on 4 November.
For the occasion, he has concocted a real treat for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be in the form of three discs: the original album, studio sessions and unreleased remixes and a DVD containing the four clips already disclosed.
The Next Day Extra contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe Edition, unveiled five songs specially for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie has also made ‚Äã‚Äãpresentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduced both each disk, but also the accessories supplied with: exclusive photos and folders, a notebook to share their own thoughts, a booklet with lyrics ...
And most importantly, it gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars and a very prominent rock expertly controlled power.
Unpublished already listening
Atomica but is not the only way to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a light ride that slows gradually giving way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, Bowie he wanted to make a small reference to Rocket Man Elton John, and even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he is no longer grounded.
Space Oddity, next was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie made ‚Äã‚Äãa new reference both its strangeness: would he from another planet?
The guitar riffs, seductive, make you want to leave the Earth.
Bowie fun anyway to play the chameleon with these titles: turn informant, a man aboard a rocket, martian potential ...
It conceals and reveals both plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, including his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder therefore that it is a mask by hand in the photograph of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, the brand Louis Vuitton, which embodies the new face.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
A bird hoisted to a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, airlifted after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released in the wild.
We drove up the water rail aboard a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before it is delivered on foot by the Scottish SPCA in the center of Alloa rescue.
The center's director, Colin Seddon said: "This water rail was probably a migratory wintering who came from Northern Europe and was caught in the midst of strong winds in the North Sea. "
It seems that the exhausted bird had managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to provide help. "
Water rail was in good health when he was released.
Cogeco Cable may soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately service Netflix video on demand via their TV in a future that does not seem so distant.
Subsidiary Cogeco said Thursday it was conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly as well as more options interfaces," said President and CEO of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable follows the lead of its competitors, such as Bell, even if the subsidiary Cogeco does not have a specific date in regards to this new platform.
"We must adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Mr. Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that if Netflix could offer some technical details that were not mentioned, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service said to be in talks with some major cable so that its service is available via their platforms.
The p.-d.g. Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its throne speech on Oct. 16.
Ottawa would force providers cable TV and satellite to offer customers the ability to pay for services a la carte.
"It's about two and a half years that we say that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãforcing consumers to buy large packages of channels, it does not work," said Mr. Audet.
However, he hoped that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to some interesting recommendations.
"There will emerge from these discussions a kind of new reference framework for defining our new Canadian cultural policy in regard to television," said CEO Cogeco.
The CRTC is conducting public consultations last week and they should continue with the industry next spring.
Side results, Cogeco has reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 cents a share.
This is a decrease compared to net income of 44.9 million, or 83 cents a share, in the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company said the decline in depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired in 2012 Atlantic Broadband cable company, established in the United States for $ 1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after which failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company has also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a Vancouver-based, for the sum of 526 million Internet provider.
As for income Cogeco, they grew 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
Net income of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 cents per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 cents a share, in the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable's revenues however increased 45% to $ 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the 2013 fiscal year, the number of customers Cogeco Cable is up 5546.
Mr. Audet does not care to see the number of customers fluctuate so.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from one quarter to the other with fierce competition.
Gazprom Alexei Miller said that the pipeline Bulgaria inaugurates a new era of gas
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the director of Gazprom.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline project to the largest European scale," said Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom, in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify export routes from Russia to Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, countries which handles most of Russian gas to Europe, increases the level of risk compared with conventional ways, adds the director.
Miller added that the direct connection to Bulgaria, member of the European Union means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers receive the South Stream gas at a discounted rate when the whole project will be commissioned in 2015.
Gazprom said that construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Gunmen fired on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unknown masked opened fire Friday on a hotel near the pyramids in Cairo, Egypt no casualties as a result of an apparent dispute with licensed employees.
The assailants fled, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Interior, Police General Abdel Latif.

Schools are encouraged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In the context of English literature courses, students will study at least one Shakespeare play, a novel of the nineteenth century, a romantic poem and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diverse reading.
A course combining literature and English language will be deleted.
From 2015, students must pass a GCSE language independent, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English Literature.
The Ministry of Education should publish tomorrow its new English and math programs - raw materials to undergo a radical overhaul.
It will carry out changes in other core subjects next year.
Furthermore, Ofqual, the exams regulator Bureau, will unveil an overhaul of the structure of GCSE, with a new scoring system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was a "broad consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," insisting the fact that the GCSE would be "more challenging, more ambitious and rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and students of Singapore are about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of employment time for math, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the depth of GCSE maths - as well as the greater importance given to subjects in international rankings - presumably encourage schools to provide more hours.
The program will focus more on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
The European elite is ready to do business with Great Britain?
Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to meet the business and define what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we ordered the widest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders globally represent all sizes of companies, sectors and regions of Britain.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies now seeking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries modernize and grow while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcana.
When asked their opinion on specific policy issues - ranging from the regulation of monopolies laws on products - the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key competences should return the hands of Westminster.
The single market has caused widespread discontent, companies say that the cost of the Brussels I Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits that it has to be part of the European trade area - 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro -European, even agree.
Finally, and what is even more telling, our survey of business leaders found that a significant majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives in favor of a treaty change and developing a relationship with EU based on trade and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the corporate world insists a "significant change" that gives power to the UK.
The stakes are high - achieving change the Treaty and represent the best interests of Britain would see a shift of 16% of votes in favor of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: This survey shows that British companies are supporting this plan to renegotiate the terms of the accession of the UK to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favor of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area on the path to closer economic and fiscal union.
Priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses it means putting a new emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach to Brussels .
Beijing involves a Turkmen Islamic movement
"The support behind the scenes in the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in central and western Asia," said the boss of the Chinese security organs to a TV channel in Hong Kong, according to a video posted Thursday evening on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official designates a particular organization after the attack Monday.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighurs of a family of predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, which borders several countries in Central Asia, have precipitated their car loaded with gasoline cans against the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 wounded.
The driver of the car, his wife and mother died in the fire in the car.
The Etim, which states fight for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, has been classified by the UN in 2002 among affiliated with Al-Qaeda organizations.
This movement is often referred to by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its actual influence is questioned by many experts.

Ukraine nears bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered the credit rating Friday from Ukraine, casting doubt on the ability of the former Soviet republic in recession for over a year to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of government debt in the country goes to "B-", sinking into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative outlook, S & P saw at least one in three chance it is lowered again within a year.
"It is less likely that the government's strategy to guarantee, sufficient foreign exchange to meet its external financing needs of high," said the U.S. agency.
The agency notes that the foreign exchange reserves of Ukraine fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of loans taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities have used massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency considers more likely devaluation, which inflate its external debt.
Kiev needs further liquidity to meet its gas imports from Russia, which accuses him of not paying a bill of $ 882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of tension with its Russian neighbor, furious desire Kiev to sign an association agreement with the EU in late November.
It was made public after the publication of official statistics showing that the economy had suffered between July and September its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction.
Its debt, yet relatively small, has exploded in recent years and S & P estimated at 33.5% of GDP, against less than 10% before the crisis of 2008-2009.
The country, budget deficit, calls for months using the International Monetary Fund, which in 2010 had granted a loan of $ 15.3 billion and has released for the moment that 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refused to pay any further installment until the country has not adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including raising gas prices for the population.
Following another unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that "significant external financing needs" were "vulnerability", while noting "signs of economic improvement."
However, the economist Oleksandr Joloud, the Centre for Policy Studies, "we can not expect an improvement in the short term."
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms are undertaken in a pre-election year," the presidential elections scheduled in 2015, notes the expert, told AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S & P also notes the "uncertainty" associated with the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, Brussels conditions for the release of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for the long-term trade, but there could be negative in the short and medium terms related to the reaction of Russia consequences," said S & P, which fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, warned that if the creation of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
Pawnbrokers Singapore benefit middle-class constraints to tighten the belt
In a pawnbroker shopping center Bendemeer Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga file a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay the tuition of his daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $ 3,000 Singapore ($ 2,400) per month as an administrator and that her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she said.
In fact, demand is such in parts of southeast Asia - where household debt increases - that ValueMax, where she completed her transaction, this week became the third company pawn to be introduced the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Pawn jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash - $ 1,300 in Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga - but it's almost as cheap as the unsecured bank loans.
In general, pawnbrokers Singapore levy a just effective annual interest rate of 17%, above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local funding with a branch in the same center business.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage not to require credit checks or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
Consequently, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers as families feel the pressure of the rising cost of living and the indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by lax monetary policy in advanced economies, families in low and middle income are turning to pawnbrokers to fill the gap while their economies are slowing.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the rising household debt, primarily due to the increase in mortgage loans as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the household debt / highest Asian gross domestic product ratio.
Malaysia tops the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high consumer debt levels in Thailand, which was released this week little technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The result is that with rising costs, people in the middle or at the bottom [of the wage scale] looking to supplement their income as they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the last two years that people were quick to pawn their belongings to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the articles pledged in 200 pawn shops of the city-state are gold.
People say, "the price of gold is high, say pledge gold chain grandma and come back to fetch the next month."
In Thailand, the largest operator of pawn shops, EasyMoney, recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The increase is such in the pawnbroking industry that ValueMax operator of the store to Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia - where it already has four stores - but also outside of Asia, said Yeah Lee Ching, the Executive Director.
The company will fund using 60% of the $ 66 million it raised in Singapore this week during his introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have reduced rates faced criticism for exorbitant interest rates they charge, Miss Yeah indicates that the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also that it n do not directly increase the debt.
"Customers mortgage assets they already have, and the fact monetize their personal property does not increase in household debt," she said.
Pledging is better accepted socially as a means to get a secured short-term financing.
People who go to pawnbrokers are not only those who have financial problems.
The wealthy Singapore also go into pawn shops ValueMax to pledge gold bullion or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of the cash purchase price.
We see clients from all walks of society.
"It can be wealthy people who need to borrow short-term business activities or investments, or small businesses who needs cash through a difficult period," adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
The lawyer informed that cocaine a drug sponsor a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction is brought to light
He was sentenced to a term of three years' imprisonment by the Assize Court Liverpool
A great defense lawyer, who informed a sponsor of a major drug investigation police because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction is revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough concerning its investigations related to drug trafficking after he compromised because of his habit of cocaine activities.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals as a "very important issue", was arrested at his home in 2011 after listening operations of the police led to Scarborough, he was shown in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, giving evidence three bags of cocaine at the home of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a dinner with colleagues Bar.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of the class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.
On an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought illicitly information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were being monitored at the time by the police in connection with a major investigation of a heroin and cocaine occurring in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine for a total of ¬£ 1.5 million, and more than ¬£ 200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals because he feared that his addiction is brought to light.
Today, in the Assize Court Liverpool, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Solicitors law firm located in Blackburn, fell into disgrace after being convicted on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The fall of the lawyer came after police investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted arriving at the home of Ditta and placing drugs, 60% pure, in the dustbin of lawyer in a black golf glove.
Shortly after filing, Scarborough has been in regular telephone contact with Ditta was a dinner at the football stadium Ewood Park, pregnant club Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug and they phoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests showed traces of the class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine. He said he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all captured and collected a sample of her hair.
During interrogation, he said he had an office in his home, as well as his workplace and that sometimes customers call home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he called the major players in the drug trade, some of which he represented, after key arrests and say what investigators were aware.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know that it should not violate the law, it is a criminal lawyer. "
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer lawyer, and having too involved with individual customers.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of these communications will undoubtedly legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.
But it went well beyond the ordinary relationship between a lawyer and client limits.
He has obstructed the police investigation as he could to enable him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr Ditta did not honor his profession, but was dishonored.
It is too close to some customers, particularly Scarborough, and left compromise his independence.
Ditta denied any illegal act and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done immediately. "
But after the hearing, the Superintendent Lee Halstead Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta's past criminal lawyer in criminal himself when it began to get drugs from organizations criminal. "
His addiction to cocaine has never compromised and made vulnerable to ulterior motives leading members of organized criminal groups who charge to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should uphold the highest standards of integrity and build trust with the public.
Mr Ditta has betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
The unit responsible for serious and organized crime in Lancashire led the investigation into Mr Ditta, who was convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstructing justice, demonstrating its commitment prosecute criminals to justice.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals to let them know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and you translate the courts.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to traffic in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On its website, Ditta organized a session of questions / answers about himself in which he said that his dream job would be a lawyer to represent clients in death row in America, his last invited to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.

A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists Centre for Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) de Laval has caused quite a stir in the direction of the Hospital de la Cit√©-de-la-Sant√©, and during 2012 -2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or any short departures, the pharmacy department has been strongly deficient personnel.
He missed nearly 30% of the workforce necessary, making this fiscal year "very difficult", according to head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to engage in independent labor, which can cost up to three times more expensive than a pharmacist hired full-time.
We did not use the troubleshooting said Ms. Beaudet.
Were streamlined or reduced some of our activities within the facility for landing, until things reinserted.
Obviously, we worked hard to attract our young [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.
There is a coincidence that fact that we were in a bad situation last year.
situation improved
After this difficult period, the 2013-2014 year will be much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after maternity leave and three pharmacists were hired in the last month.
In addition, efforts by the department to retain have borne fruit, as four students currently in residence at Laval also decided to remain in the employ of CSSS.
Now it is much better, said the pharmacist.
By the end of the fiscal year, we have seven new pharmacists and three returns motherhood.
So it will fill our departures last year.
Ever-growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospital or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 are difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because it was an environment that is young and employs many young women, so with pregnancy, almost always traveling at three maternity leave when things are going well, a- she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and does not have pharmacists who are available for replacements, so it was more difficult.

Caused by the sentence in anger against one of the Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 have reacted angrily to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be executed by firing squad execution.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run by being one of the most popular Asian southeast men, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosives used during the attacks.
It could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45 year old man was convicted of mass murder for attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and wounded many others.
He was also convicted of numerous other charges related to terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors asked for a sentence of life imprisonment, though they could have asked that the man called "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in bomb-making, be sentenced to death.
The decision has revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost his twin 39 years, Jane and Jenny in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and other conspirators there nearly 10 years.
In tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think it should have followed the same path as other men.
"It should be dragged before a firing squad," said Mrs. Corteen PAA.
I have to live every day without other grandchildren or see my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a massive bomb loaded into a van parked outside, exploded just after 23 pm Oct. 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew them a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He slipped into a coma after the attack and was unconscious for a month, and he "died" three times while he was on life support.
Mr Hughes said Patek should suffer the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell responsible for the carnage Jemaah Islamiyah - Amrozi, Imam Samudra and Mukhlas - who were executed there 4 years.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injured hundreds of others, it is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces kill former leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in order to re-establish links between Asian terrorist groups southeast and Al-Qaeda .
"He did not realize," said Mrs. Corteen.
Until recently, he did not care grief he could cause others.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Ms. Corteen.
Patek may, however, to appeal his conviction.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become prime minister, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.

Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the helm of the country, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and the role of the Quartet Special Envoy for Peace Process Middle East.
When asked if he would return as Prime Minister, Mr Blair would have responded, according to the London Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that this happens, so ..."
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban Movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan Friday, Has it learned from the security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death was announced several times already in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the movement activist said this time he had lost his life in this striking, conducted in the region of North Waziristan.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security.

Mess around closure Emergency H√¥tel-Dieu
Face slingshot conducted for several months by some personal and several unions, including the CGT, the health minister, Marisol Touraine, decided on July 10 to "shift the timing of implementation of the project, and in particular the closing date for emergencies that may occur on November 4. "
Officially made ‚Äã‚Äãa request "to not take any chances on the management of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter" but also was not to interfere with the PS campaign a few months before municipal elections.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Although the AP-HP, it is preferred to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of November 4, firefighters? which provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual ED visits of the Hotel-Dieu? have all been instructed to take the thirty severe cases a day to emergencies other Parisian hospitals.
This November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding.
At the Hotel-Dieu, specialized in internal emergency leave Monday instead of five internal general medicine.
Regarding the transfer of beds of Internal Medicine, it is scheduled for later this month.
"The emergency reception of the Hotel-Dieu service must close in the shortest possible time, and for us it is November 4th," says bluntly Lo√Øc Capron, chairman of the Medical Committee of establishment ( CME) of the APHP, which supports the project management.
"On November 4, there will be more patients brought by firefighters, only people from their own way," says Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we continue to accommodate emergency patients," he tempers, arguing that the permanent presence of vehicles on site SMUR to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain in place, he says also.
But it is the LRA to decide the closure of the emergency department.
"Things are gradually" replied Nicolas Peju, spokesman for the ARS that on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied or was lied to him," laments the emergency physician Gerald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his post as head of SMUR early July for leading the revolt against the proposed reorganization, it is defined as a "whistleblower" against a "cynical" decision "medico-administrative techno".
"They are emptying and suffocate emergencies that have been refurbished there less than five years," he says.
For him, "if other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
Now they are regularly congested.
There are for example some nine hours emergency wait Lariboisi√®re.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" on multiple sites are not likely to represent a "flood" in the other emergency services, including human resources have also been strengthened.
At the ARS as APHP, we defend the "new hospital model" already started since October 7 and which should continue to accommodate 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberals GPs should also come and participate in the establishment of a "permanent outpatient."
"Where will we if we ask people to self-diagnose" asks Gerald Kierzek for whom "the concept of urgency not matter" is "dangerous" and represents a "medical regression".
This will happen as for maternity Level 3.
People are not stupid, they will go where there is the best deal of care.
If the minister does not take any action by Monday, we'll shift gears warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency physician and member of the CGT Health.
We will be more present in the context of the municipal campaign and we think to make a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Roger Vincent, advisor and elected UMP Paris 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Paris UMP was to maintain emergency at the Hotel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen if we go back to responsibility. "
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, has meanwhile reiterated again Monday morning on France Inter that she was in favor of a moratorium so that there is no closure on Nov. 4.
If this were the case, it would mark its net disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Although the restructuring of the H√¥tel-Dieu its legitimacy on the merits, we can not be admitted without an acceptable pattern transfer to other hospitals.

Pope Francis appoint its first cardinal in February
Pope Francis appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The Cardinals are men of the highest-ranking church in the Catholic Church after the Pope and those who elected him, so Fran√ßois appoint its first group of men who eventually choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinal.
However, when a cardinal reached the age of 80, he can not participate in the election of a pope - it therefore amounts to a group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all existing cardinals held before the ceremony during which bishops will be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
"The Pope Francis decided to communicate its decision to convene the consistory of February in advance to facilitate planning other meetings requiring the participation of Cardinals different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will probably decreased.
He said that Pope called in general as cardinals he had for the number of cardinal electors to reach 120 and many older cardinals over the age of 80 he wanted.
The Presbytery of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, said Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals around the world to restore the balance," said he added.
40% Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be selected since Fran√ßois formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to examine ways to reform the church.
Previously, the pope decided alone.
"Now, Fran√ßois chose these eight cardinals they help," said Valero.
He added that it was "quite possible" that Francis asks board to the Cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation - it is totally new.
Valero said that the popes generally amounted bishops represent large communities to the rank of cardinal, but Francis was "full of surprises - so we do not know who he will appoint."

By voting, we send a clear message.

He had spent ten days in Afghanistan, Theatre 198 and 199es installment of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically diminished by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was traveling on this journey with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he was also left in Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, G√©rard de Villiers, born 8 December 1929 in Paris, assured ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS Istanbul", the first of the series, there is almost half a century.
"Probably between 120 and 150 million across all countries," he argued in March.
Burmese cat on his knees in the living room of his huge apartment of a building in the Avenue Foch's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, the mischievous look in his white hair, he quoted some of the languages ‚Äã‚Äãin which SAS adventures have been translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese, or Korean.
"Besides the pirate editions," he added, pointing to a stack of books on the coffee table between bronze or ivory surveyed reported 130 to situate his novels countries.

In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitical and exotic, some scenes of hardcore sex, a touch of violence and torture.
"I have never claimed to be a literary author," explained G√©rard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people I do not send a message.
He worked "as the great reporters prewar type Albert Londres, who went there and came back with real and lengthy investigations."
Father SAS said "make a kind of geopolitical drama."
"I am always my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gerard de Villiers.
There, I met journalists, including AFP, diplomats, people of the services I know some for twenty or thirty years.

In "Les Fous Benghazi," he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret command center of the CIA in this city, the birthplace of the Libyan revolt.

300 pages later, he wrote the word "END" and corrected each page in pen.

Some women are sex objects in my books but others are beautiful women, smart and courageous.
I am always welcomed in Africa where I count very many readers.
G√©rard de Villiers said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, not age."
He will not die and will not go back.
Not more than me.
