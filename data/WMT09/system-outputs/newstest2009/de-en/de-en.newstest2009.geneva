The Prague stock exchange falls against closings time in deficit. 
After the steep waste at tomorrow the Prague stock exchange cannot correct the losses. 
The transactions with the shares from EZ reached almost the half of the normal day business. 
The Prague stock exchange connected at once to beginnings of the Tuesday businesses to the collapse of Monday, when they around large six percent points went down. 
This time the reason found for the collapse at the Wall Street. 
Also in the Czech Republic the reaction of the market on the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives thus appears, the he refused, to support a stabilization plan for the local finance sector. 
Fall of the shares in Asia 
The shares at the stock exchanges in Asia lived at Tuesday a dramatic fall, although the indexes cannot balance a part of the losses during the day. 
The index of the Hang Seng stock exchange in Hongkong almost lost four percent points during the business day, however later on a part the losses wett manufacture, therefore the decline on about 2,5 percent decreased himself. 
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, the the movement of the Chinese shares at the stock exchange in Hongkong watches, went down around 3,8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed. 
The shares at the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, the losses on 4,3 however then decreased percent. 
The stock exchange in Taiwan went down after the local index around 3,6 percent. 
"The timing for the rescue action in the U.S is uncertain and the finance markets influence world-wide", thus who leader the currency authority in Hongkong Joseph Yam. 
Hongkong then independently decides from the central Chinese bank, although he belongs to China, his currency policy of himself,. 
The interest rates in Hongkong move himself level like the on demselben in the U.S. 
The American legislators thus fast and zurückkehren the plan the finance system possible at the negotiation table for a support the Australian primeminister Kevin Rudd verabschieden after words. 
Differently, that am also concerned large countries from the collapse threaten. 
A carnage of American shares 
The American House of Representatives had the plan at Monday for a support of the finance system, for what until were spent dollar( almost 12 billion K) to 700 billion. 
The legislators thus ignored the invitation from President George Bush, who to support plan. 
Bushs view after the plan and therefore help the fundamental causes rules for the financial crisis, to stabilise the total economy. 
The American shares lived a carnage at Monday, and the important share indication the tall collapse in more than 20 years wrote down. 
Jones index went down around almost seven percent, he in the end written down in year of 1987 a similar collapse. 
The index had already been before the vote, despite everything hardly there in contrast brought signs, that durchkommen not got the plan in House of Representatives, the index lived a free fall. 
Congress makes concession: American government can pump 700 billion dollars in the banks 
The supreme representatives of the American congress and the government from President George Bush have come to the agreement on a great form of a treaty over a financial aid for the American system. 
Next above abgestimmt to get beginning week. 
The American legislators reached dollar( about 12 billion crowns) in talks over the adoption of a rescue plan in form of a financial aid for the American system in an extent from 700 billion a breakthrough. 
However this still means no victory. 
The congress deputies must namely still mustn't some details of the convention, before they publish the end version of the law and over dürfen suits. 
The plan to support of the finance system am negotiated at Monday in American congress. 
At Sunday the chairman of the board for banks said this -- and provisions of services Barney Frank the agency of Reuters. 
In senate cannot be suited Wednesday distinct indications in conformity with probably at the earliest at over the plan. 
A communication above, that been the plan, the first important psychological factor shall be for a stimulation of the finance markets economists in conformity with. 
How then it comes however to a" disenchantment" because of of the intricate mechanisms, one cannot also help the markets in the practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We have gotten an important progress. 
We our distinct view it our have, a packet shall looked to stabilization of the market", the democrat Nancy Pelosi opposite told the agency Bloomberg. 
Their word in conformity with it cannot still come at Sunday to a end vote. 
Representatives of the legislators met together American in the night to Sunday with that finance ministers Henry Paulson, around what to lend his final form government back. 
This one a purchase unsaleable Hypothekenaktiva a from the finance societies, who the finance enterprises fling in heavy losses and the stability of the total system gefährden. 
"We and declare at edge of a final agreement about a plan, who will work who also his necessity on the market effective. 
One must still beyond continue the Gesundungsplan, yes I think, we are at goal", according to Paulson. 
A signal for Asia businesses 
The financial global crisis also stuns distinctly himself in the stockmarkets, who to go strongly down. 
The words of the democratic Sen. from Nevada, Harry Reid, in conformity with are who legislator strives, still before Sunday in congress to a final agreement to reach. 
It one namely the investors before businesses on the Asiatic finance markets the, who to be in the first time area, a decision the congress the businesses beeinflussen at Monday. 
When up to now though is still not all clearly, two junk rooms the American congress abstimmen over the law, also confusion rules over, whether the negotiations not thus still fail minute in last at a problem. 
The legislators hope that he is voted in the next days. 
The law though will learn still some changes. 
The affirmative to help for the system total amount shall be divided in two parts. 
The how initial 350 billion dollar shall be thus put quickly on on ready possible, like president George Bush called. 
The congress however cannot the distribution of the remaining money, if he has the impression, that his function not fulfils the programme, and indeed by large 100 billion dollar and later on who final 350 billion dollar. 
Bush evaluates positively progress in negotiations 
The president indeed a veto law by this decision, however the congress can überstimmen his veto. 
In spite of these changes however the grundgedanke of the programme have stayed existences, who, finances bad for the purchase mortgage bonds, who value pleases rested on it is, to get, because hundred thousands are no longer Americans in the situation, to repay their mortgage. 
"We have worked all out. 
The House of Representatives then his the senate in the situation at Monday, at Sunday over the law to vote,", according to the republican Sen. Judd Gregg. 
Satisfied with the progress the American president Bush also proven. 
His spokesman explaining, Bush with the progress of Saturday satisfied and "estimate what to strive beidseitige, to stabilise and to protect our economy our finance market". 
Limitation of gilded parachutes 
The chairman of the bank board of the senate Christopher Dodd, who the legislators had managing negotiators, leak let, of himself on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of the taxpayers before losses, the end from vergünstigungen and a calendar for the financing of the plan comes to the agreement. 
The new law also the rip. to restrict gilded parachutes for directors of the societies, who am participated at programme and a board a, what the supervisor shall devolve over the backs. 
The finance ministry shall manage this one. 
"We had very harshly daran and a tall progress in direction of a convention achieves, who works and important for for the market and for all Americans", according to Paulson. 
The plan also expects with an help for owners, who problems their mortgage with the repayment. 
The government shall negotiate new rates by mortgages, who where she monopolises, the goal consists in inside, to drop and to allow them the monthly expenses he for the debtors, to keep their house. 
Marek: Psychological help 
The proposed plan a good idea, yes who implementation very difficult after the main economist from Patria Finance David Marek. 
"And indeed therefore, because one not knows, who problematic Aktiva be to monopolize. 
That decisive in contrast decisive, mutually the finance sector and the government the losses distribute ", Marek said iHNed.cz the Server to this week. 
Whether the plan now or beginning of next week is voted, view is after Mareks not decisive. 
"Much important there is, that the deputies comes it to the agreement, to support the plan and that she he thus fast how possible do vote. 
Who psychological meaning the convention important above, that it comes to an adoption, that in this time ", Marek stressed. 
Duel on knife edge: MP3-Player against cellular phones. 
We recommend you by your election 
, While each cellular phone MP3-Dateien can almost play no MP3-Player can still telephone. 
From then on he naturally sees according to end that there are good of, himself to buy only a telephone. 
Why despite everything there are sufficiently reasons in contrast, one shall adopt an autonomous player. 
The election all hangs the future from the way of the use and the entitlements properties as of. 
Certainly one buys with difficulty himself for at home a great expensive recordplayer, in order himself it to listen to the new album from Maxim Turbulenc. 
Once it also in contrast appears musical novelties not on LPs, out of qualitative visibility give he no objective reason. 
Have you however LPs with way skirt, you dream probably at least from a such jazz or blues in shelf,. 
So that is also with the music on rice, well, with komprimierter music simplify expressed -- music in MP3-Format. 
Also here there are price-- and quality categories. 
For the someone perhaps not likewise he satisfactory, for a player of 8000 crowns to handle, however a Pink-Floyd-Fan profit with difficulty earpieces for twenty crowns of market supports. 
Two extreme, between who there are sufficiently space for each. 
The choice is gefächert great. 
Also the life duration of the batteries is decisive. 
Some good Music player can much more cannot as only music, however the, to know what cellular phones cellular phones, they delete not even hint way. 
No modern appliance is thus universal to start like the telephone. 
Next to the crucial functions, what and telefonieren that cornices, he can reproduce music and of video, to take both, he once has a good, paint a bad camera and perhaps also cannot. 
, And if one still includes the Smartphons and Kommunikatoren one almost a small computer in the bag. 
There is a small miracle, thus no refrigerator and barbecues no television fotografieren. 
Yes the Universalität of the cellular phones also brings disadvantages with himself. 
Per more functions you on your cellular phone take hold, all the more frequent will mustn't however nachladen you he. 
And the abspielen from music is a the tall Energiefresser. 
Only few cellular phones more than zehn-zwölf to play hours, most of the time he much less know music. 
In this consideration Music players (special the easy) effective distinctly. 
Therefore you shall expect it by the cellular inexpensive phones, that not they long when hours music can play a pair. 
, If you then telephone as of and at still you still buy preferably himself to security for an drawer appliance fürs office-- also passes for expensive appliance. 
By MP3-Playern do not get you this problem who few good stops at least 9 hours non-stop enterprise aufladen with a time out of. 
A large problem then exists, if one likes überspielen the music on cellular phone. 
Unfortunately only a minimal part of the appliances over someone arranges USB-Abschluss, moreover each cellular phone without special software does not look direct at a PC plug in. 
Naturally one knows überspielen directly the music on a memory media, thus only few card readers without reduction ready with the minuscule memory cards, the in cellular phones use development. 
By players you need no special software except exceptions( iPod). 
They need only to feed the appliance over USB-Port with music out of your PC. 
The cellular many phones and of players even put a music library on, tidied after the name of the Interpreten, the title of the album, the gender or of for example the evaluation through users. 
Some appliances only the tree pattern of the address directory the, similar the Windows Explorer, many both( iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephone with operating system). 
Players are easy to serve, cellular phone more know 
Concrete by the choice of someone appliances you himself the in particular after the life duration accumulators, who and naturally also memory capacity, the quality and that type the sound the Bedienkomfort erkundigen. 
Above all and music wing hören you they each day for you only little for example in the tramway, then a cellular indifferent phone offers, the MP3-Dateien play. 
What does really already almost each cellular phone know. 
They must no longer check particular, what a cellular phone or a player can work music formats. 
MP3 succeed all, and the many music, who you get, am just in this format. 
The format belongs to widespread to the at many, and moreover knowhow who most also play appliances music WMA-Format in. 
Fewer customary AAC (a format, the Apple and his use iPods). 
Cellular good phones allow online equally the purchase from music. 
One needs to call the corresponding sides of a supplier( or an other supplier) only over movable internet, and already one knows a song or album acquires. 
Why this provision of services can already in contrast be an irrefutable argument at and for himself, one shall adopt a cellular phone. 
Unfortunately the supplier is badly the offer and most of the time only limits fast radio tubes. 
The prices are no longer the low. 
Generally though one leaves from it for, that in future just now this way the sale the music industry beherrschen from music( there is over GSM, internet or wireless internet). 
The many by himself carry the cellular phone. 
If you have desire of, himself to listen to something, you take the cellular phone in the bag, during who players oversight at home is. 
He arrives however it, whether you also carry always earpieces or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung by himself. 
, Over who almost if you resort not, knowhow to the integrated loudspeaker each cellular phone arranges, however only the few MP3-Player. 
The tall well advantage of the cellular phones will find for a lot in price. 
The inexpensive normally less cost crowns as 3000. 
For three -- and you already get 4000 crowns an all suitable Walkman. 
The tall handicap will be for the many, that no normal earpieces in addition to. 
The good and technical end mature esten telephones with someone of 3,5- mm-Öffnung for normal earpieces crowns cost until to 15000. 
The advantage of the players anew finds in the light service. 
The easy -- and not absolute inexpensive (look at choice)-- everybody can really serve players. 
A minimum at functions, who the recordplayer is early or for example resemblance by the service with that normal cassette taperecorder visibly. 
He then threatens enormous bill for data transmissions of no crash of hiring in form of someone erroneous movable internet and someone. 
What appliance shall one now take 
Also the cellular inexpensive phones( for example Vodafone 527) arrange Slot in the rule over someone for redeemable memory media( type M2, microSD u. ä.). 
Even if nachkaufen you a corresponding card, 2000 pass crowns out of. 
Despite everything respect. 
GB are supported only cards in the rule with a maximal capacity from 2 by the basis models. 
Only the expensive can also read 8-GB-Speicherkarten. 
If will already and still'll you a cellular phone besitzen himself a low-cost MP3-Player, then you take Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
According to capacity( max. 2 GB) must then no longer put on as 1100 crowns on the table. 
Belong you to the demanding earpieces, you take preferably cellular spezialisierte phone-- Walkmans( Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung). out 
These appliances autonomous Bedienknöpfe for MP3, and the Bedienkomfort devolves thus at who heran a single MP3-Players. 
At large Sony Ericsson are here, what cellular phones the same interface out of the series Walkman like the selling single MP3-Player. 
The same services in the same price category from high until to 4000 crowns, but with someone memory capacity( until too 16 GB) and a long accumulator life duration (normally 15 hours, maximal until to 35 hours) MP3-Player carry you out who upstairs so-called makers. 
The first potential supplier already comes in this year after the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The telephony market in the Czech Republic is really mature, the Czech supplier practically offer provision of services to all, as also she offer from their partner in Western Europe. 
All the same something-- a potential supplier, who pressures the classic into low prices. here fails 
Perhaps this one will let no longer long wait for himself. 
That the Czech telephony suppliers work at all to the expensive in Europe, we have already often brought back on Mobil.cz to. 
This moreover also confirmed TÚ, who attentive it to the telecommunications authorities, that the price is here SMS for someone high when the European European Union in rest realised. 
After the last steps he thus devolves probably to a paradoxical situation on the European commission in area regulation of the Roaminggebühren -- for plain customers of the Czech telephony suppliers SMS his as out of the stranger inexpensive at home. 
How does he arrive from, that the prices be thus in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe high? 
The answer is easy, he fails the competition, who really an struggle ansage power. 
Perhaps it ring paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there thus gives three telephony nets and a penetration from far away more than 100%. 
The telephony suppliers curse gladly in contrast above, that he many competition on the Czech market extreme give. 
The the chairman of the council of the Czech telecommunications authorities( TÚ) often also pflichtet ák Pavel Dvo to, by, who had often expressed in the past, that there are no place in the Czech Republic for a large supplier. 
He probably ballots, that no longer have a classic supplier many chances with an own net particular( moreover he also hardly still find frequencies likely). 
There are however still a possibility-- a potential supplier. 
Just now the entry of potential suppliers on the telephony market brought a clear price reduction with himself, on what the classic telephony suppliers mustn't then also react to. 
Such in addition to there still gave before the entry enterprise as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile similar voices on the market in Great Britain in the Czech Republic. 
He have however shown, that there are place for such suppliers and that this one can be successfully real. 
Moreover one does not long after examples to look need. 
In Feb we have reported over the departure of the potential supplier Mobilking in Poland this one. 
In only an half year there succeeded this supplier, more to win and thus fünfgrößten customers suppliers the country as 100 thousand to rise. 
Behind Mobilking the finance group Penta on top of that declares, who in the Czech Republic under other U: own fon. 
The advantage of potential suppliers consists in on top of that inside, that one can concentrate on a much concrete target. 
In order cannot work effective, potential suppliers namely need many few customer as a classic supplier. 
They namely need no relative high expenses for the building, the enterprise. 
In the world the potential suppliers thus normally than Low-Cost-Firmen heraus stand out -- they offer inexpensive telephone talk and of SMS, what however often few bulky provision offer from someone accompanied. 
So Tesco Mobile for example at least offers in Great Britain SMS around the half inexpensive as his competitor. 
, As however the example from Mobilking shows in Poland cannot there also a really good failure train, on a to put on not stereotyped target. 
This supplier namely addresses himself specific at men. 
"Authentic guys elect Mobilking -- who they can and trust supplier, who they please that", according to David Seibert, the CEO from the Mobile entertainment company, the operator enterprise of this potential supplier. 
Difficult to say, how whether foot cannot also take a similar plan in Poland in the Czech Republic. 
daran the press spokesman from Vodafone Miroslav also doubts epický: "The Czech market for a market segment, on who the many potential suppliers rest on, relative small. 
Moreover he is saturated out of the visibility of the provision offer relative. " 
In the Czech Republic the telephony suppliers mean fate, 
However almost sure sure, that, if a potential telephony supplier Czech Republic conquers, this not Mobilking. 
"We indeed say this successful project from an expansion, despite everything in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particular optimistic. 
He gets eher to an market entry from Mobilking in other countries of our area kommen ", so dissociates ková in a telephone talk for Mobil.cz Jana Studni of, press spokesman of the finance group Penta. 
Indirect she thus certified, that not the current telephony suppliers this thought in the Czech Republic particular leant. 
On the contrary 
Her interest at a departure of a potential telephony supplier already shows Novera, who liked like a large step, in order a real competitor enterprise customer from Telefónica O2 in area since long time to the group of GTS. 
"We a tall interest daran, only to offer also provisions of services. 
And per early, all the more improve. 
Over this possibility had we with all Czech telephony suppliers negotiate. 
With some from they we cannot already reach negotiation progresses ", thus who press spokesmen the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps good times now come. 
Out of not official information hervor go, that perhaps to wait the first potential supplier the year until end. 
Up to now though this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of the silence. 
"In this time we do not leave from it for, that place consist in the Czech Republic for a complete potential supplier. 
The Czech market shows tall compared with other markets Spezifika. 
Up to now no subject have still answered us project with a complex and thoughtful in this area", mean e in his explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr out of the press department from Telefónica O2. 
On the Spezifik of the Czech market large suppliers also indicate. 
The press spokesman from T movable Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the explanation from O2: "Up to now we still found no viable and profitable beidseitig project, on what one cannot beyond build." 
And she adds: "In net from T movable a potential supplier will hardly emerge until end of the year. 
In this time we mustn't already have a concrete offer existence, in order cannot thus think in the short run. " 
Vodafone obtains his attention rather on the fulfilment of the requirements of the own 3 G licence. 
Miroslav epický means to it: "For negotiations with potential potential suppliers we open, in particular in area dividing from expenses and of infrastructure. 
We consider out of the visibility of the customers just now this as the good. 
The main strategy from Vodafone in this area finds in the research after a partner to assembly of a dividing net for a fast movable internet. " 
The responsible authorities -- with the suppliers hand in hand 
The process of the telephony suppliers is easy to understand, a large supplier called competition many, this and also became go down prices thereby to a decline of the profits lead. 
Then one a such competitor the market entry erleichtern? 
That can cannot the suppliers at a cord, if there go around something, also long justify hin und her that around the genesis from U: fon. 
The strong well impression in direction TÚ went from, as U: fon on the market went back, T movable from the society out of. 
The public accessible information from the TÚ-Webseiten also justify that. 
Now though just U appropriate: why fon than argument, one shall not admit a potential supplier. 
Martina Kemrová noticed it: "The competition environment of the telephony market recently moreover still a fourth supplier through the entry fortified. 
Under obvious obvious, that a new actor put his provision of services high requirements on on at the market even and above all. " 
Against this herangehensweise of the suppliers absolute lack of interest of the Czech authorities however surprizes that. 
He is on top of that not only a matter around the position of the TÚ, who the competence unfortunately not has-- developed in difference to Great Britain and large anticyclone states-- in Czech, in the economic competition to intervene. 
This one owns exclusively the office to protection of the economic competition( ÚOHS). 
This however reported his all typical position to this total problem. 
"The market entry of a potential telephony supplier were then possible, after and he a potential supplier the necessary infrastructure to an contract end between a telephony supplier over the Anmietung come. 
Up to now no such contract was closed, thus the offer of potential amateurs not probably for the classic suppliers sufficient interesting", thus in his answer to our demand Kristián Chalupa from the department foreign relations of the ÚOHS. 
From representatives of the suppliers someone not surprise such formulation. 
From an authority, who the consumer interests replace and inter alia it to respect, that nobody his position on the market abuses, this is many when dubious. 
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In stranger, potential suppliers all normal to get accustomed, to observe that her market entry have contributed to a price reduction by movable provisions of services." 
Probably though belong the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction not to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
Really shocking is at this fall who almost already touching accord the three telephony suppliers, who results from her reaction. 
The question, whether he is a matter really only around a coincidence, finds on the hand. 
How likewise the same absolutely gas price is certainly only and coincidence the consequence of an hard competition struggle by the service stations. 
"The authority have discovered no signs in this matter, who to indicate a gerichtetes against the competition bargaining, and therefore also they no reason, on someone take in the matter intervene. 
No the suppliers a domineering market position, therefore he does no longer have the corresponding increasing responsibility for his bargaining on the market. 
The regulation authority for telecommunications probably also lacks the necessary instruments for an opening of the telephony market for potential suppliers ", Chalupa led in his explanation. 
The interpretation of the dominate position on the market is a from many controversial points. 
Naturally there are an analysis of the major markets, worked out from the TÚ, after the telecommunications out of the visibility of the economic competition a single market is. 
On a such market then naturally nobody the Czech telephony suppliers a dominate position inne. 
Plain Rechtsexperten however offers an other visibility way-- for the market entry of a potential supplier always the agreement of the net operator is necessarily. 
And the telephony suppliers the monopoly for his net-- wise--. 
Who, that he necessarily takes a dominate position in an affirmative segment mean. 
Himself that if one however not gives up with this argumentation, there shall be at least a warning for the ÚOHS, three telephony suppliers auffallend advance similar. 
On top of that grievances of a line from amateurs( enclosed of the mentioning society of GTS Novera) justify, that they trip by negotiations with all suppliers on very similar obstacles. 
The Abwälzung of the responsibility on the TÚ is then a really customary trick, with who the ÚOHS dissociates matter from the whole in the provisions of services. 
This was already in some similar falls to watch. 
Unfortunately there have not succeeded, in who recently did vote amendment the telecommunications laws the expansion the competences the TÚ the economic competition on the area in who do to impose telecommunications, although a line had promised an improvement the situation from specialists it. 
That mustn't only too well the representatives of the ÚOHS, thus probably they other interests. 
There already go, if nobody looks 
Unnoticed the functioning of none of pseudovirtueller suppliers, from who there are at once several in the Czech telephony nets only once stays. 
He however only partially enterprises, who own price tricks handle movable provisions of services, who public. 
Normally he is namely a matter around enterprises, who to agieren in area Multilevel-Marketing. 
Own movable provisions of services for example offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, to Starlife and others. 
The price tricks of these enterprises normally reach only for Auserwählten. 
The joke of the matter consists in inside, that a tall amount orders the enterprise compared with the operator when classic enterprise customer emerges, who at SIM-Karten. 
As important customer he then gets special price offers( and other offers). 
The problem consists in inside, that the business conditions of all Czech telephony suppliers ban a took similar sale. 
"There shall be falls, who to describe you, then he knows himself around an injury, with who who do contractual conditions bargain we we then development, what took a completion of the cooperation with the corresponding to society occupies", Martina Kemrová replied on our question to this problem. 
However really unlikely unlikely, that the telephony supplier thus a little not leaks by the officials. 
In particular in fall of the three mentioning enterprises he can be a matter around thousand customers. 
No operator opposes to however a such process. 
Out of who namely simultaneous to get not activity these enterprises fliessen they not too neglecting profits they-- in difference to the real potential suppliers-- through the real official marketing compromize. 
On possible problems make epický Miroslav attentive: "The law allows such ways from speculations, in spite of all only the provisions of services these enterprises the customers from a very minimal percentage take hold. 
This one must moreover accept, that the SIM-Karte not runs in her telephone on her name, she then not the telephony suppliers complete above have at disposal like the normal customers. " 
Arrange alone that but the TÚ mustn't at least meet strange. 
Moreover a large question for the ÚOHS opens himself. 
Do the telephony suppliers before a such process close the eyes, why ban they himself against a potential supplier? 
There is to add, that the ÚOHS Aufdeckung such activities really strong competences to, and if he not likes, not must he himself with the explanation the supplier, they knew nothing it and her business condition this bans, zufriedengeben. 
When the Czech Republic are no longer at expensive 
As already time and again stresses in text, the market entry of potential suppliers taught a clear price decline the unlike provisions of services. 
Where on top of that have practically tried in all countries, been potential suppliers, the classic suppliers, who genesis practically to prevent more or inferior. 
The using from they arguments were practically identical -- a too small, respectively. too very saturating market, problem by the quality of the provisions of services etc. 
In the anticyclone developed countries though the regulation organs just now intervened in these times, who by no means the interests the telephony suppliers, the separates their customer to wahren tried. 
There is or niece formal through formal measures impression, they achieved that the first potential operator was born, and this one followed large. 
Unfortunately the Czech regulation organs speed himself the whole fall too like a warm potato. 
Ready from our experience not we we the impression entledigen, that more than favourable confusion in the competences in these falls. 
Despite everything we do not throw the gun away in grain. 
If a potential supplier and soon emerges the background information stimmen, the Czech market will perhaps soon again set himself in motion in. 
, If a supplier admits the genesis of a potential telephony supplier will not be passively that ÚOHS, if there go darum, to refuse( discriminate). large amateur 
And the Czechs then finally no longer telefonieren expensive as the rest of Europe.

How do such automatons look? 
They are red, remind about ticket duck worthy, they perhaps already noticed jovická Roztyly, Bud Florenc and Vltavská, Pavlova, in the U railway stations the passengers. 
"Currently there gives in the town of five they, until year end however he eighty his", add Opatrný. 
An automaton controls instead of the driver the coupon 
The service of the automatons, who to work, is easy. 
One mustn't only the flea card of, and the beforehand acquiring coupon plays from himself. 
The electronic coupons not worth as of tomorrow only in the capital only also in the surroundings,.

The Sudeten called from the U.S for a people decision 
The sudetendeutschen the Böhmerwaldes in year of 1945 around the Angliederung at the U.S require. 
This hervor goes out of a letter, who maintains in the collections of the south Romany scientific library. 
If cannot we not component of Germany or Austria, so we the U.S at least under the patronage from America to live. 
With a such wish 1945 some groups from Sudetendeutschen shall turned to the American presidents. 
This hervor results under other from a letter, who been support in a private archives of and the today in the collections of the south Romany scientific library keeps. 
The Germans from Krumau ask the American president in the letter, he the return the" Sudetengaus" -- who from Hitler were taken on the basis of the Münchener treaty by Hitler -- at the Tschechoslowakei not erlauben. 
"We have aright understood the situation and we will be really sure of the words, that not the American units as Unterdrücker and enemies German territory go in, separate as liberators", he calls in a letter, the with the words" of man, who the fate of the Sudeten at stroke are" signed. 
That since the connection lets suppose the sudetendeutschen-- in knowledge of the Czech national character-- at the Tschechoslowakei, they brutality, rücksichtslosigkeit, incomprehension, oppression and dignities wait for slavery, ask the authors of the letter the American presidents, for today and on eternal to assume the protection domination over the Böhmerwald. 
"We can not believe, that you without consideration on the view of a quarter million inhabitant this area a for we foreign state these, who minorities oppress and to abolish nothing and tries purely good to victory of the allies contributed", is in the letter to read. 
The reason in contrast, why the authors can not sign, supposedly the fear before revenge gelüsten who Czech Unterdrücker"". 
If the American president doubts at the opinion who Böhmerwalddeutschen feel, there is sufficient, if he initiate a people decision in Böhmerwaldgau over, above who inhabitants part the U.S development the U.S lives or under the protection domination. 
Although the text the letter the Nachkriegsgeschichte in present knowledge a little naively klingen likes, he marks a good picture as for the former waits of the sudetendeutschen however after opinion of some time witnesses. 
Even if mustn't at least guess the Romany Germans, that one negotiate over her repression out of the republic, himself only granted few from they a such possibility at all a. 
Some waited, that the U.S and Great Britain a way autonomy aushandeln dignities for the Sudeten. 
Again others believed, they cannot stay simply in the Tschechoslowakei. 
Who confirm also the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who out of Budweis do date back. 
He was started in war as stall wise German by the navy at the ostsee by he. 
When one he in a prison camp after Holstein brought, dozens large Romany German devolved on him, he shall teach them Tschechisch. 
"They believed, if heimkämen they, they the Czech to suit kommen", thus Chalupa. 
Nobody the German prisoner of war, who had lived before the war in the Tschechoslowakei,, that one he the Bene- on the foundation expected it his opinion after to drive away decrees out of the republic. 
You do not think-- then pay! 
An emotionsgeladene campaign addresses himself at motorists 
Expensive action to security on the streets in the Czech history. 
Also so to characterize the emotionsgeladene media campaigns gave up, who the traffic ministry to throw at Wednesday. 
The authority ebí ek from minister Ale promises it of, drivers from dangerous behavior behind what do to dissuade steering wheel.

And what in the Spots shown? 
Above all histories from men, who to appeal to emotions. 
It the" bleeding" slogan of the whole campaign also proves: 
You do not think-- then pay! 
The words" do not think" stay in grossbuchstaben on a feature shield. 
And in a blood puddle then declare what word" pays". 
This shall mean that one can pay a time for unruliness with the own life. 
The Spots will shock the spectators until 2010"". 
The ministry left inspirieren, where one can look pictures at all normal with drastic acceptances from accident victims with himself from similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries. 
He promises itself it, that thus and the accident number the number the traffic victim street drop on the Czech. 
The Spots from the agency euros RSCG composed. 
Sugar bread and of riding whip for the motorists 
"For the drivers the currency concerns sugar bread and whip. 
Sugar bread means, that they, if they for example go by Rot, to save time. 
The riding whip is then the threat of a punishment or of an accident. 
The driver must be reminded about the risk", thus who án traffic psychologist the hospital Na Homolce Martin Ko. 
And therefore information campaigns negative in the press and before all advertising necessary, mean the psychologist. 
Already less effective his opinion after tables, who the drivers make on a danger attentive. 
"One a static table a, who warns of a danger, this one soon gets verfließen likely with the surroundings, and the drivers they no longer notice", mean án Ko.

Questions after the accident: Are stewards in bus illegal? 
The law does not know them, in a distant coach the Umherlaufen is not allowed 
In link with what nearby tragic accident someone buses the society student agency the Italian Padua the question turns out, whether steward and traveller during the ride in bus hin-- and herlaufen. 
"'ll and'll we strict formal the law, so the activity of a steward in contradiction sticks to law over the road traffic", thus who spokesmen the traffic ministry Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, by what a zweiundzwanzigjährige flight attendant last week died, probably the of driver truck causes, who what did bus pass the way. 
On what the young woman purged misfortune next to the driver, am wenigsten sure place in car, although she still had two large places to arrangement in this time to all. 
A bus however also or clearly an accident credit bremsen, in who the steward adjusts coffee or journals in the time. 
A also comes into play, whether the bus is also endowed the vehicle letter after with Stehplätzen. 
, If this is not sensed in bus the travelers must sit. 
The distant coaches from student agency no Stehplätze; What ura the director the enterprise, Radim of Jan confirmed. 
"We have discussed with the ministry this, and this first not approved the movement from travelers. 
Later on had one this, and we have were sufficient to a consensus, wonach the travelers during the ride on the toilet go cannot, if they have her seat", he informed his viewpoint. 
The law knows no steward 
"There are no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward-- no right-wing prescription describes this role. 
There however also have no right-wing prescription, who he forbids the Beförderer to provide provisions of services. 
The law over the road traffic knows only the term vehicle guides; What he does however not define law and of obligation ", the spokesman of the ministry Hanzelka clearly adds. 
The director of the department street vehicle of the traffic ministry of Josef Pokorný on the other hand thinks that this problem subsequently covers the law. 
"He arrives it, whether the bus also has Stehplätze in the product admission. 
That is then all", he stresses. 
Buses divide himself in town fine, where there are Stehplätze and the maximum speed limits of, nahverkehr fine with Stehplätzen and allows speed and distant coaches without Stehplätze with the high authorized speed and seats, the with security straps endowed. 
, How in airplane the specialist says 
Who BESIP-Fachmann see ín for traffic security Jaroslav Ho in the movement from stewards aboard of someone buses no fundamental problem. 
"A lot do not threaten liquid by someone Fahrweise of dangers, who situation aboard an airplane comparable to the service. 
Also here is not certainly, when turbulences come, and the flight attendant can wheel himself the head. " 
"However a bus clearly slows down, then the laws naturally also concern the physics. 
Likewise in town bus or in a tramway. 
The Beförderer must clarify through internal prescriptions the security of the stewards", he says and also think that this problem is not completely solved out of the visibility of the law. 
Jan ura ready, to paint the provisions of services 
Student agency affords provisions of services as single bus enterprise. 
The enterprise occupies about 200 persons in this function. 
The director does also not than risk fertile at look at her job after the accident. 
"As soon as me but who impression gets, that the job of the steward is risk fertile, I will paint him. 
The travelers by boarding can get coffee and of journal. 
That drop also the expenses ", he means. 
As interest at the security the director from Asiana Alexej Litvin founds the absence from stewards in his fines. His society however activates only a fraction from lines in comparison with student agency. 
"We have no flight attendants, in contrast we already ab initio defend. 
Whatever mortal early or later on this ends in accident ", he had expressed before not all an year for Týden.cz. 
That was an incredible tragedy 
By accident of someone of Linienbusses after Naples been an young flight attendant out of the area Pilsen, the two year for the society worked. 
The slowenische truck was likely without to sparkle of hard shoulder turned and had what the ride jams bus. 
The driver of the fine tried to avoid through a sharp manoeuvre, however kollidierte with the right front with the truck. 
That have been sold the two places for the stewards, contest ura Jan. 
"These places can be not reserved by distant connections, she is jammed." 
Enterprise will lodge complaint drivers. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman not be the agency on the court judgment, a financial damage replacement however also expect them from sides of the culprit. 
An amendment? 
Not in visibility 
An exact regulation of the movement from stewards aboard of a buses a legal regulation bringen, a dreißigköpfiges Expertenteam the traffic ministry already over an year works. 
"This however have were still sufficient to no concrete end. 
Buses do no longer stay absolutely on the agenda, rather the point system", according to specialist Ho ín. 
"The traffic ministry looks at the activity of the stewards not as something, what the security of the travelers cannot imperil important", according to Hanzelka, where who test of the security of the buses in the competence of the police and of the work protection authorities is. 
Düsseldorfer hope rests on Frankfurt 
At tall words he does not fail in the letter of the WestLB-Vorstands at the collaborators of the house. 
Through a Zusammenführen from units of the Düsseldorfer institute with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank" the central house of the group" can be born, he calls gotten in that at Monday known letters. 
The WestLB brought a" competence block" with lasting yield force in a such business in. 
And at all a such connection the decisive impulse too large union lungs his in country bank sector. 
So it reads himself, if a management committee in difficult time aptitude will demonstrate. 
Thus the angeschlagene WestLB still stays under enormous impression. 
Not only on behalf of the EU-Kommission, only also through the union institute for finance provision supervisor, the who only recently had nordrhein-westfälischen country government, the time insists, to find a future solution. 
From an always took connection between the Deka-Bank, who savings bank customer investment back kennen because of she, and the WestLB is however already the speech-- also on frankfurters side. since plain time 
Indeed have Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas the semester numbers end Aug learnings by the plan, in a fusion of the house at the Mainzer mainroad with a country bank, about the Helaba or of the WestLB, he sees no sense. 
Despite everything to lead the board of director of the Deka, who ever and the savings bank bandages to half from the country banks sedate talks over common activities with the WestLB, the management committee charges,. 
On top of that there cannot go around the market business or of parts it. 
The talks have in fact just now only, so he calls at finance place, started. 
From the Deka-Bank, who belongs with her 3000 collaborators to the important employers at finance place Frankfurt, not once the speech to first, if there go around consolidation in savings bank sector. 
2003 he thus looked a time long, when knows the Deka-Bank with the country bank Rhineland-Palatinate and who Helaba merge. 
Dreierbund out of this one nothing however got. 
Hardly the plans had gotten public, the hessische country government against a participation of the Helaba daran pronounced. 
Also the two other houses did then not zueinander find. 
Who country bank Rhineland-Palatinate went instead of what at the country bank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. 
Despite everything the Deka-Bank always again given him thought games over a connection with country banks. 
In the end however himself Günther Merl pronounced. 
Independent it however seem who to mature discovery, that a Zusammenrücken the unlike houses the under public law sector distress make. 
, After the parliament election is now in Bavaria past näherrücken a connection the BayernLB as first with the country bank Baden-Württemberg. 
For the Helaba that is not absolutely a good news. 
The impression of too large fusions shall increase, the partners in contrast out of and handle her. 
In south she were nurmehr junior partners, although they up to now by far better supported the financial crisis as the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A Zusammengehen with the west LB anew the savingsbanks -- and transfer bandage Hessen-Thüringen, the with 85 percent at the Helaba participates, beginning the year a riegel blown. 
At most the stayed north LB. 
Such geostrategischen reflections are however only who a side. 
On the other there leave around the question, how the unlike business models of the single houses zueinander suit. 
In Jun Merl expressed, the decisive question, with who future aptitude the country banks provided to get, savingsbanks of German -- and transfer bandage so far not replied. 
In the end the west LB cannot declare also an analysis, for who am however there not wished selbstredend. 
So thus also the local management committee it the speech in the letter, he gets anyway a" total solution" for the house bid. 
To bring let that single with the Zusammengehen units with the Deka-Bank under an hat, will still appear. 
The second Wiesnwochenende is as" Italian weekend" known 
For Elena there is the first, for Luca arrange the third or fourth time. 
Yes this time Elena as his friend with in addition to, and so differently all, he says. 
Behind they, by five litre beer barrel of the mark emperor, a stays massive built bearded and who about 200 October party travelers prove, what deep his throat colours hervorbringen.

Three buses above all the Italians caveats in a bus Brazilians travel exclusively. 
In a corner of the place the south Americans next to their flag already sing, celebrated already they in the night. 
And so aloud, Marco Guarda tell, that nothing for Italians.

On who and already the buses in the night, Autostrada direction" Brennero wheel ". 
There have no beer, still not. 
Quickly he gets quiet in bus, the travelers sleep. 
Merchandise according to, they will still need their force. 
Salaries in Brixen and in wood churches, where etliche other buses also little still once put a break on with Italian features at the freeway of 8 before Munich. 
Als Marcos group in the end planmässig in order half seven clocks in the precociousness on the place close who Theresienwiese arrive, buses there already support all Europe at the 50 other. 
Elena, Luca and the other assemble, Marco holds a last speech, explain the attack plan. 
Firstly: To put on the yellow käppchen. 
It" October party" stays leftwards, Internet address in Fraktur, next to who from Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it". 
Secondly: "If the doors rise up to beer tent, he calls laufen!", call Marco in the mornings hinein. 
"Run!" Run and the places in aft part of the tent occupy. 
"Not ahead, otherwise we jam, and not all yellow bonnets on same benches, in space share!" 
Who measure, howl Marco, cost 8,25 euro. 
And tip not forgotten. 
"To show the security people, that we behave well! 
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone!" 
Thirdly: "Today evening point of half eleven again here meet!" Understood? 
And already Wiesn go s to'. 
On the way someone ties yellow caps when way marks at the trees, at shields up. 
Will be gewappnet for the retirement one. 
He the second Wiesnwochenende. 
There are not exact indications of over numbers; The speech from 50 000 from who to continue on the way over the highmountainpastures and in the beer tents collapse of, ten percent of all visitors his at this weekend additional out of Italy angereist. 
The Munich police the Bavarian red Red Cross is been through seven policemen out of Südtirol, Italian voluntary helpers supported by Italian voluntary helpers, the a nation statistics behaves, in who the Italian before British person (about 60 commitments) and Austrians (about 80) with round 200 medical supplies the first place justifies. 
Particularly loved by Italians that is Hofbräuzelt. 
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relative steady, finance ministers Peer Steinbrück only stressed in who week past. 
Well, that, that the German bank sector is not spared from the krisenhaften development. 
Thus have henceforward taken place at weekend. 
Who Dax quote Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo Real Estate( HRE) gets in from a consortium of German banks a billion credit, in order himself abzuschirmen abzuschirmen out from the turbulences at the markets. 
A private with the situation person recited Reuters at Monday, who credit helps amounted of himself until to 35 billion euros. 
The Hypo Real Estate only the part the, who she also takes in entitlement. 
How the money not only withdraws from private also under public law banks. 
Losses by the girl Depfa are background. 
The Staatsfinanzierer himself according to a journal report for long deadline projects, for who he have lent money, extremely short-term refinanziert -- what is meanwhile no longer because of the distrust at the markets possible. 
In first semester of 2008 the liquid reserve the bank euros around 95 percent on 2,37 million diminished, also the egg gene capital quota had slightly given in from 1,6 on 1,45 percent. 
The standard yields and the Nettoerträge out of businesses had bended down compared with the period of time on zero, the yields out of Zuschreibungen to claim and affirmative bond as euros out of the resolution from rückstellungen in credit business around more than 70 percent on 5 million gone down. 
Only thanks to high yields out of reimbursements from nachgelagerten Verrechnungskosten out of the restructuring of the former Depfa-Gruppe as out of the reimbursement from interests after the reduction order and out of the business besorgung for conglomerate enterprises, had what yield deficits let still abolish fashion council with about 16 percent. 
Who marriage time Staatsfinanzierer foremost verspekuliert himself after his privatisation in year of 1990 with professional real-estate business credits, who had been then ausgegliedert in the Aareal bank. 
, Because one too little deserved Staatsfinanzierung in the classic then had the Depfa in infrastructure projects and the financing of private from community projects investors and of the state commit( Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and international diversifizierrt. 
On the value of the girl the Hypo Real Estate must now proceed to amortisations, who a" important material effect" on the profit-- and bill of the group credit gets rid, call it really indeterminate. 
Fact is, that the dividend was painted. 
Already for 2007 she had gotten around two thirds gekürzt. 
The Hypo Real Estate an important state-- and Infrastrukturfinanzierer. since the Depfa-Übernahme 
She is strong when other institutes Interbankenmarkt from the Refinanzierung at dependent, since she has no customer deposits. 
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers before two weeks again largely the tender under the banks dry up, since the banks horten their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate yearly needs the Kreditportfolios the Depfa short-term means Refinanzierung for a part-- round 50 billion euros-- to. 
After communication of the Hypo Real Estate, the Finanzierungsbedarf the group with the credit on foreseeable time extended and the enterprise" of influence who currently largely incompetent international money markets "abgeschirmt out. 
Out of other sources to hear, that the Refinanzierung is guaranteed thanks to the money until end of 2009. 
The HRE-Vorstandsvorsitzende Georg spark declared, in contrast that group gets the Hypo Real Estate the money markets on foreseeable time no longer in entitlement take. 
Union bank and the union institute for finance service performance supervisor( BaFin), that the market aptitude of the Hypo Real Estate is henceforward guaranteed group leave from it. 
That goes back for shareholder and of believer on the bank hoffen. 
However against the dynamics and of imponderables of the crisis there are well no certainty. 
Even not unthinkable unthinkable, that am not taken the financing in full extent in entitlement. 
Though also the opposite is not auszuschleißen. 
, After still assisted the bank at late Sunday evening the vernehmen after before the insolvency also gets who the morale not to appease at least temporary rescue. 
The share price collapses around 75 percent on 3,30 euros. 
Really good the loan courses hold in contrast. 
The priority mistakes last himself hardly restless to prove, the courses the who Nachrang-Anleihen clear after. 
Affected above all the loans the early girl enterprise Württemberg Hypo and of intelligible evidence the exceeding 2009 durations. 
After who Hypo-Real-Estate-Anleihen once seem a speculative installation alternative, and only clear hardening the bank crisis the institute even, that the Depfa himself the crisis with the resumption in house caught up, when the international finance system from the stability dependent betrachtet. 
While the chip business banks are still ready to support of the system, while the retirements from a fristgemässen repayment left. 
Or however he that take place, what someone currently hardly still to hope dares -- that the financial crisis is topped 15 months in the future. 
Despite everything against who himself broken with the part nationalization messages a justified hope have currently only gotten out of the abutting on security probability. 
That above all long time creditors some sleepless nights with the decision some, whether he shall separate from their commitment. 
Short time investors can all the same form a schlussstrich it to use a loss conference of late for the future indemnity tax payments on course profits years. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box 
Als Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 themselves first at school day at the Tachibana Highschool vorstellen, the girls to chuckle begin: The German is kawaii total""! 
What does that mean? 
Sylvana already knows the word out of mangas-- in new Austausch-Log she talks to Japan. 
"The first school day in Japan. 
I was annoyed. 
Already before the school way I had Bammel. 
I live at edge of Tokios in direction Kawasaki and take 40 minutes with the train to Tachibana Highschool. 
I mustn't find the way alone, fortunately I not occurred. 
How does not seem at the Tachibana to thus severe determined at home by we in Niedersachsen. 
What pupils tailspin a the as of eight clocks, until around twenty before nine a short discussion round with the teacher baits, 'home room'. 
, Yes before the teaching started I was at the line, to present me. 
In addition to not at all me the type, who speaks gladly up before people, still inspired before someone it from 40 pupils. 
Because I still had no school uniform, I have put an old jive of my guest mother on, it blouse, blue sock and black leather shoe. 
In this lift, aright to pronounce all: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' -- I call Sylvana, get out of Germany and birthday in a week. 
In the time were very happy, that already had me before merchandise two years, the language to learn. 
The 31 girls in the class and continuously me the word" Kawaii" belong. 
I already knew out of my manga that. 
He belongs to survival important vocabulary of Japanese girls and mean sweet', süss'. 
Then I am fast on my place gehuscht. 
The girl next to me have giggled relatively great, she found it an honor, that the swap pupil shall sit next to she. 
The rest of the hour was quietly considerable, despite everything than who Gong did soften, I was attacked real. 
All talked higgledy-piggledy and chuckled and holes in the stomach-- to understand Japanese with difficulty, in addition to there is authentic English. asked me 
In the break all then undid her Bentos. 
A Lunchbox also thus made me-- that is once something other of German as the doleful break bread. my guest mother 
Me and rice salad a way meat with kräutern, small Würstchen, out of cucumber and of seaweed, fruit in Tofumantel. 
Most of the time I have no pale glimmer, what exactly I here eat in Japan. 
The things look strange and recently taste absolutely. 
Party declares that all is authentic delicious. 
Naja, perhaps putting on plums salty, brrrr! 
The Bentos not only simply lunches at Japanese schools. 
He sometimes comes, that a girl a boy a even prepare Bento offers, what she then executes particularly kunstvoll -- in the hope, who to learn kennen boys by close Pausensnack. 
It I have read in my manga comic-strip. 
I am once tightened up, whether I can here also watch that. 
'Thus rightly Japan?', have had my friend, when I told them, that I will go for an year in Tokio to school. 
I have then always said: 
"Because he now once fascinates me." 
In the end I already read preferably mangas since years. 
, And in order I inside better understand the comic-strips and the cultivation I have also one day begun, a little Japanisch to learn. 
For me was then clearly absolutely, that I mustn't one day hereabouts travel. 
Thus me also a weakling for tradition, wont and of custom. 
And on the one here puts tall value on. 
On the one hand Japan a country the new esten technology and of trend-- auf der anderen Seite there is severe, disciplined and traditional. 
, And because all is thus good organise here also still not had me lost, even if Tokio is the tall town, who I have ever shown up up. " 
Also rats have feelings 
A rat or a cockroach flees by danger that means that they also feel fears? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Also much animals have feelings. 
Only how did one know überprüfen whether they feel the same, if they similar to himself like we restrained? 
In the internet publication" Edge" contributions of famous scientists are published since several years. 
Mirrors online presents choose in a series answers to the matter" what to stop you for wahr, without he cannot prove?" 
I believe that sensation and other conscience condition have animals, without up to now otherwise me or irgendwer this proofs where we can not even yes prove, that consciences have other men. 
However in this case we can at least hope, all human brains same reason configuration aufweisen like. 
As soon as of the empfindens or all generally the conscience anschneiden, we go in for impracticable soil, because the hardware not agrees. 
, If a rat meets in danger she makes the same like a lot other animal: She stands dead, flee or attack. 
Men behave similar, woraus many scientists on a comparable subjective erleben close. 
daran I do however not believe. 
Two aspects of the brain pattern make it difficult to translate our subjective erleben on that from animals. 
To someone to close who präfrontalen almost always assoziierten with the human conscience schaltkreise the lateral Cortex a (because of his participation at short time memory and at the version --/ piloting functions). 
Is men by much high developed when by the remaining primates and to fail seem by other creature complete. 
At least by those aspects of our conscience, what Cortex depends präfrontalen on, darunter what learnings, who we are, and the aptitude to plan ahead and to decisions, then pass reason for the assumption, that the man even differs primates from the other. 
A large dramatic feature cannot find in the linguistic nature of the man: Since a thus tall part of his erlebens is associated with language, it often orders, the conscience slopes it as of. 
In this fall one cannot exclude animals. 
, Yes even if conscience not depended on language were be this one he certain, so that bestial conscience, how he also provides likes himself, probably very from the many of our conscience condition distinguished. 
Therefore to establish, like consciences with difficulty appearance by other animals. 
If he himself. 
The many of my version bear on the content of the aware erlebens, despite everything there next door still have a large aspect of the conscience, who his scientific easy accessible. 
One cannot examine the conscience lawsuits from animals without consideration on her content, and exactly that happens by studies over the short time memory from primates, in particular at example of the Visualisierung. 
Despite everything by this approach, the Christof cook and Francis Crick handled, one rather transfers the neuralen correlative of the conscience when on the causal mechanisms: Both no longer like identical his otherwise. 
Curiously this approach also stresses the meaning of the präfrontalen Cortex for the Zustandekommen of the Visualisierung. 
What now produces himself for the sensations? 
I bring them back it, that an emotional system the fear his own activity aware brain like that in someone activated. 
What we than to qualify" fears", then the mental condition, in what we seal, if the activity the locating in brain defence system (or who consequences, physical reactions) work memories justify. 
Thus seen sensations are tied closely up at the areas of the Cortex, the primates and in particular the man label. 
Distinguished Abstufungen of the empfindens indulge in associations with the linguistic nature, because 
On the other hand Antonio Damasio for example think, that sensations the Cortex and of the Hirnstammes hervorgehen out of primitive activities in the body feeling areas similar to Jaak Pankseep, who himself on the brain tribe concentrate. 
, Since this network have much not changed himself in run of the human evolution can be participated absolutely in him at type comprehensive sensations. 
Purely theoretic I can not contradict that, it considers however for unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argue, what by rats and men like fear appear, feel probably also in two fall: How though can one verify whether rat and of man feel the same, if they behave similar? 
Does a cockroach flee by danger whether she also feels fears? 
In my eye just behaviour resemblance can still prove no Erlebensgleichheit. 
Indeed the neurale comparison beyond helps: Rat and of man in contrast similar brain tribes, cockroaches not even a brain. 
Though is the brain tribe responsible for sensations? 
And himself if one cannot prove that for the man: How'll one prove him by rats? 
I believe, that rat and other mammals of, perhaps even cockroaches (who does know?), sensations have. 
However I did not know, how I shall prove that. 
And because fundamentally himself her sensation alleged from the our distinguish( since the human conscience rests on on special schaltkreisen and on language), I study preferably the emotional behavior as the emotional sensations from rats. 
At any rate progresses on the neuralen plain here wave, according as one sises the same by rat and of man. 
As I not study language and conscience by rats, according to no longer sensations, I do thus not know whether they exist. 
One likes that for short-sighted keep, forwards, than continuously to run against a wall get away kind. 
Me rightly a practical Emotionalist.

Dark matter influences flight from space probes 
Since years a mysterious phenomenon by forschen attends to disarray: Dark matter influences the speed from space probes during thus so-called Swing-by-Manöver. 
To fear expert, that the general relativity theory Albert Einsteins cannot not all aright be. 
Almost the space probe of" Ulysses" flew through the space 18 years. 
Ways soon the cold death now threatens her of frozen fuel directions. 
Under scientists a mysterious phenomenon attends since years to confusion-- the Swing-by-Anomalie. 
The Swing-by a flight manoeuvre from space probes, they additional momentum a sky body in Gravitationsfeld of, about the land, get. 
Thereby the probes can abolish many fuel. 
The American probe of Cassini-Huygens take likewise as the probe of Ulysses hold this physical trick. 
What the researchers however already surprise in addition to since years: The flight bodies do not thus, as one wait for him after the altehrwürdigen Gravitationsgesetz behave 100-prozentig. 
Rather it comes to irregularities in the speed. 
The probes get unexpected or slowly fast. 
Up to now the physicists cannot not explain this effect. 
They baptised him Swing-by-Anomalie. 
To fear some experts, that perhaps even the general relativity theory Albert Einsteins, who the magnetism the space from matter through a curvature describe, not all accurate to be. 
Who Advanced Study believes American physicists Stephen eagles of institute for out of Princeton after as before party daran, that Einstein not makes mistake, and try the Swing-by-Anomalie to explain cooperation of the so-called dark matter, the astronomers in universe continued. 
"Responsible for the anomaly dark matter being knew, who himself also all nearby to seal", he writes. 
From the existence of the dark matter the space researchers only know since about ten years. 
From she a magnetism visibly leaves for, who effect let watch himself on other sky body. 
They selber is on the other hand absolutely invisible, that calls, she sends and reflect no elektromagnetische radiation, in particular rightly also no visible light. 
After the calculations of the scientists a fünftel of the total measures of the universe all the same continues well the dark matter.

He will newly'll treat Place, around a clean crossing to the shops and of shops, who in the new buildings erwartet, to create. 
To the other worshippers the long-standing neighborhood, who say belongs, she is fascinate from the short alley, easy because they someone the remnants the past the häuserblocks. 
Despite everything the town administration department, who concerned about protection and of institution of the Wohngebäude is and concerned about the street is, no interest daran, to get them. 
During a session of the committee for Landnutzung of the towncouncil in this month representatives the town administration and Avalon Bay a proposal the street for the purchase through the building enterprise conceived. 
However the committee prefers, that the street the town in the hands stay, and after a new plan asked, who in future month subjected, according to Susan Stetzer, the sector official in towncouncil of 3 
"Have left the town in property only very few space and we liked that treat Place still belongs to the town", she dissociated. 
"It cannot be offers, as, what cannot from Avalon, thus we, that the public access stays guaranteed also want." 
Avalon Bay have announced before some months, who small street newly paves and seats manage am thought what for a café, at that enterprises space to vermieten what. 
The idea that the street cannot buy Avalon Bay, was made to first time during the session in this month public. 
Michele of Milly, a spokesman of Avalon Bay, told that the street'll indeed take hold the enterprise 
"The main request of the Avalon Bay to restore this dilapidated alley and to make he to a public appointment", said she and on top of that added that the town had even proposed the sale. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman of the department for building protection meant, he really the wish the town former, the street, who task is the department he rather the to elaborate realestate businesses as manage. 
Compared to his many-coloured neighborhood The Bowery, a little Place additional from his historical impression maintains. 
Some believe, that had the street her name in year of 1802, as a tall farm, the Philip Minthorne necessary, between his numerous child distributed and a narrow patrols country from no claimed. 
The back door of the club CBGB, the monument, what were closed in year of 2006, opened to treat Place and the street safely most bekannt as wing for the photo on the Cover the album "Rocket to Russia" from Ramones. 
The cobblestone the manager of the Ramones, who the photo had made in November of 1976 magnificent, Danny Fields dissociated,. 
The street was poster, leaf and rope full of scrap, rag and part from barrels,. 
Plain inhabitant, enclosed of the Blogger, who the East Village letters over the Gentrifizierung, credit the idea of the sale from treat Place refused, with the argument, that this public ground, thus humble there is, still public to stay. 
Others Place a practically unaltered splinter the town, who were let in calms additional as a scarcity gepriesen. 
Jeremiah Moss, who name" Jeremiahs vanished N.Y" activate the Blog (untertitelt with "the book of the complaints: A bitter nostalgic glance on the disappear town"), a part the talk the town history over treat Place publish, the new in the publication" The yorker" in year 1952 appeared. 
The author, Brendan Gill, have then written: "Additional a small narrow cul-de-sac, who even tagsüber stays dark is and the warehouses through rust metal door Place, withdrawn windows and at flew along week old men journals characterised". 
With few exceptions the street have thus recently looked exact at an evening. 
A rat ran the street through the aft part, not far away from the door, who CBGB early led to, where an expensive garment business today seals. 
Graffiti to see on the walls and an empty beer bottle did not find on the floor far from a fresh bundle from operating journals. 
Some passersby said, they rarely thought about treat Place, thus proposed, that were a little aufpoliert the street. 
Fields, on top of that added that, plain after his opinion people underestimate the stimulation of the street in her present condition. 
The good years of my life, he said, were in the places, who dark, humid and repulsive. 
Debate around bilingual training: Formation in English-speaking surroundings 
In this expense of the" Education Watch" discuss Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi the positions of the candidates to bilingual training. 
, Managing scientific collaborators in Kalifonischen study and managing director in department of formation science at the Pacific Research institute for a Mitverfasser of the book" is not thus good Public Policy, as one thinks: Why a school choice needs the mean class ". 
To answer the hispanischen electors an intricate task. 
Barrack of Obamas proposals to topic formation a typical example in contrast. 
Obamas election campaign mentions, what the probability by afro-amerikanischen and hispanischen pupils" who school to close successfully, low is, by white pupils" -- what ballots. 
, Around this performance distance to schliessen a bilingual footbridge phase in the training for this recommends Obamas formation plan special under other, the English only learns. 
Who however the question at Obama consists in inside, whether his commitment for the bilingual training, puts the centre of gravity languages on on teaching in other as English, his interest contradicts, to reduce the distance in the school performances. 
We as example" Sixth Street Prep" take, a primaryschool in oriental fate of Angeles. 
The majority of the pupils is hispanisch and families struggle through with low income. 
More as a third of the pupils, only many since short in country, English learns. 
However pupils of the fourth class have passed surprising in 2008 100 percent the state examination in Mathe on a good level. 
Surprising equally 93 percent the children out of the fourth school year in the examination when evaluates well. 
This surprising success been with other methods, when this, who from Obama be to prefer by Obama. 
The school Sixth Street puts her centre of gravity in checking and of exercise, on constant and test the knowledge a position, who no exceptions tolerate. 
The large the school practises the approach, after what the training occurs in a English-speaking surroundings. Exactly that is the point, shall who Obama, according to the school director Linda Mikels. 
This approach puts value in the almost exclusive use of the English language. 
Mrs Mikels, who does the idea of bilingual training refuse the,, who school had a remarkable success with a pupil said to me, only little in front of out of Mexico come. Late of 12 months one cannot and no longer recognise the class space betreten him. 
"He works", she marked down," he works for we". 
Obama a school Latin-American and others like the" Sixth Street Prep" as model for other school with tall part English learnt pupils expect? 
The performances of the school be the answer to this question light, thus the bildungspolitischen positions inside his own party( the national Bildunsgvereinigungen for years support the idea of bilingual training) and his own consistent support of the bilingual training continues predictions over Obamas answer uncertain. 
That while he approves the point, migrants English to learn, recently trivialisiert he the topic himself worries manufacture over the aims at" only English" legislation, while he noticed, that men shall stop,. 
stattdessen, he said: "She to provide, that Spanish knows your child". 
If Obama will really close the performance distance, he shall take carefully models into account, who to work, instead of.

Team record through series in second quarter aufgestellr 
innenverteidiger Shaun Ellis believed, that had had he all, after he often failed achteinhalb years in the last as everybody other in Jets-Trikot. 
Then he looked at Sunday at the second quarter, in who the Jets changed a fruitless game in a triumph train. 
"So a little I have still never seen", Ellis dissociated. 
After a neglected game between the Jets and who Arizona Cardinals, what the bad weather corresponded, the second quarter began. 
When however Quarterback board Favres passport by Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard-Touchdown arrived, that marked the perfect preamble to an afternoon at the her himself elaborate cooperation a giant step after ahead made. 
Favre and once found Coles the other 10 seconds the half time in this quarter for still two Touchdowns, what someone once skidded as an Aussenverteidiger before end. 
"I have not particularly strained", say Coles over the passports to the to Coles went. 
"He is a gas player. 
Our vote have balloted, equal what do the people think. " 
While Favre and Coles trifled with fangen, the defense Quarterback Kurt Warner took separately. 
Außenverteidiger Darrelle Revis intercepted a verunglückten reach and he changed 32-Yard-Touchdown in someone. 
libero of Erik Smith came at an other passport and he intercepted. 
Linebacker David Bowens then attended to a loss from Warner. 
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, probably the mad. 
The Cardinal had the ball with still 10 seconds remaining in game as the Jets reconquers and Jay Feely a 20 Yard gunshot to 34 to 0 direction changed. 
The the many points the who the Jets had never gotten in a quarter. 
When been he the insanity to beschreiben told Erik Mangini, who coach the Jets" the second quarter or the third quarters? " 
Both, then who on the Antworte Jets admitted quarters of 21 points in third without a single to get, Mangini dissociated: "Believe me, me more the second quarter friend as the third. 
An amount point was gotten in short time. " 
Rested Gebrselassie beat his world record 
Haile Gebrselassie out of Ethiopia have again shown, why many consider it for the long-distance good runner of all times, after have broken he marathon his own record in berliner at Sunday and first to man, who who route from 42,2 kilometers in fewer when 2 hours and 4 minutes geschafft. 
With the victory Gebrselassie his previous result from 2:04:26 around 27 seconds improves, what he had last year reached in Berlin. 
Gebrselassie, 35 have it his 26. world record in his versatile career places, in the he on each route from a kilometer until at least a championship title to marathon reach otherwise a world record placed. 
Last month Gebrselassie the Olympic marathon spirit in Beijing, out of fear, who perhaps exaggerated exaggerated Nachhinein in, that his asthma problem aggravates the air pollution. 
Instead he have forecast himself for the competition in Berlin. 
In almost ideal conditions-- by sun of and 9 degree at and throw 13 degree at goal-- Gebrselassie have won with a average speed from 4 minutes and of 43 seconds per mile. 
, Since railway runners have changed like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat out of Kenya on langstrecken the record time 10 years for marathon in the last around more than 2 minutes pleased, since Ronaldo since Costa aus Brazil in year 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05 won. 
After his victory at Sunday Gebrselassie have informed the press, he had convulsions in his calf before two weeks and a week cannot therefore not train. 
Visibly come back. 
"I am thus happy", he suited reporter. 
"All have run perfectly. 
I have again taken the training before a week and today still some doubts, despite everything at end what all super. " 
He was in contrast criticised -- in particular in Kenya, Ethiopia rivals out of Ostafrika -- that he organises his Rennläufe excessive, many weltbeste marathon cataract general avoid of, himself too very on the Rennanführer world records over the competition and leave, as if that were a Bahnrennen, put on. 
Yes this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassies as long-distance runners. 
Accompany Kenianern from four at Sunday Gebrselassie the centre the route in 1:02:04 accomplished. 
Two elite runners out of Kenya, James Kwambai and of Charles Kamathi still Gebrselassie challenge, after the tempo macher had diminished. 
A little more than three miles before the Finish had Gebrselassie his last beginning, in order from Kwambai to separate of, the than of second himself in arrived 2:05:36 and it his Bestzeit around almost 5 minutes improved. 
Kamathi got third parties in 2:07:48 
By women Irina Mikitenko. 
The world record from 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff out of Great Britain. 
In last spring old the 36 years Mikitenko the London marathon surprising in 2:24:14 won. 
She had the games in Beijing, because of problems, who as back injury describe. However had she, in order to win and to improve minutes her Bestzeit in Berlin in her third marathon around five. 
She have had skilfully her run, while she only let a quartet ausreissen out of Ethiopian and Kenyan läuferinnen, but after 30 kilometers surpassed. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa end Ethiopia got second in 2:21:31 while Helena Kiprop arrived out of Kenya as thirds in 2:25:01. 
Who and the proof sheets the black population proud in life, in a town of the all exceptional way 
Withhold vaguely, few between the outgrowths of the leisure parks in surroundings from Orlando miles from that sparkling, lute and of gigantic activity, are a quiet town, and the pride the complications the Afro-amerikanischen cultivation vorschein kommen to. 
Eatonville, who and black town the homeland town Zora Neale whore sound, no longer thus simply to describe whore sound he act in 1935: first complete in country "The town brown with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, of 300 skin, 300 good swimmers, of more as enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." 
Today there is a pilgrim place. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are Zora to the per year! Festival in Eatonville come in order to commemorate the Harlem rebirth the famous author. 
And however is and stay the town, who she describes and the they to a tourist excursion goal made, while they they tourist guides in the Florida took of, the to times of the depression of union writer project produced in many consideration a place of the all exceptional sort. 
ist thus independently, gediegen and private as n in the 1930er, when whore sound wrote, that rural black municipalities often refused in Florida, her true thought with the white man divide, the "thus few over we, that he not knows what he escapes know." 
Even today, in an year in the a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Sen. Barack Obama, to an open talk over breed report call, he many here moreover suffer, from outsiders watched. 
"We much been it like our history told", thus Hortense Jones, 59 from birth at a inhabitant of the town and municipality member of the old church of the town. 
He must ballot. " 
Eatonville long time the triumph and of the struggle as paradox define. 
There is not only an historical example of the black movement when also a municipality from almost 2.400 inhabitants, in who the poverty quota is thus double high like the country average. 
There is on the one hand a citadel of the literature and on the other hand an example of the -- sometimes condemned, sometimes gepriesenen -- black cultivation of the rural south, who her root has in the American slavery. 
Not surprising surprising, that here inhabitants. 
How and so aright the doubts began as a matter of fact s image around Eatonville'with Zora, here all whore sound calls. 
She the world her homeland town in books her, who came from hearts and in patois written, so and Mules Men""( 1953) and" Their Eyes were watching God "(1973) 
Five sales in the tourist guide changed the town, who all approach the route of 77 are, a street who through the often forgotten centre of Florida guide, to the theaters from black history and human drama. 
Shameless as not only but also in the literature, whore sound represented Oskar readers first mayor, Joe Clarke, and in real life to the shop from Eatonvilles private matters then turned. 
"Left to abseits the street", she wrote," the seals brown- weiss paint modern school, with her caring garden and playgrounds, around who Howard Miller always care about, although hardly he vine harvests and to write." 
She also mentioned the new man from widow Dash and wrote that was-auch-immer too hour zimmern suits. " 
In only few Eatonville then brought hundred words to whore sound with Selbstregierung in connection but also with, illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was all certainly no tourist guide. 
In the act this was not a Portrait, what from all were estimated by all. 
"How Zora thus described the things according to the 90 jährige Ella Dinkins, they were",, a the Johnson-Mädchen who did whore sound immortalize, while they the men quoted, the songs over what their beauty sang, who full sexual allusions. 
She added: "Many people not liked this." 
One here always still remembers at Hurtson when a sprightly Exzentrikerin regularly returned, after her family had left after Jacksonville, Florida,. 
Augustus Franklin, 77 reminded, that if whore sound in the town roared came, they this most of the time, lärmenden without warning act in someone Chevrolet, smoking and with trousers dress, in a town who even today a little imagines on her respectable garment style. 
According to sir Franklin many were been the many inhabitants, while they despised by they. 
"The people were always happy to see Zora", Mr Franklin dissociated. 
However" she did never stay to long", he added on top of that while he swung in his chair, on a timely after in the end terrace, the on does Sabelia lake look who, in what whore sound all probability after baptised. 
When whore sound died in 1960 she was poor and their book attacked. 
Together with the bulk of the world schien Eatonville she oversight. 
n, although she was long ago a famous author, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the single black Mrs at Barnard of college in the 1920er she got in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she did live, in an anonymous grave put on. 
In Eatonville there were no tall commemoration, no public readings in tall style. 
"I do not believe that they have understood otherwise her contribution her inheritance in the world in minimal", according to Valerie Boyd, author from" Wrapped in Rainbows", of someone biography over whore sound the 2003 publishes. 
The bend came in the 80er years. 
Orange County authorities'll a fünfspurige freeway through the town, in order to replace boulevard, the slow zweispurige street the Kennedy the municipality. 
Orlandos suburbs had already urged the freeway of 4 through the western outskirt. 
The proposal was subjected, when Eatonville still always sat up from a difficult phase in his history. 
Constraint integration, inter alia, the relative idyllic isolation the municipality an end put on. 
In the 50er year the struggle against Rassenvermischung brought hatreds in the community. 
"In this time a cluster of white boys often came and they and sped oranges business of sitting on the offsides people", sir Franklin said. 
"There even once had a woman who were on top of that killed. 
They threw a water melon out of the car away. " 
In 1955 the claim of the supreme court, to force integration, checked whore sound in a letter at the Orlando Sentinel while they what decision in fall Brown against the school council when" offending endow my breed respecting "qualified. 
Inhabitants today say, that though the removal was positively the rassentrennung in many consideration, they who and the group cohesion the opinion his adolescent in Eatonville weakened. 
"Black children he accustomed, hugged -- I remember daran -- one tomorrow hugged his teacher at and one hugged his teacher at evening", business distinguished according to Nathiri, girl from Ella Dinkins and director of the gemeinnützigen group to protection of the Eatonville community. 
That cannot be thus long gotten aufrecht, she inserted on top of that, until teacher and pupil no longer out of same place devolved. 
"One did not hug his white teacher, thus he was a white teacher -- I mean a cultural cleavage is existing", Mrs Nathiri dissociated. 
However the citizenships have contributed to it, that place whore sound for large Zora Neale created -- black author, actor and of artist, who over prejudices put on, so how he made them, with positive opinion and to express: "How someone can refuse himself to the joy of my society! 
I do not understand him. " 
In year of 1975 the author Alice Walker continued on the way to whore sound anonymous grave and to fight with the resuscitation of their Ruhmes began. 
Late of five years someone was many praising whore sound biography from Robert E. To find Hemenway in the libraries, and she continued renewed to a part of the American literature kanons. 
The distant street project came exactly to a time, in who Eatonvilles famous girl again once suited the public in light. 
And this time whore sound old neighbours saw them as Retterin. 
The municipality began someone whore sound festivals in order show show what the sector the freeway zerstören with the building in 1988 with the planning. 
Thousand from fans late came to the opening event two years, and many sweep for the fête each Jan backwards. 
Late some years the sector from his street plan turned away. 
"The plans of a fünfspurigen distant street restored the town, the whole with pointed speed accelerated, authentic bourgeois pride waked up", Mrs Nathiri dissociated. 
Mrs Boyd a little expressed him easy: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the distant street project have contributed to a change of the Selbstbildes of the town. 
He Zugereiste more and more came, so Rachelle Munson, a lawyer, who here go since 1993 in the church, and Einheimische began newly to estimate the past. 
Eatonville were taken 1998 in the national historical register. 
A new einstöckige library (naturally after whore sound called) boulevard opened neugepflasterten in 2006 on that and beautified Kennedy. 
Today Eatonville are still a feature in Florida: Only 6 miles of downtown-area of Orlandos sometimes anfühlen they himself like an aft alley in summer rain, thus small then n as they from only 27 black families in the 1880er founded. 
(She is today too 90% black.) 
Laymen on the research after the history of Eatonvilles and of his meaning are often always still treated with caution. 
For the many interviews an authorisation things in parking area necessary and certain -- so and the Wandbemalung elders church, who from a weissen were painted by a weissen black men from Eatonvilles by the field work represent -- not photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones,, that her abgeschirmte community is misunderstood always still fear. 
And however, to who the whore sound festival got tall, an increasing degree was also delivered at homeland pride. 
Young before all men tilt it, to see Eatonville how whore sound saw her total breed: Magnificent, with all his problem, neither bad proud assiduously, still better and likewise, creatively and albern and durchmischt everybody other breeds-- and people group in America. 
There the sincere love to this town the who cannot one nephews in the voice from sir Franklins have after the college after Eatonville to return, in order otherwise in the town administration by the police to work, the are he something help use. 
And even the young,, elfjährige like Alondra and Alexia Kenon twins out of winters park, learnt, Eatonville aright describe. 
"The many people, only here who who, be:" Alas, this town nothing the other in comparison to universe", Alondra Kenon recently told at a Sunday after the church. 
"However if one really stops and a time long his history looks, there is a very beautiful town." 
Here by we in N.Y one speaks up flowing Finanzlatein. 
On the first glance nothing have changed. 
If himself tourists in Manhattan from the journal positions and the enormous distance marriage umbrellas in times Square protected, they not at all notice that they seal middles in a debacle. 
You never believe, that over her head, in the shoe failure tel sound offices with the glass façades, bankers and Hedgefondverwalter, who the monopoly in N.Y, every day the working bad day since the fall from 1929. 
The suppliers always still unload the metallic Teewägen with great rattles along pavements and Tabletts transport the with Muffins for the breakfast sessions to load. 
latinos always still around, as human packet animals load ironing T-shirts with around the 50 shamble between apartments, the liegenden at an on her shoulder yoke similar helm slopes. 
Officeworkers always still in itself wait for the pavements sealing meal positions on her Frühstücksbagel and he always still impossible at a working day between 16 and of 19 clock a to get yellow taxi. 
He did not feel at all at as a crisis, until I because of universe of the world wrecking geredes decided Thursday on afternoon, to open a new savings account. 
Although me determined to put on my obligation speed temporary on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribe branch, approximately 20 people already suited snake. 
Where not at the counters in order, only at the counter check books order regular visitors of, tourists after the way to department-store Macy' s to wonder and new customers counts eröffnen. 
Who most before me, so later on learnt me from stare, my" personal bank employee with licence", suited out of the same reason as me snake. 
In contrast with me however, already they her sparing from small banks taken off, at places from how they leveled out, so New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Iceland. 
They money from thus mentioned Thrifts (little a bausparkasse looking), co-op bank and those local savingsbanks, who branches credit only in a state, taken off and say that they their customer like family treats. 
In last year 15 these banks go gone silent and low. 
In the last couple tagen Washington Mutual went, a bank with installations in altitude from $327 billion, in bankruptcy administration of over and when new yorker at home drove letzen Friday weekend on, Wachovia, a large bench, the Sparanlagen in value from $440 billion own of, saving on the research after someone buyers. 
In the fear of a large collapse, brought who office -- and shop employees who before me did queue her devoid up to a bank who when been sure harbor, a bank who is for the many Rettungsaufkäufe at the Wall Street responsible. 
All normal new yorker appropriated flowed in the last weeks Finanzlatein.

I receive the master behind the stage, around his character to hold', of Günter of brewer, photographer. 
No sales, no hive, no tailor for the appearance. 
The nature of the tall Flamencotänzer, who and renunciation the interpretation widmen on the concentration, around a relaxing appearance as Mrs or when to get man. 
On the one hand artists 
On the other hand personality 
I look in private life, in these times, who foreign foreign for the audience, I know, me typical for the personality gesture, someone fortifying expression fortifies depth stolen glance the hands, who gets, because they not to go the stage in in, find. 
In his project Flamenco-people'the German photographer of Günter poses abwechselungsreiche Theatralik of some productions on the stage with singer, dancers and of guitarists to bird cages dar. From this side he was for the artists still few known. 
With this proposal the photographer deletes an exceptional Ikonografie of the Flamencodarstellung on distinct plains. 
The exhibition, who the month the photograph the Flamenco to programme the belongs, reflect the international importance from Flamenco, of tag to day always tall declared, wider over', the artist and of power distinctly, that Flamenco-people'each indifferent man his, however if one looks the photos at himself, so the observer notices, that he no typical pictures from artist who stage. 
All normal men on the portraits to arrange and to incite what audience artists, who are in the situation passion, sadness, joy it on the stage. 
In order the personality of these artists cannot hold, one must make no photos on the stage. 
Her personality and her character are in her heart. 
What me did interest, to delete a personal atmosphere, to who to allow me, with the photo camera the charaktere of the tall Flamencomeister hold'. 
Bird cages, inspire of festival Cante of mine ace', continued in year of 1997 on a long journey, around singers read, Gitaristen to photograph digital camera. 
Thanks of the Bildsortierungsfunktion of the camera and the existing material, pictures, about who remind classic photograph were born. 
The application of unlike stylistic means destroys the classic foundation of the picture, wodurch who do form the modernity and the idea, how the bird cage Flamenco understands, lent: Music with traditional roots, who changes himself and each day surprizes'. 
That not only the dance, the canticle his character, who the audience tempts with his art. 
Who research after the Wesentlichen in form of the hörens, the being visible gets, and the solid goal this work, who the El Fotómata is presented time in the next in the gallery. 
Known personalities in Flamenco under they artists belong to the narrow choice of the almost seventy to Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others, the photographed. 
The project the Flamencos to an anthology and soon than book, with all portraits out of the exhibition, appear. 
Bird cage passion to the portraits guided him it, this idea before two years still time when to achieve( SportARTproject'). portraits the veterans the sport' 
Although the plans of the project Flamenco-people'are distinct, so the photographer admits he she much pleases me kennen to, to photograph the people, I and learn in who to put on life condition, he or a long time for a short time. 
I believe that the difficult type is the portrait in area of the photograph. 
You meet or trips on persons, personality, who you sometimes not know at all, otherwise they give alone you minute up for a pair, in order a photo cannot continue. 
Except from these facts as photographer I try always my idea to achieve. ' 
The collection of the portraits of the Flamencos from today with the title Flamenco-people'been in the gallery of the El Fotómata, who himself in who la calle la street Mata with the name of Alameda and square seals la to street of Hércules occurs. You can visit until to of 16. October the exhibition.

On this way the Cineast have tried to represent'an amount from personalities and social analysis, what he have always admired at the works of the famous novelist, today explained Carci by the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at beginning of a long directory the actors.

José Luis Garci, tall fan of the literature from Galdós, insures that his childhood dream'went thanks to this shooting in fulfilment. This to owe Esperanza Aguirre, who he he before three years from the autonomous community Madrid instructed, to turn someone Gedenkfilm to second century fête at 2. November in Madrid. Vor allem, because the history rests on the foundation from Episodios Nacionales', supposed who the mission at. 
The total contribution from 15 million, who from the autonomous community Madrid were put on on for shootings, afford Garci, by the autonomous community Madrid as he inserted, the sole possibility'with help from decorations of and corresponding exercises what picture of entangled Spain, what the wrong leader for the struggle looked, because the people the Ferdinands the VII through the struggle for the independence and under the domination in residue brought represent'. 
However the Cineast regrets that one knew with the financing as Goya'( twice thus high when mayo'by Sangre of) not calculate fantasmas or fate by Alatriste'of, that's why some scenes out of the scenario with Horacio Valcárcel, with the Garci fast his whole career teamed up, not turned. 
Out of this reason, Garci, who film director was also empezar'a in Volver, through his usual work way have collaborated: He expected the stage to the actors, with who one first necessity before one repeats begins to twirl and for this, who had continued, he appeared humiliating'and respect providing, a part of the job of the film director consists in inside, and help in theater in cinema carry out, around know, what in the cinema industry, one work, happen. ' 
How many actors, on what he trips mayo'in Sangre of on, must review before his camera, in fall from Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Garci, Academy Award candidate in four appointments (from who he have earned someone), the opinion and policyholder the, that nobody the three candidates, who Hollywood to replace of in this year Spain before the Academy, an young generation of the Spanish Filmographie represents. Weder Sangre of mayo', still Siete mesas of billar francés' and in the end no longer the choose film los ciegos'girasoles. 
For this film Garci waits for no distinctions. 
At beginning you believe that you work for the nachkommenschaft, later on you notice that there are only fürs gedeihen, and now you are Garci satisfied declared after more than 30 years, if one have still produced a film', job activity.

Do not over their life to tell try, separate her Esprit to bewahren,'said the Flamencotänzerin. 
Her dance foundation much helped me in Flamenco. 
The dance of the butterfly'for example met me like Guajira, or the dance of the snake'like Tango. 
Her dance was sensual and I am told, that my dance also find in this esthetical area', she claims. 
The production expects two exceptional cooperations: With Miguel Poveda, who will still once sing for Isabel by a their idea, he have also made abierta'him in La puerta; And with Flamenco-Meisterin Matilde Coral, what to work together exceptionally with a their ex pupil. 
Matilde trifles with Tórtola, a very ripe personality. 
I am happy, because she was agreed, at my work to collaborate, and I much feel dear. ' 
The production also and calculates the Gitaristen Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga with musical composition, with the canticle from Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi of Morón; With the Percussion from El Pájaro, as el the Viola Viola and of the cooperation with the actor Juanfra Júarez from Rafa, he assumes the role of the guide of the artists, the Divas merchandise, in the he himself always again verliebt. ' 
In this work one also talks on an affirmative way about life to this woman, who in find thus large places like India, the U.S or Russia and moreover in whole known Europe got, although she have normally lived in London. 
I'll remind of her in memory, thus I think, she is a from the women, an huge impact on an affirmative time and who today more and that's why still works nobody they few to estimate knows', assert Bayón. 
The idea today finds theaters Lope Vega instead of around 20:30 in of. 
Who publication of the book Diario closes casado'recién poeta un of also the Triennium a 
Who s casado'recién poeta un presentation the first illustrated expense Church( New York) from Diario of in the Saint Stephen', at a place, where Juan Ramón Jiménez 1916 Zenobia gets married, offer a corresponding atmosphere, in order expected activities the Andalusian council in mission for cultivation to achieve, around the Triennium from Zenobia and Juan Ramón '(2006-2008) to celebrate.

The U.S can present badly himself without Paul Newman 
Sometimes god deletes perfect personalities. 
Paul Newman was an he. ' 
This sentence then derives herrschenden idea the American American cinemas from the actress Sally Field, who, and from who teamed up with him in sensation reporter', what relaxed in sting, from all America until her followed. 
Now look he the Academy Awards at time, what he costed them advance bookings. 
And when he withdrew 2007. 
And he knew that he was very sick. 
All the same that was a tall blow for all. 
What someone sometimes feels, more than an expression, and now important me a tall friend lost', said Robert Redford mourning, my life and my country the tall Drolligkeiten his life. ' 
Nobody ridiculous to continue still to exaggerate fear neither himself. 
As fathers'of the cinema and of the father country been he in a sad time, in what fear before terrorists and before the market collapse rule, in that the stun self esteem of the American Americans on the desperate looks after reasons, around dignity to recover,. 
If only few men, who one can admire, to stay, so not must absolutely one Luis Cernuda his in this hard time without virtue, around Paul Newman to like. 
For all he embodied almost a Platonic ideal of the beauty and of the truth. 
He was official enemy from Richard Nixon and profits not only also underwent like unlike losses: From the endowment, who have prescribed the struggle against the drugs and to honors of his son out of the first marriage, who died of Überdosis, founded until hin home-baked to the own mark and organic products. 
The whole is a present for the country, in who he costed him many trouble of, himself against a mortal diet cultivation to impose. 
A great wave of the amazement and to take offers huge nationality over Hollywood without consideration on nationalities nationality. 
The last James Bond, the Englishman of Daniel Craig,, that a man have not only died certified, only the whole era. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Academy Award prizewinner, said that the work was his career with Newman no longer or not fewer as the head. 
Russell Crowe, the nasty boy, who got out of Australia, dared, Newman as his tall inspiration to qualify. 
Perhaps to live the tall all a from few, who today to confide attempts as Paul Newman lived from we abandoned', George Clooney confirmed,: High requirements at the Rechtschaffenheit get, a responsible private life, from who cameras went vaguely. 
That is not or not even always simply possible in present media jungle. 
However there have someone, who he tries, and Paul Newman in contrast an example. 
He gave up to dissolve a time and fifty years were then married with Joanne Woodward, who he was faithful, although safely he many it did not handle to being possibilities. 
wozu shall me an hamburger on the street, if me homes Filet?', he often even joked. 
In sky he gets proud of it, that is not absolutely his girl the same advice how his fan has, what on the land in America customary. 
From all tall roles, who he comes into play, on no how he was thus proud who and the faithful marriage spouse, the liking father, the attentive grandfather the the Philanthropen', legends they. 
For the Olympic games the streets in Madrid are faulty. 
Yes, the dream of many from we, some Olympic disciplines in to organise Madrid, after the failure for 2012 thus perhaps he 2016 his. 
However I question me: Are we in contrast prepared?' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that he not ballots! 
They were described as perfect street, and, my evaluation after she was the bad street with all around and dran, who there were. 
Naturally that an amount nonsense, if and one the evaluation beachten dignity me he prüfen, had clearly not come. 
Though, we ab initio cross all. 
The nonsense begins with the Ticketholen, that you permissible, to go as first. 
Does no longer seem me to bad to be, however if already to advance let, then they shall also give you all she you (inclusively flea, to avoid trafficjam on the street). 
Well yes not. 
Here they let only the Ticket( infinite after someone Warteschlange) there the surprise! The T-shirt gave he S'only in the size (a second nonsense, because I need the size XL) 
Where do we thus as a matter of fact live? 
Or is there thus, that got after the crisis resolute only small, much inexpensive shirts out of few to buy material? 
Well well, matters like this one a gewgaw in comparison to the days on the street. 
And, moreover, one must find the backpack except it, that one must much early give up up, around the flea to catch up, there already someone Warteschlange from at least 15 minutes. 
The wait have more lasted as 35 minutes, what a street, where 11 000 men wait in fall, incomprehensible. 
In the end, like he also to wait, the street started off and we not to be let, even if there were once successful our jolt bag in front of but to bring back her already difficult,. 
Moreover he shook, in these active 40 minutes wait after out of, so that it came to the temptation, an people uprising to hold up the häuschen. 
I believe, tomorrow some 500 men have safely pneumonia and some as me because of this flea, who I have gotten, not even timely by the classification appear, I can already think me, that the exit was labelled wrong. 
Naturally, if one wonder after a perfect street, this street never dawn me. 
So I believe, we still long gets rid träumen, who prepare well for the Olympic games from a town 
Microsoft on the research after a( potential) Rezeptionistin 
On the Emerging Technology Conference', organises from MIT, had Microsoft the progress of the new picture identification system and of the man interaction, a being of the artificial intelligence without many intelligence while capable is, some primitive tasks to terminate, as a taxi bestellen( or in fall from Microsoft that is a route planner, in order move move on the campus of the enterprise) to example. The system respects, what what he hears during the entertainment. 
Thank a camera and someone form -- and face identification system, this one Rezeptionistin'this one, many persons in space many, who how they are and even to remember, they occupy merchandise, he can and understand zuhören the keywords of their entertainment. 
He can also rank the present after the talks in the groups. 
In presentation video notice the Rezeptionistin' a third person, but she understands, that this person to the group, who talk guides with she.

Whole without the blue Screenshot 
Impressive 
That is safely the future. 
Now the enterprise good matters, cannot he, to example their operating system of Windows on the next version. 
This week one spoke up very superficial over the strategy change from Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be fast and not integrated according to many programmes. 
Steve Ballmer noticed, that to stuff commercial if been the computers with the necessary, instead of she with that filth, so they fünfmal got fast work. Man, Steven, that will be yes only for the Wenigen. 
All only an observation, if one thinks that someone or other inserted Microsoft versions function and of treat'in Windows. 
The change is worth 
The Microsoft exactly right like the software, the operating system loses gradually meaning,. 
Als Google chromium in net appeared, that was a part of the theory, that there are the first step from Google, in order compare compare to Windows. 
Skilfully a lot indicated it, that no operating system is the browser. 
The operating system, when an indispensable part, will be always necessary, in order can simultaneously work hardware and of software. 
The operating system fulfils the function, who are cannot otherwise his spouse his marriage husband with the function, if he darum gone by to inform his mother in law of something. 
That ballots. 
The system will never vanish, but one must at his death', not than an absolute, separate as relative truth, think. 
What Ballmer this week said, the confirmation this idea. 
The men offer the operating system to each time of few attention, in contrast more the web browser. 
The computer are only been, in order and the Firefox, who or chromium to carry Explorer out by or chromium each day verbringen we more time at surfing, when the windows'in the surroundings. 
Existing wofür the half serves in computer application? 
Fewer is more 
And Windows 7 compact. 
Light, not thus exaggerated, less intricate. 
The interest from Microsofts more consists in inside, his online service his, who then in the end the alternative to Google to know. 
In the reality they need that, without doubts. I bring a small example in contrast. 
The photo from this place me in speech moon, in a the recovery space for Microsoft employee at beginning of the month made. 
On that a shield is refreshment drink automaton tie up: Your research. Our future'. He prints a prayer out of, to use own tool for online research. 
In year of 2006 an independent study to the end came, that the 66% the employees by Microsoft, Google for the researches in net take hold. 
Moreover, last week also, that slowdown have fallen the new version of the Windows Mobile of 7 in certify. 
She does not in the beginning get, only end of 2009 appears, rather even 2010 
Microsoft the possibility possibility, simultaneously to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile to 7 on the Mark. 
Each day the telephone turns to a computers. 
The Android and what iPhon already on the market, however the other slowdown gets money expenses.

The stress is the nasty of the 21. century. 
However there not an and not two ways way, around the daily exhaustion and the problems, as one disconnects from the work world, to fight. 
The number however increases, fewer no longer and not when until 1001 at.

In sleep to talk 
Some children speak up overnight 
I do not mean this, who do and wake we up in addition to to tell something, what at day in front of to happen, the children separate, who during the sleep do speak up. 
If it happens to you to first time, in good fall been you that no meaning. 
That is a positive sleep turmoil, who the sprechen gets in sleep mentioned. 
They relatively been, above all by the children and of adolescents. 
Safely, told more as a from you that you have spoken up up overnight. 
This phenomenon occasionally attitudes( a time in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (, close each day, a time per week, a time in month) at day the child can remind himself nothing. 
There have no single reason, who this phenomenon causes. 
Often been links with other phenomena in sleep, like nightmares, panische fear overnight, of Enuresis noctura (bed ooze overnight), speak up in sleep looked, however there in contrast brings no reason. 
, As we have already early mentioned him he knows at very high Fiber, stress situation or overwork deckchair. 
Anyway, that is little studied phenomenon. 
The frequency, with who he emerges, is very variable. 
He can be, that quietly one in single words pronounces, whisper or he knows all an opposite his( cries, wines, long discussions). 
In the falls, if the statement very intense, recommended, what to watch child and beraten to give up himself by a specialist, in order verify verify, whether a, what problem exists fear and completely causes on this way come. 
We have said that there are a positive turmoil, then it is not called, there is, she is associations, who treats development knowhow with an other sleep turmoil (to example, otherwise Schlaf-Apnoe with the stress). 
What one can continue, a series from easy prevention measures achieves: 
The child before the schlafen not to tries arouse. 
Well, quiet game for the child looks and stressige fernsehprogramme avoid, who and a little terribly too savage. 
By the nervous children, who, cannot relaxations of relaxation methods enforced, in order to help them to get a certain interior calm. 
That helps quietly the child to sleep. 
If the sprechen once meets in sleep, to keep the calms try. 
Think about, that there are for the child insignificant and at next day he erinnern knowhow, what have happened at nothing. 
Useable councils 
Do not wake him up. 
That is useless, thus the child is unconscious, so you tear him out of the sleep. 
Although the child speaks up, he sleeps, then he rests. 
Think about, if he shows verängstigt a pair phenomenon himself after, so recommended, himself deliberate or discover, what what reason does child have for the fear. 
If they understand, what it says (what is not thus usual), do not pressure the child, in order to recover more information. 
So you get if in order cannot nothing, because the child sleeps, there is and unconscious above not reflections know. 
Moreover, will hear you, what it says, but what you do not get learnings, he the say, that's why they cautious with the interpretation the information and the ends, who her daraus leave. 
Perhaps, he does not tell the child that that hears she overnight and his secret knows. 
Not even as joke. 
That causes many fear. 
Well, continue no worries, there is nothing bad, that is a time, who only lasts few minute.

Interview -- of blood, that again certainly got 
Hema-Quebec yesterday celebrated the 10. year day of their foundation, and their president, Dr Francine Décary, to delight all reason himself, then Hema-Quebec are to a the sure and efficient blood banks of the world. 
And above all wiedergewonnen they the confidence the public turns upside down. 
How one knows, the managing of national blood reserves during the 1980er year with the HI-Virus and what does hepatitis C virus contaminate. 
Against this drama and of the dissatisfaction of the public the government of Canada managed a public in Feb of 1994, through the judge Horace Krever inquiry drove a, who to goal, to bring light in the circumstances, the to a such tragedy led, to work out and directives, around a renewed disaster of this to prevent way. 
While judge Krever was still nervous, to put back his report, several provinces then imagined a committee on the legs, what there were goal, a new system to administration from blood preserves in Canada to elaborate. 
In Quebec the committee Gélineau fulfilled this mission. 
After the reports from Gélineau and Krever two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who around what is concerned about Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, and to handle others provinces the two territories. 
1998, when Hema-Quebec have taken her work hardly 38% the people confidences in the blood preserve system in Quebec, remind himself Dr Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
Through the huge efforts in order the security of the blood preserves improve improve and through the work on this area during the consecutive years, we have regained the confidence of the public', say her, before she stresses proud, that confidences in Hema-Quebec meanwhile had beginning of 2008 almost 94% the populations of Quebecs. 
Dr Décary keeps however in conscience, that a little confidences extremely fragile '. 
Since their foundation at 28. Sep of 1998 bring the caution to Hema-Quebec after the principle. 
To this time we attended the attitude of numerous falls of the human form of the beef insanity in Europe of, a new way of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Krankheit, tell this woman, who the direction holds since the foundation of 1998. 
And we not the minimal idea whether this disease to translate over the blood. 
Then we appointed a the main directive of the reports from Krever and Gélineau, who in conformity with one exclusion measures enforce, if one not knows this and if a disease advances only slowly, as visibly he the fall by the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Krankheit, who express through a Degeneration of the brain, what leads inevitably to death. 
Then one accepted no blood from persons in Apr of 1999, who himself since 1980 long when a month had held in U.K. 
Now, before some years proven doubts without everything that this disease is translated over the blood. 
So this one have shown event, that the principle the caution, what we enforced, absolutely a sense. 
1999 a much exact technique to identification from HIV appeared on the market: Who directly Nukleinsäure-Tests( NST), to who to allow him, the donor the deposit the in blood to prove virus of himself, and not what who antibodies virus, he by against that who the fall was up to now using tests. 
The NST allowed him, to shorten the Inkubationszeit, the between the moment, the person dispense and who, if am proven the first viruses through our technique in blood, take place, explain the specialist. 
This time cannot be reduced to in the end by few. 
So the risk, that were dispensed certain donors, without he to know, and one this not recognise, decreased important. 
These improvements allowed AIDS over a blood bloodtransfusion to to him, the risk, translate, in considerable measure to drop. 
Today a from 12 million persons danger danger, to get dispense blood with HIV. 
With other words that means, that mustn't mustn't one 12 million blood preserves, before someone were contaminated with HIV. 
, Since Hema-Quebec shares each year between 400.000 and of 500.000 blood preserves he got many when 24 years last, before appearance, by who HIV translates over a blood preserve got a fall. 
I believe that one can today feel well in addition to, if one gets a blood bloodtransfusion or prescribe, in order the health restore restore', mean the management leader from Hema-Quebec. 
Our challenge for the close of ten years he get. 
One does never know, what krankheitserreger can reach in system. 
Only how in past year the Chikungunya-Virus have emerged on the island Réunion, what, likewise the Westnil-Virus metaphorical. 
We fort überwachen', doctor goes. Décary non-stop, before she stresses, that Hema-Quebec moreover puts a be sufficient supply on next to a sure supply to arrangement. 
The need increases, because the population ages. 
, Since the treatments to cancer struggle are aggressive the patients often need new red globules or Blutplättchen. 
To what the ageing of the population also thwarts himself end, only 3% the in average on the blood donor net to blood gifts of suitable inhabitants of Quebecs belong. ' 
In addition to each healthy man of, the 18 year or old is and the qualification criteria fulfill, all 56 tage, well six times in year, bloods give. 
In average 14% the persons, who her blood to put on to arrangement, not adoptive, because for example they at AIDS or malaria erkrankt, and who been in a country, in the malaria spreads is, blood gifts for an year of excluded. 
With these 3% we delete him, a to get inventory, what the needs of the hospitals correspond. 
Deficient stocks are very rare. 
But one must mustn't the members of this donor net, if get old she and no blood of more gifts.

, Although they were frequently mentioned in the last time in the speeches of the primeminister the opening the north -- what northern area sten on the 49 latitude -- still never topic of a presentation. 
Why the primeminister limited however it to declare a gem is the north with huge potential', no date, no investment sum or exact priority for the future project. however called 
At most some views on the, what were more worked: Above all at the water energy, at forest, but particularly at mountain building sector, and favour the renewal of the public infrastructures through the growth of the threshold countries.

This area twice thus tall as France'is nearby, is in Quebec. 
There is not only nearby, there is in we', how he, in order, that to achieve a national founder dream he dependence show show distinctly. stressed 
Quebec have much pushed through his connection with the north, he stressed: The street to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebecs, the James-Bucht.

The north, 70% the areas of Quebecs, closes a inform from Labrador a, who Quebec already always required, the primeminister opposite explained the press. 
This is a traditional position, who all governments pursued. 
There are a border, at who there are no agreement since very long time, if the opportunity offers himself I again get this position on behalf of the government take', explained he. 
Moreover, with the climate transformation we must newly überdenken our sight of north', he explained and talked about the North-West passage, the because of of the eisschmelze practicable to be the whole year. 
Before this new geopolitical background the primeminister thinks that there are quite simply an obligation, to occupy this area. 
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit? 
The primeminister said that the government of Quebecs much give up up careful with they, and that they profit from this project, above all the boy. 
Two former ministers from unlike parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau( former pekistischer deputies from Ungava) have already undertaken consultations by about thirty communities. 
A managing from Benoît Ministerkomitee, in who Julie Boulet( transport and of floor treasure) takes an important place, have taken the works. 
The primeminister does not exclude a tall gathering, not absolute a top', however an opportunity, by who one himself will delete a common sight'. 
The development of the north will go vonstatten in remaining in agreement with the principles of the lasting development. 
Who north gets plan consulted, settled and environment sweet'to be, he promised. 
Jean Charest described this sight', as if she is a continuation of who of the liberal prime ministers, who were before he in. 
Like the liberals, was before we in, had we, around the challenges in new growth-- to change and Entwicklungschanchen. 
This moreover a the always again brought up topics the weekend, the 50. birthday the resumption the parteiführung at Friday with a tall cocktail party to fête through Jean Lesage open. 
A the accepts decisions sense, to rename the powerstation from Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm. 
From Godbout, who to create Hydro-Quebec of, over Lesage, who and the silent revolution the nationalization the water electricity accomplished, to Bourassa, who have had the James-Bucht, our party always known, the future too explaining Jean Charest. 
The press compared with he setting on an other, this time conservative plan dust-sheet, and indeed on what the to programme roads North'from John Diefenbaker

That is on top of that be', he trusted his party member at, under we, however me have, what applause storms provoked by this one. 
The prime ministers, who have said in Apr, that it is also 2009 no elections 2008 and safely, the possibility in the act, this autumn an election a, what he of law her possible, still not excluded. 
He stresses that his diary is however full, above all because of a mission of the community council in China and of a top between Quebec and New York. 
The general assembly of weekend provided the liberal leader with a platform out of nationalist plans, above all end concern goal', who were accepted ohne weiteres: The PLQ all particularly calls for the gratefulness of the feature of Quebecs'in the constitution. 
She also liked, that Quebec members the council the Canadian radio and of telecommunications appoint, and that this one a veto the took in Quebec decisions besitzen relative. 
The guidelines were taken the plan north with scepticism by sides of the opposition. 
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, the policy to development of the Nord-du-Quebec again the have, who the government Landry have introduced 2001. 
According to she the liberal government, when she came 2003 at the power, it give up, to enforce this one. 
If he had made them, we were today already many large', Mrs Marois judged at the side of their candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election today take place) Françoise Mercure.

Letter -- a disgracing country 
Sir Vic Toews, ex-'justice'- of minister( what irony) in cabinet Harper there was, who himself last summers authorized, over Louise Arbour say, she is a shame 'for Canada. 
This woman, who a liking struggle for the justice led and universe our admiration our have, thus with shame to roof, say likewise many over the person in order around the primeminister out of, as even over Stephen Parker. 
We here to make, who not at home he all the affected countries her caught in concentration camp compatriot with a government as single end caught up. 
A government, who not even take into account, that an adolescent was still Omar Khadr, as the things dispensed, who be to reproach to him. 
The single government, who signs in spite of the fact, that Canada the genfer convention, her word child soldier under inhuman conditions and breaks dahinvegetieren someone let. 
The single, what himself to a justice parody, to evaluate around the mistake of the defendant does stoop. 
We call us in memory, that UNICEF above all in contrast pleads, Amnesty International and who unification of the Canadian lawyers, at home Omar Khadr to catch up, in order he gets a fair lawsuit in Canada. 
Exactly this government also closes the eyes before the torture: He little interests them, that have will broken safely an young adult the torment after thus many years for always moral. 
We we we what still not knowingly, but we here live just now a treacherous circumcision of our law, our freedom and of our democracy', this word, what continuously Harper like a flag before himself her, and that out of his mouth thus trivial ring instruct. 
He then been the time, in who there are more no moral: One a Canadian bourgeois arbitrarily a,, all after Gutdünken of an head of government, who only from the minority am supported until today( he likes all belong after that of 14. October to minority...) by the minority. 
Many electors believe to find her salvation by a party, the virtue. However they do not see that this government have dissociated from that, what the dignity of our country and continued the reputation. 
Who and nowhere differently shame, sir Toews, finds Lossagung in this one,. 
Free opinion -- the orwellsche speech from Barrick gold 
In their expense of 17. Sep Le Devoir published a letter from sir Patrick Garver, Vize-Generaldirektor of the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. 
This one certifies, and someone on top of that pursues orwellsche logic, that small destitute house house and bids the tall gold extraction society of the world a libel complaint over six million against three authors for someone, with that aim, a public transparent debate'to open. 
That if he ballots, the judges are independent and unprejudiced, then they do not over the truth, above all not in fall from libel complaints, only over the law appreciate. 
How erwartet, was this fundamental difference hushed absolutely up by sir Garver. 
Thus for Barrick gold to guide a public debate of, everybody to drift of, the the good way in the ruins he dares, a the her to replace contrary opinion. 
All at once, like the lawsuit suppose, what and authors the editor the book Noir Canada development considerable sums ausgeben duty, around her defense prepare and with very irregular weapons against a armed forces from lawyers fight, the out of the almost inexhaustible bags the gold mine pays. 
The tactic by these irregular struggles often in remaining, who the opposing party continues mundtot of and moreover each put off of, the he dares, himself again with the question to handle. 
, If Barrick liked gold really a public debate they her visibility the things präsentieren duty before the public public opinion. 
In contrast with it, what in many the countries, Barrick gold work, speed and gave, debates are normally adjusted in Canada through the swap from ideas and not through bludgeon blows. 
He then had, if and had offengelegt the gold mine her book and of files a real debate open, independent through the journals, media, publications and the financing Prüfteams, who had sparse in this question bringen. 
Though Barrick gold seem no confidence in the public public opinion and aloof wipe the petitions and of letters to support of the authors from Noir Canada with an Handbewegung. 
Cannot perhaps sir Garver declare, simultaneously cannot he debate around a public'and in addition to yes who rightly opinions this public missachten? 
Apparently this word in the world of the vice president consists of only the generous paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; Someone all beautiful beengte visibility wise of the term. 
In a democracy even slanderers the right to speak up. 
What gold not understands Barrick-- or not understand-- is, that the public, who and the authors editor from Noir Canada supports, this above all therefore make, because the brutal position of the gold mine refuses them. 
This public and to appreciate, however on the foundation of a civilise swap from arguments it prepare to listen to Barrick, and not in someone to frame, who a lot notice as gag complaint (in course of the public debate'a claim just now addressed Barrick gold at the authors from Noir Canada, in who they require from them, this term no longer use...). 
Except from the surrealen speech from sir Garver, the complaint gold a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the wahrheitsfindung, who are fundamentally for each democratic society from Barrick. 
She absolutely the right right, to quote and to discuss, who credibly sources over facts and of interpretations the basis the intellectual work bilden. 
If impossible impossible Canada in a country there, topics, who not the rich enterprises this world favours, who knows otherwise the then make? 
, If Barrick liked gold really a public and transparent debate cannot cannot she this one, while she succeeds the scientific standards, who use from the authors from Noir Canada. 
She has a right to reply. 
The academic environment, to who we belong to, for years knows, and to get and to solve conflicts debates disagreements in the grip. 
The disproportionate complaint from Barrick gold show distinctly, that no desire for a transparent debate has them, in contrast with that, what she pleads,. 
How this a loss for the university world, likewise for the public debate, and he gets rid time a, that the governments measures the, who this way of unjustified complaints to restrict.

Paul Newman( 19252008) -- death of a committed icon 
His beauty with the azurblauen eyes long time his asset, nobody say, his weakness. 
The American actor had rid himself with the charming smile of narcissistic mirror? 
Yes and nay. 
His delicacy, his sensitivity and an obvious talent he well likewise from a power he have, who the really appalling monsters brought to world. 
But what for a tall duration runners! 
The old in at Friday from 83 years at the consequences from lung cancer on his Ranch in Connecticut dying Paul Newman have left a the last icon of the American cinema who he gilded years. 
Fewer fewer monumental when and Brando, what he looked for the he is sufficient for a way rival on the screen was, careful, fragile in his spectacle in addition to also check, but likewise an apostle of the freedom and of the sprengens of dramaturgischer convention. 
Blend blood often produces wonderful children. 
He and 1925 a German Jew a Hungarian stocky mother in Ohio as son born. 
Out of his European root a the glorious face the American dream origin. 
Without excessive Ego, outside quality feature. 
Thus in he a whole country reflected himself again, that in the Self-made-man infatuated, in the combatant, the in Pazifik war in fight injures, the beginning of the 50er years spectacle art in Yale the Actor'and then studied s studio in N.Y pays visit, before he success at theater, in television and soon also in cinema. 
Rightly this man, who fought for the citizenships, also the driver of, the 1979 by 24 hour run from one second got, and moreover a sex symbol, although he lived together Vorzeigebeziehung with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in someone. 
With he also vanish who unknown facets this one mysterious, reserved, committed and gegenüber the prestige the show business of over-sensitive stars, what one will never completely solve mysteries. 
A suitable man, in pure sense of the word. 
The death Paul Newmans putting the cinema lovers this weekend in vertigo, while the memories all his tall role on the dark screen played. 
More as an half century of American film art in permanent change ahead leave with he. 
There the charming cowboy again imposes end" Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid "(1969) in memory, and the young man, who sheet metal roof refuses his sensual wife( Elizabeth Taylor) in the cat on the warm of, the 1958 from tenne lake of Williams verfilmt. 
He someone go up memory( 1990) much short to wachgerufen, who all not fulfilled her promise at his sensitive sir of bridge, who gets in his high age from a marriage disrupted, who. 
According to a lot other there were in run of the history Paul Newmans. 
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable pugilist Rocky Graziano out of Somebody Up There Likes Me (an hand voll dirt) from Robert Wise, a role, the for James Dean thought, after what again been death and the Newman 1956 aright known continued. 
This likeable Ganove topping in The Sting( the Clou), the 1973 with the Oskar for the good film excellent got. 
When bitter and vindictive billiard player wonderful The Hustler horses( 1961) in from Robert, 
This face through the times hindurch, what was he. 
Always still he. 
In his curriculum vitae times unite. 
The youth knows him above all out of the worship film Slap Shot from George Roy Hill( 1977), when Reggie Dunlop, who few orthodox coach a hockey team. 
His fan again found it 1994 Proxy of the brothers Coen in The Hudsucker. 
With a last role of 2003 when to godfather of the Irish Mafia Perdition castle himself the circle in road from Sam Mendes. 
In contrast with several cinema legends, who early withdrawn enough out of the film world, long shall Newman in saddle, and on top of that Hollywood, his fortune, his splendour and his concession betray. 
The French film-maker Bertrand Tavernier looked at him,,, judging not without humour as living challenge at the Underplaying'as he. 
The job Paul Newman not always light for the beautiful. 
He communicated however rare Sunnyboys as outsiders: Neurotic, alcoholic, Fieslinge or desperate person, and perfect representation he his abgleiten his rebellion reflected. 
Als unveiling Newman unknown sides of his true sensitive sensitivity. 
Being Rachel, Rachel from 1968( after the novel of the kanadierin Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the star part, marked a distinguished shrewd woman portrait of full melancholy. 
He, who his son Scott through a Überdosis lost a work full, Son dedicated and this 1984 to his film Harry, delicacy and of sadness. 
, By the tide from tributes, who yesterday flung over Newman his narrow friend and early weapon companion of Robert Redford( they had trifled the and together kid in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy with Sundance) declared extremely touched: His presence have improved my life and this country. ' 
Important features of the dying actor were generosity and of life joy. 
Except from his legendary career a tall defender of the citizenships, the environmental protection and of the independent cinema now also leaves, a rival of the Abdriften Hollywoods, dahin. 
We often well he Vinaigrette with the foot in skins full, in sauces, gebäck or of other foods to declare see, and this for relatively insipid salaries, although we in the beginning found it we still amusing. 
The profits out of his sales revenue however flowed in his endowment for children in distress. 
Instead of rest rest on his myth, Newman committed until to gunshot. 
He left his five girls a letter with these sentences: Always and until all to the end your father were grateful incredibly for his good star. 
There was an honor, here be. ' 
And for we there was an honor, the life of a thus intelligent and generous American actor pursue.

Who equally momentary in Liquidation situated Biogate Kft. also and Co with supplement. teamed up: In year of 2003 the GmbH the endowment Jöv pegs ért away Alapítvány, as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny Egyesület million with gefälschten bills in total value from clog of 5. handled, who himself on not provided performances reported. 
There however gave likewise few payment traffic, since the bills were canceled directly after their exhibition, what the affected however forgotten in her support mark down. 
Who the third group of the Rechnungsleger consists of persons, be to bring directly with the defendants in connection. 
A from they Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian manager of the delta Trió Kft., an in Budapest established, there however not auffindbaren fuel-- and vehicle business enterprise. 
This enterprise shall about rescued 18 million in period of time until Dec of 2005 from several bills over the sale from EDV-Komponenten in value from clog. 
According to survey authority the situated since the 14. Sep of 2005 in Liquidation Cash investment Kft. out of Kiskunhalas when buyers of these bills have acted. 
A Romanian, what shall equally the enterprise documents from Iván Kubatov, between 2002 was and 2005 managers of this enterprise 
After our information had Kubatov during the surveys of, bills on behalf of the GmbH. at the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány at Együtt shown and who equivalent even cashed. 
The enterprises Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as the Jos-Investment Bt. shall founded be from Romanian builder on Iván Kubatovs formal desire. 
In however no this enterprise was actively, what was according to defendant at deficient missions. 
However he cannot profit from the enterprises: On request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who charge with the preparation of the enterprise foundation supports, he shown bills on behalf of the enterprises at the brought with supplement in connection associations, as about at Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
Over all Kubatov 15 bills the enterprises Cash investment, delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos in total value from clog of 14,2 million in name, Jos investment and of Linaxtrade at the organisations shown. 
The public prosecutor leaves from it for, that cash each time Kubatov 10% the bill sums as well as the value-added tax. 
Kubatov even the enterprise Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of imaginary bills abuse credit -- in this fall the bills the applications from Biztos Pont joined. 
Who a enterprise Y-Generáció and Szövetség rot Magyarországért in Jan of 2006 her application by the gemeinnützigen organisation of the socialist party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (" TMA") put back. 
Both got Forint, these amounts have however profited zweckentfremdet. per 500.000 
Around this to hide, they the TMA five imaginary bills the Works team Kft. subjected. 
These bills moreover the office by the durchsuchung from Árpád Kemecsei in teaching ministry provided. 
By the negotiations now the bill forgery, they were already withdrawn before the public prosecutor from some defendants with an admission over the procedure, reckoned. 
A sensation cannot cannot, if the Hauptangeklagte János supplement resolves to a detailed admission. 
His former indication was namely fewer detailed, and although he had already time and again recited, consisting over all to bring back, still support his admission. 
The question then stays open, whether this in his interest in, whether the socialists a pact the bulk the born damage with he concerning the mending from clog of 50 million. closed, and whether supplement in riposte ready, who responsibility to assume. 
However possible possible absolutely, that supplement now trifles with the" offended", after his request the imprisonment and house stop on softening on deaf ears wheeled. 
While other Kriminelle, who far away tall damage with economy crimes caused and this not paid, on free foot, or at least under house stop stay, this possibility have left supplement verwehrt. 
The psychology of the überbietens -- or we ready 
By auctions the buyers tilt it, more spend and to overestimate the Feilgebotene therefore. 
Neurologist and economy researcher of the university from N.Y there now succeeded, and apparently to discover the neurologisch-ökonomischen foundations this acquaintance irrational behavior. 
According to a publishing in" Science" study himself the men in a competition, about an auction on not knocked eBay, give and therefore ready, even prices to überhöhte pay. 
The researchers have tried to acknowledge the neurologische diagram of this" game" with experimental auctions. 
A group of the volunteers shall shall lotto, while the other participated in a playful action-- in two falls the active brain areas of the pro bands were examined by means of functional magnetic repercussion( fMRI). 
By two games cannot the participants money, however an increasing activity the Striatum sised, by who a comes the überbieten of the rival into play. 
Next to many other functions this brain area the nervous system for the" Selbstbelohnung" responsible. 
The researchers from then on meant, the price increase explain left an Überreaktion of the Striatums with himself through the prevention. 
Around her thesis to support, the economists inquiries the money in the researcher group additional to Nachverfolgung hired. 
In this fall shall mitbieten three groups against a partner under distinct conditions. 
The test group the true value the product informed, then they have made her commitment. 
Promised 15 dollar reward over hinaus an other group, for the fall, that they result as winner from the game. 
The third group got 15 dollar before the auction, who equally a lost game in fall lost. 
The difference between two groups then consisted in exclusively inside, that the accentuation by who an on the gewinnen, while found by the other on that loss. 
As proof of who from neurologists of expressing hypothesis however the members the spielenden" against the loss" group too high commitments ready, when this one the" profit"- in the Kontroll-- respectively. group. 
"These results give up from no early economy theory to evacuate. 
This one namely up to now the watching by auctions behaviour ways the risk prevention only with the joy over the gewinnen, respectively. found. 
The contradiction between these two theories been thanks to the bildgebenden neurologischen processes, so that now have we a third explanation ready"-- Andrew meant ballast, professor of the economy faculty of the university from N.Y. 
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to consult? 
World-wide men under chronic hepatitis B or of C tolerate about an half billion, and in Hungary this chronic liver illness under the distinguished todesursachen. 
The number of the Infizierten here on hunderttausend what estimated, development however treats only seven thousand, finds daran, that often not the patients learnings, that they dispensed. 
Hepatitis is the sammelbegriff for trigger through unlike viruses, infectious liver illnesses. 
The symptoms are often similar -- hepatitis and of jaundice frequently, however differ the agents and the diseases voneinander. 
According to agents the hepatitis viruses on two unlike ways spread: By hepatitis A and E through the Verdauungstrakt( to example through polluting foods or water), by hepatitis B, C and of D the viruses through bloods and other body liquids (, vagina sekret like about sperm or saliva) translated. 
At any rate recommended a vaccination A and of B against the viruses to travelers, against the virus there gives C no vaccine. 
The symptoms by hepatitis A appear about zwei-drei weeks after consumption of the polluting food and in general from Unwohlbefinden, weakness, stomach pain and nausea accompany. 
Dark, and who then thrust the jaundice on the skin and in the eyes, the chair gets hell, the urine recovery does know until to zwei-drei weeks last long. 
World-wide about 1 million man yearly dies of the trigger from hepatitis, intensify heavy illnesses like liver cancer and of liver cirrhosis. 
Main reason hierfür is, that only each tithe Infizierte is projections in conformity with in medikamentöser treatment. 
Also hepatitis C can have grave consequences: unbehandelt he can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
The many Infizierten are in the knows not even over her illness, since the agent destroys slyly the liver cells-- in many falls symptoms after 20-30 years show himself to the first. 
How from then on timely vorbeugen, is about regular test inquiries, essential. 
In who there gives three groups, this illness frequent come: Those, who submitted before 1991 a blood blood transfusions, Drogenabhängige, and Tätowierte. 
Currently the number who C Erkrankten at chronic hepatitis world-wide on 200 million estimated. 
Unknown since the disease already by an usual laboratory inquiry is manifest, there is timely, by the first signs root to consult the family-doctor. 
In time recognised, the disease the infection danger curable wodurch, the virus can be exterminated, bewitched and who genesis gets from cancer vorgebeugt. 
The 30. Sep the world day from hepatitis of, 2004 to first time from patient representations organised world-wide. 
He, the conscience for this causing from viruses chronic hepatitis, her genesis and the meaning of the screening to forces are goal of the action. 
Have believers pains fewer? 
That as new research results justify, already relieved the religious belief as a way achieves" analgesics", that the death martyrs catholic. 
Scientists of the Oxford university have achieved an interesting experience: How he was examined, the belief at god the Schmerzempfinden the man influence, that announced British leaf" Telegraph". 
In train of the rather weird inquiry did ever keep 12 believers and of atheists of Elektroschocks up, while they a painting the mother god studied. 
How the results showed, the believers cannot cast. 
By means of an Hirn-Scan technology even proven, that the Catholics cannot activate the part of their brain, who is concerned about the pain regulation. 
The inquiry the first in a research project, also and philosophers theologians from unlike departments the university next to scientists participate. 
By attempt the pro bands a sparkling appliance at tied, what the Elektroschocks putting back. 
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two paintings: To a a picture of the mother god, painted from Sassoferrato in 17. century, and to other Leonardo since Vincis" lady with the ermine". 
The researchers hoped, that be the sight of the virgin of Maria a way religious trance under the believers, while they there chose Vincis picture, because he hardly differed paintings of other and when were felt soothing. 
The attempt persons did ever pass an half hour to a MRI scanner, and Elektroschocks kept up in this time of over all 20 in four stages, while they either the religious, or the other painting look. 
The Catholics reported, she himself the mother god" by sight in security" felt, as if they "umsorgt", and they and calms peace"" felt. 
During the betrachtens of the religious painting had they over 12% few pains, as if they had Leonardos works before eyes. 
Who psychologist Miguel Farias participated, meant, one, achieves strongly also with other pictures also by who do atheists provoke, one mustn't only the corresponding photo finds. 
"We a picture a, what how very positive sensations trigger, about a mother or a father", thus who psychologist. 
The Anglican bishop of Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
"The praktizieren of the glaubens shall shall our personality, and he also makes falls in many", according to Wright. 
After these outstanding results only still stay the question, what effect a Madonna picture of Leonardos or of an other comparable painter on the pain regulation of the believers. 
Do the qualitative high-grade virgin Maria get still good results? 
You are, what you inform over you 
On the occasion of their tenth birthday Google with Fug and law asserts: How she is in the bags of the men likewise to find, over her head at sky: Where she knows had the men her holiday. 
And in order Eric Schmidt always still not enough, great. 
In direction sceptic, who horror sights be to torment by Orwellschen, he obtain lets: This one did get rightly the important of the web of 2.0 übersehen. 
financial in an interview with that times Schmidt recently meant, the main goal from Google he, still more personal information over users according to the original objective the close enterprises to come, wonach they" all information this world ordnen "like. 
Schmidt declared, Google always still only weltverändernder work the Informations-Sammelns after ten years at beginning. 
Asked after the status Schmidt meant Quo in five years: He wanted, Google in the situation or, to wonder" how I shall tomorrow make?"" what job do really suit to me?" to reply, however still not software programmes it in the situation, since they not knew enough over the users. 
Not from who all internet user is himself over in clear, that the research terms were noted in train of their internet research, also the IP-Adressen, were been end, and who paid visit sides by. 
For example the introducing before two years" Personalized Search" and later on allows the visitor to his own research course to memories it to resort, so that am later on generated the strokes many precise, and on the same logic the thus so-called" Recommendations also rest ", with who preferences and because of of the early recommend the system maßgeschneiderte products provisions of services. 
Who however user questions himself, what in fall of an datum abuse happen --" if nachschaut one, what I make"-- many prove worrier above the Google-Datenmonopols. 
In the many falls there is however rather the represent from the enterprise, potential power, the fear irritating achieves of, and few the schuldgefühl or the fear of punishment, the ambition after freedom or the Aufbegehren against the power, the by many Internet-Usern refusal strikes. 
He is however stored an established fact, that not only the research terms, also separate in reason fall at thirds spread get, and in these law falls there brings no protection for the personal laws of the internet user. 
An parade example hierfür recently the process against pedophilia in handed Google of the Brazilian government information over in train of who, who name" Orkut from the community site "gathered and also someone Identifizierung the pedophilias allowed. 
Worried about personal laws user however still aufatmen in May, when Google left successfully jointly with the citizenship organisation EFF against the FBI before court: demnach Google can be also in future pressured with no point of the constitution into it, information the FBI on request publish. 
(However successfully the union government the return from 50.000 web addresses and of 1.000 research terms that voting youth protection law under reference before years get, however you the list the single user, or who web -- and research term list on two months deprive rückwirkend.) 
Googles image then stays controversial: This one, the her personal date grudgingly publish, because they through the use of the Google-Dienste the loss she Privat -- and intimate sphere fears, who himself the enterprise with the represent conservative enterprises due indignation scourges. 
While sees the American" Geek-Kultur", who is in many countries present and enthusiastic computer fan, activist and user eint, the next generation of the "cool contractor" in they, in contrast to Microsoft, what thanks to Windows market leaders, even if both fight same around that goal. 
A possible reason hierfür is, that no Identifizierungscodes asks Google his Usern in contrast with Microsoft, and his service free to arrangement put on of, attractive so that an open, continuously updating source code and of Programm-Package far away, adolescents and cool to be seem, the official practices the software giant. 
On the other hand the Geeks twig the problematic report of the personal law and the internet sharp -- a report, what web of 2.0 in particular in the past years thanks to the term" "in the centre blown. 
By" web of 2.0" same same there around nothing other, the around Kollaboration, pronounce, user leaves intentionally trace and the available profit communication channels, and even if the extent individual distinct are, the essential stays same, namely himself public to prove. 
An average young can simultaneously manage his profile on several community portals -- from Facebook over Xanga, this one services, about Twitter by means of other, or music service as connect together last.fm, and this in the end in a Nachverfolgungssystem as about FriendFeed or Blip.fm integrates. Over hinaus can führen they Blogs, who photo galleries represent automatically the new esten, the on Flickr or Picasa geostet. 
And a line of large exemplary falls proves: By betrachten of the party photos of the past night soon find the friend heraus, with who himself her disloyal friend plays, otherwise the collaborator entlassen gets, because only too honestly he his trouble air power-- someone is sure: in his Blog over the business management Who" privatsphäre" got term meanwhile complete newly interpret. 
Who does a Online life behave, that is, what preisgibt he from himself -- thus in about one cannot formulate the reason idea behind the behavior of the present youth. 
Who and does who try to keep something secret, or good what to dodge Google-Monopol, gladly that tun -- as about with Scroogle, a tool, what indeed take on the search engine from Google, however intentionally no traces leave. 
How not few men do not also note intentionally the online applications from Google, about Textverarbeitungs on community sides, in order not auffindbar she, though -- and graphic tools of and RSS-Feeds, give up let itself with alternative versions, who Serverparks are tied up up at no gigantic and from then on no longer the bestmögliche profile of user generates. 
The public public opinion waits while bewitched it, until her true face shows Google. 
With her current value from USD of 156 billion. the enterprise even finds before IBM( USD of 140 billion.), Intel( USD of 124 billion.) or coca-cola( USD of 110 billion.), the Werbeflächen from AdWords/ sense the takings of the advertising agencies threaten, and the always fast introducing provisions of services ready not only Microsoft only also other developers, bother. 
Critical observers however also find the worrying Gegenpole: So have had about the conglomerate direction a protest of the collaborators complete, after the dues of the firmeneigenen kindergarten were doubled, moreover the management, who repeated food the collaborators to meant expensively. The whole however requires mild quite simply in contrast, that agreed with a convention was, wonach all regime critical strokes, or those, against the good taste who contravene, filtered out. 
The internal regulation of the conglomerate is, that Voraus applied no new provision of services in gets, only separate if this one is also already available. However again the events the future months and of years plain strengthen umkrempeln: While some mean, Googles book-- and Magazinscan-- respectively. Archivierungsprojekt meanwhile accepts extent, that soon himself the enterprise with the supreme court display, so other rather because of the system" Health" worries, the the establishment of a complete health profile with the help of from diagnosis, doctors and problems allow. 
And the fact, that Google a genetic database rebuilds, deliver the next generation of the Sci-Fi author to already the material -- about" Scroogled", the famous novel from Cory Doctorow describe in good orwellschen way a future, in the a man thanks to from Google reporting dates frightening close liquid. 
Two adolescents help the double murderer from Ózd by the trace elimination 
In link with the double murder from Ózd the police now two adolescents two have, who in suspicion to stay, by the elimination of the traces helped to have, the spokesman of the police commissionership Borsod at Tuesday informed.

The financial crisis of European out of the visibility journals 
In her who gets worse international dedicate comments always beyond talked plain at Tuesday distinguished European leaves already of" second of 11. Sep ". 
The global finance disaster we the American president to owe, about" La Repubblica" meant -- the president been not even in the situation, his own party for the law plan behind himself to a, who some relief to bring in the harrowing situation... 
Instead of someone" new Pearl Harbor" he called, timely timely there, from a" second of 11. Sep" to speak up. 
Parts of the press in Madrid locate equally the scapegoat in Washington. 
After view of the" El Mundo" responsible for responsible the failing political direction, that the world economy now seals at edge of the collapse. 
The American finance system always more threatens to collapse, and darunter world gets the whole suffer. 
Bushs plan was indeed not perfect, now threatens. 
Attached in the air, and indeed rightly to a moment, there a the tall change of the history of the capitalism take place. 
One can not more let the threat but eight, about the genfer" means Tages-Anzeiger". 
Still indeed cannot many states her geratenen in swaying money institute rescue packets to arrangement, and the banks with the money of the taxpayers before the bankruptcy save.

Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumble bee 
The good method new technologies to development to accident prevention, if not to imitate the obstacle detectors out of the nature? 
For example the the bees. 
By the CEATEC in Japan been a surprising project, by what the Nissan-Ingenieure new from bumble bees by the Erschaffung accident avoiding systems inspired. 
In cooperation with the Tokioter university had Nissan the staging from car robots biomimetische system of type BR23C, a mini car, endowed with the features of the bees, objective, to support, that the development a system everything crashes avoid. 
In flight each bee and forms her own, oval" private area", who our own" protection shield" are much similar, Kazuhhiro Doi told, Produktmanager research and development for Technologie-PR, by the exhibition. 
The compound eye of the bee, what can see in each direction and in an angle from over 300 degree, on top of that comes a into play. 
Around the function of the compound eye to imitate, the researchers picked the idea of the lasergesteuerten distance knife up. 
This one identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a face field from 180 degree inside from 2 meters, calculate her distance and send signals at the microprocessor at Board, who undertake at once the kollisionsvermeidenden lawsuit. 
The obstacle is been in second fractions, and who car robot changed at once by car robot who the movement the bees, while he turns the ripe around the corresponding angle. similar to courses, 
In contrast with former systems find this manoeuvre purely instinctive instead of. 
"If there were not thus, the car robot did not know quickly enough reagieren, in order the Hindernissen avoid avoid", declared Toshiyuki Andoh, ladder of the" Mobility Laboratory" and of the car robot project. 
The system must and mustn't instinctive at once, since this technology corresponds to the interior and vulnerable part of the Schutzschildes -- a layer, currently still than gelten inevitable accidents. 
The total lawsuit must mustn't the behavior of the bees, if they avoid other bees. 
And that must expire in fraction of a second. 
However the ausweichen, in contrast with the bees, can not hinauf happen or good diagonal, hinunter, -- he knows only two-dimensional. 
While here the bees many possibilities stehen, around other bees cannot, avoid himself the researchers by car robot only the drehbewegung infinite open of, or the beschleunigens and to serve Abbremsens. 
The BR23C contains Lithium-Polymerbatterien, who and light energy efficient. 
Andoh and declared fewer on the treatment of the dates, he goes back on the instinctive, intelligent reaction at, of, and still few on the aptitude, this store. 
This appliance must work exclusively some entries per second and proportionally on they react. 
He not this one memories, with the help of early maneuvers produce an intuitive, logical reaction, so that he only an handful KB Memory standard in entitlement take. 
He needs no gigabyte-- and megabyte heavy Memories. 
This the first step the immediate crash prevention technology, who to be after appraisal from Nissan inside the close of ten years serial in production in the development. 
A large application cannot the technology by the GPS-Satellitennavigation, while he thus at goal brings. 
A name for the sin expensive child 
Now the written version of the is 700 billion dollar of heavy rescue packet law before, what in several to enforce stages to be and the bad credits the banks on the repurchase aim. 
In first passage the half of the money shall be spent. 
In a session, local time coast went at Saturday after midnight to, the congress deputies after mehrtägigen debates to an agreement about that 700 billion dollar have resolved heavy rescue packet, Reuters announced. 
"We have gotten important progresses", Nancy Pelosi told, democratic president American in House of Representatives, and meant, one must only still bring the agreement to paper. 
Presidential supporting over the packet two candidates-- Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Finance ministers Henry Paulson meant to result: The programme will show effect and he gets efficient, one but still more make. According to Pelosi there did here not look rumzureißen around the rescue of the Wall Street, separate darum, at the oar of the economy. 
The written version of the packet still the Asiatic markets, well, Washingtoner time Sunday evening of 8 clocks( mitteleuropäische time Monday of 2 clocks in the morning) before the opening, publish, no altitude flight however triggered on the stock exchanges. 
At Monday first suit the House of Representatives over the law plan to stabilization of the economy from 2008, then the senate at the line. 
President George Bush talked at Saturday evening to Pelosi, and also that weisse house the news over the agreement welcomed. 
We are satisfied with the erzielten in the night progresses and the efforts of two parties estimate, our market to spokesmen of the white and stabilise our economy to skirmishers, Tony Fratto dissociated, house. 
The programme however diverges from the original recommendation of the Bush administration, wonach the 700 billion dollar on once overburdening for the repurchase lazy, with credits bonds spent. 
Where in a first tranche at the maximum the half of the 700 billion amount shall be spent, 250 billion are at once available, after abstimmen erwartungsgemäss gets the congress at Monday over the Causa. This sum kreditbelasteter for the repurchase, bad bonds spent development, large 100 billion USD quota the president decisions. 
The programme is checked by an own commission, who the president of the Federal also belongs to reserve. 
The other half of the 700 billion. depends on a large decision of the congress. 
In sense of the law the finance ministry can enforce also a matching tactic: He simultaneously cannot bad credit, mortgage, and overburdening with mortgages bond, or also other" toxic" credits. 
How competent persons of the ministry reported, not only the repurchase in an auction, but also directly happen. 
The law allows the affected enterprises to him, at a insurance programme to participate, by what the finance ministry guarantees the worrying means, and who undertake the zu erwartenden damages corresponding dues bezahlen. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means so that am put dollar on on until to 700 billion as emergency aid for the American system to arrangement, he bad for the tall angelegten repurchase means, their insurance, or who prevention a system risk, what am triggered through the collapse of a tall money institute. 
We put the necessary steps on, in order we are ready to introduction of the law, as soon as he was signed, according to Paulson. 
The leaders of the geratenen in difficulties and now dependent on national help banks however know it, that her calculate recordings, who in übersee slang lax "Golden Handshake" called, from the government shortened. 
There have only in affirmative falls a shortening of the contents, and these shortening development it depend, how the finance ministry helps each time. 
The shortening means in important, that if the ministry buys within the context of an auction, so who" Golden Handshake" imposes gets, unless, who serving bank leader gets in the pension expelled. 
In fall of a direct repurchase of the lazy credits will be aggressively the government, in order provide provide, that not the Managergehälter development exaggerated. 
To picture also belong, that the existing Golden Handshake-Verträge is not changed-- the limitations bear only on new conventions, in order men all the more more participate in programme. 
That the first fall in the American history the, that shortening are settled per law by manager contents by manager contents, the democrat Barney Frank, chairmen of the finance board, commented on the measure. 
The state regains participation law at the participate banks, so that the risk goes down for the taxpayers, since they can also participate, as soon as he the economy and in order also again better the saving bank go. 
The law plan senses, that the president the congress a proposal in the close of five years necessity, how the taxpayers shall again recover her lost money out of the finance sector subjects. 
There were however sceptics, who her doubt expressed in dust-sheet on the plan on two sides. 
That not on no account the the plan skirmisher the money the taxpayers, to expect what the American bourgeois from we,, according to the Californian republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague out of Ohio, Mary Kaptur meant: The measures were activated by same persons, who the Wall Street is also for the collapse responsible.

A price decline by the oil treatment( 1,4 percent), by Elektro -- and technical appliances( 0,9 percent), as writes down insignificant by the wood treatment( 0,1 percent). 
The prices in the paper production, as by the publishing houses and in being stayed unaltered. 
In other branches of the working industry a price rise was sised between 0,2 and of 0,9 percent.

Press show of the German-speaking space 
The right warehouse is intact, single the electors inside the warehouse assured-- so" the mirror" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria. 
In Austria am ready to regieren, to prevent rot-schwarze around someone coalition. 
The mirror( spiegel.de) 
In the online expense of the leftwards situated German news magazine Franz Walter analyzes the reasons of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavaria revolution vertilgt her Väter". 
After view of the political renowned analyst the erosion began for years the CSU before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo assumed his office. 
The Christsozialen have renewed Bavaria over decades-- now just now the modern bourgeois from they turn away. 
How the time breaking is simultaneously a problem of the Christdemokratie, also for Angela Merkel. 
All surprising the disaster of the CSU did not get away, however at Sunday have a little gone to, what however already stood out before relatively exactly ten years: The irrefutable hegemony of a state party 
, 1998 thus already before ten years the CSU lands by 47,7 percent and bended down it for first time since the fünfziger years under the fifty percent mark 
That then still repeated before three years by the bundestag elections of 2005 in the much Stoiber era quoted. 
The activate from the CSU in province consistent modernization have vertilgt her own mother and Väter to good Letzt. 
Sociologists already had that before 40 years of, himself on top of that but in tempo considerably makes mistake. Despite everything without repercussions the Säkularisierung, the formation successes, the crowd from east -- and norddeutschen in the prosperierenden areas of Bavaria on the faithfulness of the CSU electors not stay. 
Modernization always accompanies with option increase. And that has political consequences. 
The right warehouse is intact -- single the electors inside the warehouse got critical and headstrong. 
Striking is, that quite simply the classic bourgeois groups expressed the tall distance in the last weeks to CSU: The liberal professions, the professional bourgeoisie and elector with baccalaureate like university end. 
Here the support of the CSU on went down good under 40 percent as of.

Under the participants representatives from governments were, the European sozialpartnern, as well as who meant European right-wing protection-- and bourgeois organisations out of the area equal opportunity. 
As the EP-Abgeordneten announces the press office the Fidesz, Járóka have became attentive it, that next to discrimination by the job research, who Roma were supplanted in first line because of their low formation level of labourmarket. 
"The exceeding majority of the Roma-Jugendlichen no mean school formation, and thanks to a bad primary school training only a small part can reach an university end from they". 
Beyond Járóka stressed that a fundamental humanrights are formation, what a key role came of other by the Geltendmachung humanrights. 
The economy of the EU member states can fortify investments in the precocious training from Roma-Kindern. 
After view of the deputy important important there, that himself these links an if possible great circle -- well Roma and nicht-Roma -- aware get. 
Thus per early a Roma pupil the school begins, all the more crates his chance, to productive member of the labourmarket to become; strong And through income-- and revenue dearly they carry their contribution to the national expenses out. 
"As union bourgeois, must be mustn't the Roma the right to qualitative high-grade formation-- the bad and segregierte teaching must be hired by the bad and segregierte teaching"-- according to Lívia Járóka.

CSU: Grace on time 
October ends resolutely the pleased duo Huber-Beckstein over the fate 
In spite of the election debacle no heads, at who spitzes of the Bavarian got CSU still wheel einstweilen the staff debates postpone. 
Leader Erwin Huber and premier Beckstein still have left in her office, the question only, as this grace long lasts. 
Over the fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 prozentigen voice loss resolutely at last October weekend by extraordinary parteitag. 
What many cursing duo, that he not glues on her armchair however already tolerated durchblicken liked. 
It they will coax the frustrated group and the part egg basis, who a day Bavarian tsunami after that"" against the losses of the absolute majority personal consequences called. 
Before five years -- admitted, under the direction of the stagnant at his career peak Edmund Stoiber-- the Christian social union still reached 60,7 percent. Now however, they cannot only guarantee 43,4 percent of the voices an year after the putsch against Stoiber. 
The CSU 46 years" Alleinregierer" long in Bavaria achieve. 
The conservatives indeed stay the bestimmende force in the also important for the Hungarian economy southern province, must however in future govern in a coalition. 
As first sign of the parteiinternen restructuring also the potential successor Hubers, vice president and Bundesagrarminister Horst Seehofer in the exploration team integrated, what with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing gerichteten" free electors "poll talks over a possible Munich coalition guide. 
An irony of the fate he arrives at once from, that hineinkommt" free electors" this one Gabriele Pauli with the list in the legislature, who duo have first profited Anti-Stoiber attitudes the Huber-Beckstein, in order the resolute politician serve then serve gnadenlos. 
Who now CSU direction all her force concentrated on the stabilization of Becksteins. 
In this footbridge lawsuit Stoiber, who the threads up to now pulled out of the background, an active wheels zukommen. The former premier and CSU chairman called the 28. Sep the" bitter day of his political career". 
At Monday remarks in direction CDU-- his view after support from the sister party had far away more deserved the CSU. continued Huber a few toxic 
Other CSU politicians also interpreted the defeat as a signal at the CDU and it at Angela Merkel. 
The CSU to success contributed, not common with someone force action once more on the legs put on, Merkel after the bundestag elections in Sep 2009 not wieder Kanzlerin. 
Merkel, who no hehl have made out of their disappointment over the fiasco, believe, that not the ground loss the CSU auswirken negative on the tall coalition in Berlin. 
What however relative: The wound CSU will not be easy to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats looks while beyond. 
With 18,6 percent the SPD up to now reached she good result in Bavaria since 1946 
Lukaschenko-Opposition: 110-0 
By the elections at Sunday no deputy of the opposition deleted him in the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers meinen, this finds at prosperity and of stability in that from Alexander Lukaschenko guide land, the OECD however supposes Gesetzwidrigkeiten by the breakdown of the voices. 
The OECD, who out of 43 countries of 450 observers entsandt, the elections have not recognised. 
Of end indeed devolves since decades without opposition on legislature of the 10 million inhabitant state. However the himself who names" uniting democratic forces"( ODS) combined Gegenpartei under that before the yesterday elections hoped serious, that Lukaschenko by the smuttily elections and thanks to a constitution change to be 2006 presidency mandate already to fourth time renewed, this time deputy of the opposition in parliament" zulassen comes to the agreement". 
Therefore even the ODS from who beforehand expected boycotts distance taken. 
The Ukraine always economically thanks to the steigenden prices by gas import from Russia dependent. For the relief of the price increases credits were even taken, and the country also the cession the Beltransgas, the properties of the distinguished through the country gas pipeline, Russians agreed. In the hope then suited the opposition, the Ukraine'll her report with the EU, after Lukaschenko and others high-ranking politicians entry ban because of the as ranking undemocratic political system in the EU. 
In what for a passing relaxation the exploitation report of the elections of the OECD, rather the accentuation on the positive movements, instead of on the faults-- like about the ausschliessung of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections-- attended were. 
However the fast report of the OECD already criticised the campaign-- consequentially Oppositionelle cannot not meet in the press-- and in particular the fact, that not the opposition the voices his by the breakdown present at Monday. 
In spite of alledem the opposition gets an improvement in political system recognise: Political prisoners were about laid on free foot, and Minsk even too small confrontations with Moscow ready, while still he the gratefulness the independence the dissident Georgian provinces Süd-Ossetien and Abchasien refuse, although Russia a federative state forms, the two order since a month when independently looks. 
"We forwards and had upside down two steps someone, however the important the, that and the dialogue the EU between Belarus started", Alexander Milinkewitsch said to our leaf. 
After view of the opposition candidate of the presidential elections from 2006 a continuation desirable, although the powerful have" gotten fear, also only an opposing in parliament to give up ". 
The opposition plans no protest measures against the results ahead, only the need of a economy reform rather tries the to explain electors. 
"We here to fight with many problems -- the opposing journals must be printed in Russia, who local authorities put on we by stones in the way drove away, though however I shake, that men always more support the transformation, even the old" -- Milinkewitsch dissociated in allusion it, that not even the meistunterstützte layer the Pensionisten with the Lukaschenko-Regime in agreement the, what single salary is the production social security. 
"Until who thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the rise of the business deficit there is only a question of the time, gemahnende" a cemetery social security at the silent" to crumble begins", thus Milinkewitsch. 
In contrast with opposition politician Russian observers have the elections when qualifies democratically. 
, Explaining leaders of the mission of the community independent states the pressagency Ria Novosti: "The men believe the acts, and not the words". The absence of the opposition is from then on a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electors.

Napolitano does not hide, that there are also" a resource problem on each fall: He conclusively in formation and information invests development. " 
The numerous initiatives for a direct awareness in school frames on behalf of the adolescents, who the work world nähren, at. take an exceptional meaning 
There our duty duty, and not to deflect the attention on this phenomenon to richten from his social seriousness. One. 
In turn the president of the junk room Gianfranco Fini have stressed" how the phenomenon of the work conditional decease forms an urgent social urgency of, what what and awareness all all institutions it impose from we offended, on resolute rules to work, who the goal, what an end to put problem on ". 
"To indicate a light improvement seem, this does however not exclude, that many is the number of the work conditional decease too high", president of the Anmil stresses, Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We not liked that this" positive tendency" of few attention means. Exactly that causes the tragedy in the end." 
"As, that one too little undertakes in reason, in order the phenomenon of the accidents face face believe. One can fight through unlike actions in contrast. 
Strong test and of inspection are thus Mercandelli our opinion after necessary; However also strong measures to explanation of the workers, who already to bait in the school". 
"Is necessary-- so he on top of that puts on-- what the communication and the consciousness raising of the public opinion lights up. 
Though above all a tall responsibility feeling the employers a phenomenon gegenüber, what a social urgency represents from sides, sought-after".

Roma, Alemanno brings the departure gunshot to" commission for the future of the capital " 
We today begin, shall'be s past in March, in Jun balancesheet is pulled. 
That the determined of Kapitol term for the works the who commission the capital Rome for the future" ". The commission have today tomorrow met in new seat behind the Caracalla-Thermen. 
In six months the president Marzano and the large 49 members the commission the direction lines ausarbeiten for Rome. 
, As soon as will be closed the project the town -- and the towncouncil the analysis and of project evaluate, in order in the situation, the strategic in Jun plan for Rome with the "official tampon" the Kapitols and of the mayor Gianni Alemanno mistakes present to knowhow. 
"The commission is and all political, social and cultural opinions independent absolutely are in she to replace" ,-- stress Alemanno. "She will bring proposals for a development plan for Rome, what officials the town political -- and the towncouncil stay. 
He exists no new distribution from competences, only the will, to have a place, at the one to elaborate a tall project for Rome. 
In March her task finish his and the commission again himself auflösen, since someone must have such project a temporary affirmative end point. 
In Jun-- so the mayor proclaims-- we figure the strategic plan, in what we get the carrying out from the commission work profits ". 
Who does the competence of the commission in question queue up, since who ermangele opinion at obligatoriness, that returns Alemanno: ", What all depends on the work to carry out the commission and their proposal, as of. from the quality 
And if she, so as the Attali-Kommission in France, delivers quality full results this gets rid safely in Rome who fall to be then fundamentally her contribution his.

Obama of the first anti-amerikanische president? Here an explanation 
A known American politician, what many is daran, look be independently looked, written: "Barack Obama anti-american the second president. 
The first war Jimmy Carter, who through his decision, the economy the U.S the and decimated befeindeten with that Islam connections cared (and this still today as private man makes) ". 
Now get always violent, just, where the elections approach. 
A lady out of Miami side written internet in someone: "This person is ambitions full. 
Obama are very shameless: He thinks he the high office of a nation the will, who have see over all two black governors and of five black senators! ". 
Real however not have these attacks many to legends; He is a matter around racist attacks and they do not reply the question of the electors: Be he will a good president? And then there are also the polls; To say all, that Obama will earn with a tall lead. 
Also in this fall people, who to talk with the heart and not with the head. 
A journal out of Mississippi, in deep south of the U.S, in her in Editorial written: Only in the voting booth we will know well, who the authentic American Patriot will give his voice. 
Here a mentality of the U.S comes to vorschein, who until to last withholds held. 
", What for who you like, then we decide, we we Kreuchen manufacture development, above say for Obama or for McCain ". 
He people since, who to swear: If Obama wins, we will emigrate out of America. 
Something, what where one never beforehand heard erst jetzt, the black candidate thus certainly seems the success. 
On all take, in spite of universe of these reflections, the final weapon for the democrats is George Bush. 
1500 persons were questioned: What mistakes Bush have committed during his term? 89% have replied: The war in Iraq. 
America changes himself. 
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and again at home skilfully with a step in the behinds. 
In Iraq 4500 soldiers have lost her life and the Americans were not compelled pack. 
All the same, who does Iraq stay the weak point from Bush for the majority. 
This, the to take his position, assist a gigantic task. 
The U.S. The financial collapse also leaves his trace by journalists: In the journals one can already smell the shortening. And many accuse the internet, the" murderer" of the impression press. 
500 American journalists were questioned center the future over her situation and her mental test concerned by PEW Research. 
Today almost pessimistic pessimistic journalists all what her future lights up. 
However they opposite declared who the information concerning Zuständigen not really worrier because of the general credibility. 
How they do not feel thus alone early. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The crisis from 2008 a crisis an economic model, what was destroyed for these journalists. 
On top of that the tall problems come through the met shortening, then the space, in the editors work, around the journal to compose. 
How he is a matter around a problem, what am solved according to the interviewing journalists if will prevent one, that understands the traditional journalism, the tall audience he, not diminish important. 
A clear, but intricate pessimism today fulfils the American journalist. 
Six from ten journalists and Executive senior citizen of the press the advice, that the journalism is on national level on the wrong way. 
In local area even he by the Executives at the 65%. 
Print vs. Broadcast. 
What direction not difficult difficult for the journalists, to introduce, in what web goes. 
The important house groups clear himself the way in internet, been what as the" contract killer" of the press. 
The" economical impression", who the journalists smell, is in order until to 79% upward. 
The 500 interviewing journalists have admitted, 'll the new technology "she brings something good for the journalism". 
The tall tear today consists in American journalism between the leader editors of the newsroom and the reporters, who works for they. 
Sure sure himself, her reporter parts her value with they, while exclusively he 23% on local plain. 
Some think, he to make with the" security in the work". 
The enterprise leaders, who fear, her work inside from three years to waste of, betragen of 47% on national plain. 
By the journalists he 30%. 
What d. Red topic the" sure work" in team( our" editor", Anm..) always a present topic in the U.S. 
Only 13% the journalists work under contract. 
In a gigantic nation, like he the U.S are, with 300 million inhabitant and thousand from journals, publication, radio -- and TV station and internet operator, offer the employers as it beliebt they and so he gets a question from take it leave or it. 
The leader editors very often get very high wages, the editor in contrast every now and then only cannot 10000 euros per month, it retirements-- and insurance money. 
What the holiday looks, so the matter gets intricate: An affirmative amount at days in first year, according to third and according to many after that, in order number from years of 15 holiday days reach in the end reach after an affirmative. 
However the American journalists frequently during the year" sick", as they even admit,. 
There is a question of the climate.

During the lawsuit against he during the letzen week, his dismissal was turned out of the house stop into an stay obligation in Grottaferrata. 
His lawyer Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked darum, to allow the real estate agent from the province town be to transfer in an apartment in the capital by the province town. 
According to the court he derlei relocations (against himself who public prosecutor had pronounced) the possibility has, to influence and to reach his society accuses at he proof material. 
The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon already had himself before some days, when the junk room Milliarden-Dollar-Sparpaket the white house against the 700 balloted: A tall part of the Americans and more to punish Wall Street to save daran interest, who as the economy. 
This confirms the New York times, who, the republican party like the crisis in lope bring back to it to the yesterday expense blur, the himself always more split in her oldman and of fashion rate East Coast-Seele, the always the national institutions and the business community this one and favoured neokonservative, who" who in Washington" and the finance world hostile and fronts v.. in south and what centre of the states earns electors. 
This part of the party owes v his ascent. 
This just now mentioning example is while only a small part the tall changes, who the momentary economic earthquake announces or even already represent: Not only in the U.S, also west and perhaps also over this hinaus his affected from this one. 
, What new under this one conditions to accelerate fear not only in the states when also shine in Europe the crisis events finally shape annehmen and at light devolves. 
The first of these phenomena the new discovery, the unprecedented rebirth of the state in connection with a way renationalisation of the economy. 
In the act the crisis means a decline of the bank -- and finance institutions, what narrow connections to stranger a monstrous amount of the fortunes and owns at once from privathaushalten manage, the in a single state live. 
This means a direct political problem for the governments: Namely worth compared with the affected families he himself, what yes also an huge elector measure represent. 
Then seem economically global, political in contrast she is almost purely national. 
Speech law thus in itself geraten in offside and seems the political Internationalismus to lost: The clear proof of been from the EU to find no common way because of of their zweiteilung in unlike national and international conflicts knows. 
From then on all now expect the intervention of the own state;. Distribution from help back:, Since the crisis got always serious exclusively the U.S in the economical situation of himself without to save foreign help. 
And next to the means they moreover also own the legitimation to use this one: Therefore two not to überwertende conditions under affirmative circumstances, on what differently well no international organisation and no market in similar way resort to know. 
That new insistence, who are put on on, is brought sector in remaining in perfect accord with the always tall meaning, who lately used in the economy with an on narrow in connection: The Territorialität. 
There is now just paradoxical way, thus so as we, for years in a connected total empire convince it of merchandise take place, in an empire of the always differentiate technologies, the immaterial, that we on once note, as thus always more our future from the essentiell material things depend: Water, crop and oil. 
This one indeed all the world certain from a place at the other transported, am but however on outside paraphrased closely with someone bit erde connected to a territory. 
From then on this is, who have a such territory at disposal, an other opposite, who otherwise crop unproductive, water fates free area in someone from oil deposits live, in advantage. 
I now come to second novelty, who however assumes a short insertion. 
Who territory, who government, who policy says, also tell Leadership it. 
In this sense to produce the financial crisis two converging phenomena seem. 
On the one hand that is there look around the need Leaderships, well what need after someone, who does, one settles the things know. 
On the other side a wave of the indignation over the existed directions, v. now insists 
On top of that a deep be sufficient and still worrying in certain sense aspect in the end comes: A confidence loss, an Unduldsamkeit, a picture of the Unzweckmäßigkeit, a feeling of the distance, who whole office the western countries on a whole class from manager execute. 
There thus seem himself the conviction under tall parts who population the way to railways, that not only he the acts the social elite, only already her idea world, her Way of Life, her cultivation in large sense of the word, are, who content himself the majority when always foreign and überkommener represent. 
The demand for Leadership then feeds underground a powerful movement of the entmachtung of the distinguished class and of the traditional political establishments however branched out. This demonstrates in unexpected" revolt" of the electors and in sudden change of mind of the collective condition of the last time:, Delegated the ascent of the conservative in Austria and Bavaria beginnend mit over the collapse of the Labour-Partei in Great Britain, to against Bush( and perhaps the victory also here communicates the right in Italy to a role). 
One earns the impression, when good the old elite, their party, her programme but also her rite, publications, of intellectual believers,, manch einer got legends she format, always more understanding problems and from then on worthy of few representative concerning what, what today the west in the inferior social layers before himself go and from the financial crisis still and reinforce until hin to Überdimensionalität wheeled. 
Against universe of what soberly he exaggerated, from a" rebellion of the masses" to speak up. 
Who is far away eyes though open to stops while certainly not he. 
The Superkleber, who let hochgehen 
The forces of the gravity thanks to a glue hochklettern to know Superman. 
This is the object from four American research centers, from who someone have was now apparently almost sufficient at goal. 
Annoyed qcm with an on a surface from only 2,5 Kleber there have succeeded the researchers, to record someone 100 heavy kg bodies on a vertical wall. 
Who studio an American publication has, and of the results the researchers the university the Georgia institutes Technology the Air Force Research from Dayton, Akron, Laboratory publish. 
The inventing from the researcher team material a development a who already used of glues, what an exceptional carbon pattern, called Kohlenstoff-Nanoröhrchen, use. 
"One can imagine like a line of ordered to a stack tubes the principle of the Klebers", explain of Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia to institutes Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists himself from the to inspire feet of the Geckos let, overcast, the what a perfect stop to give animal. 
The durchgeführten with unlike materials like glass Teflon and ribbon paper tests shown, that the new Kleber is zehnmal strong, when and to go away let at once" the stop aptitude the feet the reptiles problemlos from the wall ",, spirited according to Liming Dai of the faculty for engineer sciences of the university from Dayton. 
At walls ENTLANGWANDERN? "This material cannot be put on on as short-lived glue", on top of that put Liming Dai on. 
About in order emporzugehen like Spiderman at walls? Perhaps already, thus fascinate profits rather think at someone few about the researchers, electric like about the connection appliances, thus the Nanoröhrchen likewise leaders from heat and of electricity. 
Large application areas cannot result in the area from the astronautics. 
For the time the Superhelden must then still wait. 
Who also other way the research the university from Berkeley, California, devotes to a new Kleberart. 
Who himself in an article of the American Chemical Society the Californian scientists and thereby always present a glue out of mike fibers as hairs even clean through movement on a surface of dust a perfect liability bewahren. 
Drugs: Never with fruit juice take 
Caution before Grapefruit-, orange-- and apple juice. 
These drinks, what because of of their cool quality and of their vitamin fortune v. 
David Bailey, professor who of university western Ontario in London, indicate repeat on the risk wrap up as also fresh fruit juices in connection with takings hin. Within the context of the 236. gathering of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia he again beaten alarm: He satisfies a glass apple-, orange -- or, decided around the acceptance aptitude vital drugs forasmuch as to decrease, that this one is practically eliminated and according to the bless you the patients imperil. 
Grapefruitsaft already the effects some drugs under suspicions, responsible for in contrast to be, like antibiotics, Antiasthmatika, heart cycle drugs, anxiolytischer and neurologischer means, until hin to increase too toxic levels. 
Drugs same in danger agency of the drug doctor and of patient this in a report before two years before the dangers blend warned, and stress, it to respect, what in connection with mean as about Diazepan or Metadon drunk. 
He also NICHT NUR GRAPEFRUIT orange juice and apple juice substances according to the experts restrained to hinder the drugs. 
The list of the hinder from the fruit juices agents is long. 
From then on the call from Michele Carruba, what di director the Università Statale Milano: "Am usually deviated at once at the unlike international makers from such results, who thus freisteht he. 
From then on he recommends himself to question the compress supplement a chemist or doctor to vine harvests and, if confusion still exist, no shyness", the expert of the Ansa-Agentur stresses. 
Economy noble price goes at Paul Krugman

Topic immigration: Who YORK times questions NEW: Are ITALIEN RASSISTISCH? 
Italy," the former country of the emigrants since short a the preferring country for migrants ", what only with resistance taken. 
Continue this Belpaese out of that a nation from racists? This questions the New York times in a long article, who all the topic the racism in Italy dedicated and from the fall of the young, Burkina-Faso stocky Abdul William Guibre, who before a month suppose in Milan murdered after he had stung a compress cookies. 
The fall generates from that, what the times as "paradox of the north qualifies": The northern areas this one" many at integration and of work possibility" to exist, and however" the high degree at anti-immigrationistischen Sentiments and the tall support of the Lega to write down north ". 
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italian and immigrant the times appoints large episodes of the intolerance out of Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
And not only this. 
Also the new, brought in through the Lega legislation against immigration and to fast expulsion of the illegal immigrants is represented as signs of the climate transformation in Italy. 
A movement, what also the pope and the state president underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the pope by a meeting on the Quirinal in order and a cooperation state the racism between church to struggle." 
Students victims of the high until to 900 euros per rooms rent prices 
The market for apartments for students knows no crises. 
According to the last inquiry of the Sunia, the trade union, a single room a student until to 900 euros in Milan and of 600 in Rome cost. 
"This phenomenon have already accepted very grave trains. To lose whole hosts from students so really to study their law, since not their family in the situation, they in this altitude to support" according to the official of the Sunia, Laura Mariani" in these towns the tall demand on behalf of the students to a Deformierung of the market represents, the also the other inhabitants harmed. 
Moreover the many rent offers contain a line from infractions: Free contracts, failing recordings, without rent price border, illicit inferior rents. 
For the Sunia pass the need after exceptional measures, what too low through a revision of the taxation rent prices bring. 
By exact contemplation of the inquiry, that a sleep place needs about 450 euros in Milan in quarter Brianza development turn out heraus; A single room begins by 650 euros (in quarter ribbon Nere) and euros results with 800 in quarter Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or of good 900 euros in quarter Vittoria. 
In Florence a sleep place costs on average 350/400 euros, a room of 700 
Where in Bologna, the students concentrate in the quarters around the university, 250/280 euros for a sleep place from distress, 370 until 500 for a single room. 
In Rome the prices find in the quarters around the uni by about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a place in a double-room.

In the small towns the prices are low, thus they a tall weight in the urban economy.

Goodbye to old cinema Paradiso her historical Kinosäle closes the towns 
The historical cinemas close Multiplexkinos because of of the begünstigten. 
"How a town without Kinosäle is a blind town, a face without eyes." 
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what momentary in the tall urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces, happens. 
The lawsuit of the exclusion of the cinemas, who the tall Multisaalkomplexe with the birth in the outskirt started, mean the death for the one eel cinema in centre on long visibility. A lawsuit, not and appear only unavoidable who irrevocable, only also the trains of a cultural crime contributes. 
Affected most of the time historical places full memories," he to lose a friend, with what one a bit full of streets emotions put back ", thus who director the film" Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who he the Oskar and the tall price before 20 years from Cannes brought in. He is a matter Nostalgie around the history of a cinema and of what, what daraus consist, in a lose for always cinema world to live. 
The numbers, what the Anec, the central activity bandage delivers, attribute distinctly language to someone: In the lasts of five years traditional from 316 cinemas have mustn't close the monstrous amount; The cinemas in the tall towns paid to tall part for this mine: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and of 5 in Palermo. 
To the strong at affected areas the Emilia-Romagna belong with 82 lost cinemas, followed from who and Toskana the Lombardei with 44 with 41 
This proves it, that the Multiplexkinos are the main culprits, thus he just now these three areas, in who tall number of these modern cinemas was noted: With 195 in the last the Lombardei brings 5 years to the lists at, 81 not only but also he in the Toskana in the Emilia-Romagna. 
"The business have elaborated in an irrational way", according to Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec," indeed useable useful, that also himself new patterns devoted, despite everything at first position the erhalt of the already stays existed, thus locks up room in the town, not all his regular visitor prepare to consult instead of the old a Multiplexkino in the outskirt. 
And here the failing budget still stays for the back of the activity bandage express eight: The wrote down of state mistake burden behaves about 10 million euros. 
There is a shame of ethical moral viewpoint, that the government not respects the existing laws. 
Around the sector to keep up, euros between 16 and of 18 million in year from distress". 
Interesting the fall from Bologna because of of the fears in order the old Kinosäle determined, this through a treaty between the municipality and of the Anec to protect; He is a matter around the first treaty of this way in Italy, what aims it,, and this not only in historical centre, but also in the outskirt. 
Under the vorhergesehenen measures also fiscal Bevorteilungen for the cinema operators as advantages for the audience concerning the nahverkehrs: He will be permissible, in the verkehrslimitierten areas of the centre to go and moreover to favourable park due to park. 
"There is a cheering initiative", according to Giuseppe Tornatore," ego hope, that and also still other towns our example anschliessen development new plans entwerfen over hinaus. 
Certain though we also need a good Audio -- and video installation, in order cannot something against the gas power of the Multiplexsäle, thus in the end the audience from today demanding. 
An important topic is always for me the defense of the traditional cinema: The closing of the" Supercinema" from Baghiera, the place of my childhood and of youth, the decisive point, who I brought to it, cinema that" Nuovo Paradiso" to found, even if I had already trifled since 10 years with the thought. 
Since 25 years I live in Rome; If I pass at Rialto or at Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, there, thus have me many distinct emotions erlebt, I turn to side, in order the dusty mustn't not see bills. 
The connections between policy and'Ndrangheta led to arrest of the mayor from Gioia Tauro 
"Ready ready, to adapt the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli to the decisions of the municipality.. 
The accusations of the bar of the Antimafia-Behörde Kalabriens against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality Gioia Tauro, who today tomorrow apprehends because of complication in Mafia businesses, grave. 
In handcuffs taken Gioacchino Piromalli also got, the old intermediary between the clan and of the public administration, as well as what nephew: The lawyer, what same names like the boss of the clan bring back, already the Mafia because of complication in criminal unification condemned, then to an allowance from 10 million euros. 
"Each way of moral and legal standard looking down", thus write the lawyers," decided the two local administrations to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consultation activities. " 
"Therefore there was the Mafia group possible made according to the judges on official way in the townhalls who mitzubestimmen policy the public administration." 
The president of the regional board of Kalabriens Agazio Loiero does not refuse, that there are all others in his area" as an exception, on connections from local administration and what do to wheel organized crimes. "" What there are places, in what who concentration is the Mafia tall when in other, in such connections practically unavoidable. 
However there also have local politicians, who the impression who'does Ndrangheta resist: Hero, what himself do to get a white vest. " 
The arrests from today tomorrow follow this one of past Jul, with what bran who the clan Piromalli got enthauptet police. 
Since end of the last Apr been the towncouncil from Gioia Tauro and the local administration the local politicians their municipality office dismissed. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, May after the second ballot of 2006 to head who middle right-wing coalition elected. 
He shouted scandal when the resolution of the towncouncil ordered the Präfektur. 
He arraigned Minniti, who he admitted to invent all out of politically strategic reasons it in the Vizeinnenminister Marco. The judges though tomorrow declare in link with the arrest warrant from today, that even had the Piromalli-Clan he ask. 
Out of an Abhöraktion in link with the inquiries to fall Dal Torrione, have had the arrangement, the desires of a contractor to come of, the acquaintance masses a Rep. of the tall group around the Piromalli the measures the public administration this clan wodurch identical with the interests. " 
, If the energy entspringt out of the waves the tall suddenly fail 
He not someone drying up money source who over 70% surface of the planet does and erst jetzt cover glimmers this the tall energy enterprises the world to understand. 
Waves, currents and Gezeiten how the new renewable energy sources are who now all to look, and also to occupy to look of, about giant Chevron. 
The possibility, to earn energy out of the movements of the sea,; Not by chance these studies since the first oil crisis considerably intensified himself. 
When the price of the oil collapsed around 1980 gas one the idea of the sea energy, now though called the environment organisations and the upward oil price for new impulses in this sector. 
Who World Energy Council( WEC) estimate in London that were extended 15% the world-wide energy needs from the produce through the ocean waves energies. 
This equaled the double of the produce momentary through nuclear powerstations energy. 
On top of that moreover still came the currents and Gezeiten. 
Giant by attack. 
The first enterprise, now lays the sea energy who, Enersis in year of 2005 a contract to institution from a powerstation in north of Portugal signs. 
When this news was published around a revolutionary step there himself to bargain seemed. 
Late two years now always more he enterprises out of the traditional energy branch, lay the marine energy extraction who. 
"Chevron examines these technologies" known the American American giant according to the spokesman of someone enterprise in Wall Street newspaper and weigh the possibility with we team up." 
There go hierbei in order to throw the acquisition an admission from the American energy commission, who is necessary, around a project before the coast of Alaskas. 
. If one thinks, that just now still oil in Alaska through the U.S promoted Bush and recently only gets president the plans for new Bohrungen in speed put on. 
Next to Chevron the enterprises Verdant Power Inc are also. new out of new York and Ocean Power Jersey, the in the new branch invest; The details are also not known, so observers thus speak up from a steigenden interest. 
Still improvement worthy technologies. 
Expert still talks from someone in aufbruch of sealing technology, this not in the end, since the last doubts are still not clarified by sides of the environmentalists. 
So far seriously to cause projects too took ecological problems like this one in Portugal and also Scotland from rather small dimension and glimmer no. 
In order however energy produce produce in tall scale, he needs technologies with intensify tall impact on the environment. 
There are unlike possibilities: Ocean Power about a system from connected together buoys wears down. 
The batch of the waves, what the buoys on and downstairs moves, over piston and of top hat are turned inside the swimmers into hydraulic impression. 
, What anew this one pushes a turbine a generator activates. 
The current gets skilfully over inferior conduits to coast it. 
Until now there gives four expected installation of this way, what only still on the national authorisation wait. A part of the winning energy cannot also serve for military arrangements. 
Verdant Power produce while already energy cooperation submarine turbines East River for a merchandise department-store and a park bib in from N.Y. 
The water movements while the Gezeiten drifts the turbines at, what who through the be born drehbewegung generator does eat. 
According to Verdant already wait for a long snake from possible customers on the necessary Autorisierungen around these energy sources to profits. 
Only the waves, then the Gezeiten. 
An exceptional interest deserves the potential according to the institute for current extraction research immediate, what in the Gezeiten put on. 
, Although he is also a matter around an irregular phenomenon the Gezeiten are thus prediction liquid as wind currents good of, the sun irradiation, and from then on a trustworthy current source. 
Just now the Gezeitenenergie there the, as New York, Maine it, already to invest 7,5 million dollar in year of 2008 brought for 2009 million are already planned ahead until to 35.
