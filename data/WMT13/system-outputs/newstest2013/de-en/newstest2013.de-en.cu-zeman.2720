A republican strategy to oppose the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policies, with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center, the latter for a myth, it confirmed that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by the strikes.
The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the US, moreover, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is for sure: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine some of the democratic system in the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the US states for the conduct of elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of american governments since 2009, new laws announced that the procedures for the registration or the ballot difficult.
This phenomenon has after the elections in November 2010, in which new 675 republican officials in 26 states has been registered.
As a result, 180 bills introduced in 2011 alone, the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that voters a Lichtbildausweis and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws that also shortened the period for early voting, the right declared invalid, as voters to register on Election Day, and citizens denied the right to vote, for which a Gerichtsakte.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state of the electorate wants a Lichtbildausweis can boast.
Indiana is the first state that such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law in Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to this practice in other states.
Over the last two years promoting it in 34 states, bills with which voters are forced to produce a Lichtbildausweis.
It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec is not on the cards as a universal health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i. e. no vocal 21 million people from a government agency issued Lichtbildausweis their state.
Moreover, five million Neuwähler in 2012 does not have such a card.
There are, however, often more than a hundred dollars to pay the required ID.
The new restrictions are young people, minorities and low-income people disproportionately affected.
In fact, 25% of african-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the necessary Lichtbildausweis.
This goes further.
The students, who are seen as voters their voice more to democratic candidates, it is in a number of states do not allow their of their establishment Lichtbildausweis issued to use.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of Angel Jagdvereinen-or, more to the republican side to choose from these clubs issued cards for elections to use.
In 2004, a federal state of the voters asked for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state that such a requirement.
In 2011, a dozen states have passed laws, which voters demand that they prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at the hispanic votes to limit.
Because it is clear that two out of three hispanic voters to the Democratic Party.
In addition, republican legislators in 2011 in eight states laws, with the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
Also, you have the right of individuals and groups, those voters to provide support to the register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign for the registration of voters in the general election in 2004, helped to around 10 million citizens to register.
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of recording Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006 by 17%.
In addition, republican legislators in five other states passed laws aimed at the period for early voting.
For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida, 33% of the electorate who voted in advance, african-Americans, even though it is only 13% of the voters in the state.
The same is true of the hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who have chosen in advance.
In contrast, the white, 76% of voters, only 46% of the electorate who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic lawmakers and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
A number of bills have been through the veto of the democratic governors blocked.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened in the most controversial pieces of legislation.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states passed laws that require a Lichtbildausweises colleagues.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012, no doubt, the exercise of the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws passed by and see them as a clear goal of influencing the outcome in key states for 2012.
A report from the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted laws, 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College, which are needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system would have a major impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is for sure: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine some of the democratic system in the United States.
Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: the test should be made or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes flawed results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater reluctance of the men already undecided for the implementation of Früherkennungstests.
The test should be made or not?
We have the views of two doctors.
In the studies conducted in the United States, insisted many confounding factors between the control, so it is difficult to interpret the data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection.
This study has also shown that when Nachbeobachtung after 12 years of the likelihood of the education of metastases by 30-40% higher if there is no screening was carried out.
I therefore recommend that the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years ago, when a direct relatives, already in the prostate cancer was diagnosed.
Men in african-american origin, there is also a greater risk.
The most important thing is to make the right choice as soon as a cancer diagnosed.
There are cancers that aggressively and others, the indolent.
The patient, the extent of the risk of his cancer really was made clear by the possible options, in which Prostatakrebse remain untouched if the quality of life in the long term is not affected, and in these cases is more of an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, for many men, the cancer has seen no treatment, because their cancer is aggressive and not a threat to their lives.
It proposes an active monitoring them and give them in advance of the disease treatment.
It certainly with increasing accuracy the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and who does not.
I therefore recommend that the implementation of the tests.
It is most important, but with his doctor to talk in order to determine whether he should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the international society for Movember Urologie has developed a device with which it is possible to the pros and cons of the PSA tests to assess.

Prevention of the disease.
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research is adopting a healthy lifestyle, the best way to minimise the risk of it becoming ill.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eating well and get enough.
“If there are no more smokers, this value at at least a 50% increase,” said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the canadian Krebsgesellschaft.
But it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several also remain unresolved.
For the canadian Krebsgesellschaft remains the fight against tobacco addiction a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of people.
“Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
In accordance with the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of disease.
They seem to be the risk of breast, Grimmdarm-Mastdarm-Speiseröhren-neuronal and uterine cancer.
“The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life against Grimmdarmkrebs protects”, he added.
The diet
The organisation also recommends the consumption of red meat.
In great quantity, it increases the risk of a fairy tale or of becoming ill.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking or drying Salzen can lead to formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the cells and the development of cancer,” he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, a number of scientists, the connection between Vitaminzusätzen and cancer.
Your investigation, but is not conclusive.
After the canadian Krebsgesellschaft are the studies on vitamin E, contradictory.
While the study may reduce the risk of prostate cancer has discovered a different, more of an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer has also not yet clear.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family kind.
“The implementation of a Früherkennungstest does not lead to cancer.”
The Higgs Boson analysed
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs-Bosons last summer, a certain amount of consternation, and for good reason.
It is thought that in fact, this Boson in nothing less than the mechanism for the mass of all the objects in the universe is responsible.
And finally, this is the final piece of the Standard Model, the existence of our best-or “least bad” explanation of nature and the behavior of matter-predicted, but still not empirically observed.
But for the physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt, that we have a real new particles, and that the Higgs Boson predicted by the Standard Model strongly resembles.
Moreover, that seems to be confirmed by new data this week at a big physics-Congress in Kyoto were presented, but it still missing data about completely safe.
Nevertheless, we believe that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk, to deceive, and let us see what is at stake.
In this world, there is inevitably a crucial law, which means that two objects, not at the same time in the same place may be present.
It is not possible, against this rule to breach and you try not to, as you will hurt.
Because even if the particle really is a strange world, it turns out that, for them, such a law also applies: the Pauli's Ausschlussprinzip, which says that two particles do not have the same room at the same time if they are unable to fill in the same “Quantenzustand”, with a “state”, by and large, from some of its properties.
Assuming the particle physicists share in two categories.
In one corner, the good citizens of the Fermione be described as polite and Pauli-the principle.
And in the other the Bosonen, a nasty bunch of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, or at least not this principle, which means that, in fact, they are at the same time in the same place.
These Bosonen are based, according to the website of the Particle adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Mesonen here, we will not be dealing with and the “Kraftteilchen”, through which the great forces of nature and spread of the Higgs Boson somehow would be used.
It must be emphasised, however, that not all these Bosonen such exotic creatures are, as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle of, then it is only thanks to a Bosons banality of exceptional: the Photon, or the “Lichtteilchen”, “the messenger” of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electrical load faster or change the direction, the electromagnetic field exactly in this place “disrupted”, such as a pebble in a pond was thrown.
By this “disturbance” created an electromagnetic wave, infra-red light (or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a Photon and therefore one of the “Bosonen carriers of the force”.
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, “disrupted” that must be the Boson shows.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the magnetic field, the virus has to be very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks zerfurcht could be.
Why is a giant like CERN particle accelerators, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a total of 27 km, to such energy to achieve.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again to help the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd to explain.
There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all of the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, would never even a piece of paper from the fridge.
And, equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field, those that do have a mass, while the other (as, incidentally, the Photon) have no mass.
For what can all this research now “be good,” says Mrs Plamondon?
For the science, they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all variations between the observations and predictions of the SM to investigate.
There are, in fact, many physicists who eagerly hope that such departures, otherwise the slightest difference a door to open a “new physics” and the model could plug some holes.
It must be said that the latter still major shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the force of gravity (ups!) and the dark matter provides around 80% of the subject matter of the universe-ups (again!).
However, the CERN such deviations, until now, has not been found.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population is difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to think that we do not have.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs-not suspect that their work such a revolution would trigger.
You saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle-in the Bell Labs has worked, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 even the first Dauerstrichlaser (were the first gepulst) has developed-said that the laser at the beginning, rather than a “Laborspielerei” was considered.
Imagine …
Moreover, applications from all the instruments, the research.
For example, in turn, Willard Boyle 1969 during his work in the optics of a small Lichtsensor developed.
Although it is not the original purpose was to serve this sensor today all digital cameras around the world as the “eye” and gave him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change our lives, but it means that you really can never know …
Palliative care-the best way to die … &pipe; Le Devoir
With its committee for “death with dignity” Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of Lebensendes.
The debate must soon be resumed, although a bill being prepared.
However, in this very important subject much still to do.
Le Devoir, has tried to look as this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer he aufzehrte, he had a period of two years.
“They gave me five years to live, I have seven years managed,” he said, half-hearted in his bed in the home for palliative care-Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, lying, in which he reached the previous day.
“However, it is always a shock, it could not be prepared for,” he says.
The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents alone to use the toilet and even to eat.
On the table sits a delicious lunch, he resigned to take a dinner help.
Courageously he manages to smile and even with strangers, which is around him, his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest wish is that one of my cure diarrhoea, as this is humiliating,” he shares with.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
“In the course of our lives, we learn that a man on foot pinkelt,” Brodeur told Pierre, a psychologist in the home-Victor Gadbois.
In return for certain persons Kindheitsphase is an unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the ability of the person,” a step back, he notes.
Because, according to several people involved in the work of the palliative care to find big events in the middle of these setbacks.
The patients in the home for palliative care-Victor Gadbois be sent, are all suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who care for them, not with the so-called “curative care.”
For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear, “deliberately and by suffocation” to die.
But as a result of the disease, I really got to know my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I have no wishes more in life,” she says, before they accepted that if a mask of her injury, her breathing helps.
You expected in the next few days, despite a recent visit to her son, who is from Italy.
In the home-Victor Gadbois provides you with a group of voluntary personal care and assistance in the diet.
The palliative care is then used when there are no other options.
In order to make the deaths more comfortable.
In Quebec, 11.700 residents on a bed for palliative care.
That is very little, considering that one day we all will die.
This is the life in the best possible conditions continue, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
It grants the wishes of a dying depending on Mundpflege with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics need their Blutzuckerspiegel no longer control.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we have X a beer served during the night has died.
This morning, his son the beer at the feet of the deceased austrinken.
“We help relatives and patients alike,” said Nathalie Pflegedirektorin Savard.
In the home-Victor Gadbois is not a day as the other.
In addition to an old man from 93 years ago, which is the last in the courtyard Familienzusammenkunft enjoys and well supported by his pillow, but his motion, dies in honour of a young man from 36 years ago by his parents, his wife and his two small children is surrounded, tragically, after he has tried everything to survive.
“For six months, three to five beds with cancer patients aged less than 45 years of evidence,” Dr. Christiane shares with Martel worries.
53% of the home-Victor Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their Wohnstätte, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, i. e. a care to ease the suffering of patients, if they have reached the last stages of their lives, both at home and in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And a number of organizations, such as the home-Victor Gadbois and society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize in more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
These very serious shortcoming in the care of Quebec ensures that several of them in the palliative care specialist doctors, the adoption of a law on euthanasia and suicide assistiertem with concerns.
Since the month of October is a manifesto circulated by prominent figures in the palliative care as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe was signed to its objection to such an initiative.
Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec, the health system is not effective enough to ensure that all the right to high-quality palliative care before it is accepted, to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient, the 14 days with severe pain in the emergency room was without measures to alleviate has taken.
I am afraid that the patients just want to die because they lack adequate health care.
And, at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst forecasts fought until the last day.
The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal, as they broke off a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my Onkologin that I will stop the treatment, she replied that they regret that I am giving up the fight, told them.
However, she had told me that I was in the end.
Not omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, to thank the staff that this desire is not granted, after their pain eased by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that the palliative care in Schmerzbehandlung not omnipotent.
After Elsie Monereau, head of the society of the palliative care home palliative care Greater Montreal talk about 8% of patients on a Schmerzbehandlung.
At the very end of life, the doctors so often on the terminale Sedierung back, leading to the patients either sporadic or permanently until the time of his death einzuschläfern.
We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief, increasingly have the possibility to these terminale Sedierung resort.
Patients, the pain will not be eased, all say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that does not necessarily mean, “I want you to put to me,” but, “I would like to see my pain.”
The implementation of this report was made possible because of a canadian Journalismusstipendiums Gesundheitsforschungsinstitute.
Large-scale Immobilienskandale in Quebec
Officials of the company, the Straßenbauamtes Bauhauptgewerbes Geldbeschaffer, political parties and specialists of the italian mafia tell every day, they know a great “system”, in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso are enmeshed.
An “industry” to the taxpayer of Quebec was very expensive, especially in the 1990's and 2000's.
“It is strange how the system is unraveling, since then it has taken drastic measures,” Jacques witzelt Duchesneau, MEP in Quebec and a former chief of police in Montreal.
The scandal was it based on a thorough study of the incidence of fraud in connection with contracts to Straßenbauarbeiten revealed in Quebec, the then-Prime Minister only reluctantly agreed to.
The “Duchesneau report” established a direct link between the industry, the secret funding of political parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010,” he said, “the Department of Transport had only a billion dollars to the Treaties saved” because some zügelten squandering their instincts, in order to get their share.
The Charbonneau Commission “has already made two mayors,” he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in “the tactics behind the individuals show.”
A 2011 launch, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit
The 2011 launch, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit doing with their troops to accountants, tracking down and analysts of the government too much effort.
In addition, the officer “Marteau force”, which since 2009 has ensured that the “Kanalisationskartell” Montreal in artificial inflation of contracts more going on …
In recent weeks it has carried out a series of raids and accusations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who is from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city, has resigned.
He is suspected of repeatedly public contracts in exchange for accepting bribes.
Specifically, the engineers have been indicted Straßenbauamts Montreal, and entrepreneurs of italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has a sensation by the Commission of the operation of the “system” for the preservation of public contracts.
He has several years to 3% of the value of the contracts awarded in Montreal to a Mafia-connected with the mediator, paid the money to the Union Montreal party, which Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has in the 2000s everywhere his hand in the game, by more than 000 canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to Provinzparteien, particularly at the time in power before liberals.
He also confessed to an illegal fund-raising for the former Vice-President of liberal Nathalie Normandeau organizing.
Kanalisationsverträge, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant, before the Commission described in detail: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, and-to the tune of $736.000 bribes in return for Kanalisationsverträge whose cost it artificially inflated.
Other officials of the Straßenbauamtes have admitted that they could grease the bills with false benefits artificially by 30-40% aufblähten.
In addition, the organisers of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay, that he deliberately overlooked on a shadow budget, its coffers filled with illicit funds.
As a result of these disclosures is Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, with Montreal in a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, the proposed raising the alarm.
As mayor of the Stadtbezirks Rivière-of-Prairies, in the east of the island, rejected from 2010 on the sale of a Gemeindegrundstücks on that for $5 million and acquired for 1.6 million of real estate developers in the booming housing market has been sold on.
70% of black money in election campaigns
The investigation, which is being carried out at the end, she says, “on a cord, which allows for the operation of the suspected of ant system to understand the problem and stop the perpetrators of shame”.
It says that the procedure “painful, but positive.”
We are going to need to clean up the wound, but only for certain Montreal fraud investigation unit, as well as a supervisor for a return of the questionable practices to prevent.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, notes that “officials of several hundred million dollars have stolen”, but, above all, reflect on the role of the “elected officials about the tactics in the picture” if it is not involved in the fraud.
On the basis of a 70% of illicit funds in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec witzelt he: “I have been told that this is a poor simulacrum of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing that the donations to parties at 100 dollars to limit what he says nothing about the situation would change: “as long as the spending limit is not strictly limited to black money in politics in circulation.”
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system of procurement and the financing of the parties: “we cannot fall deeper; by the things with courage to the bottom, we can the House on a more solid footing with more controls and laws to rebuild.”
If the history of the international reputation of Quebec and the Montreal damages, calling for Mr Duchesneau those who laugh, a look in its own backyard to throw …
“PSG is not the FC Barcelona!”
In this season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How would you explain this progress?
You can make it with a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players are.
Every day I am making progress on its side.
Technical staff has given me too much.
These elements will spur me on to my Spielniveau every day to improve.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football everything is very quickly.
But I will not stop in excitement.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training the INF Clairefontaine until my Spielzeit in Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
You are thus by Carlo Ancelotti introduced competition advantage …
The new entrants this summer are accustomed to games very high level.
You also know that any Trainingseinheit is crucial.
This means that, as a player, I have to stand up to and doing his best wishes.
Incidentally, it gives me a lot of Carlo Ancelotti in relation to my Spielposition.
He is co-coaches as Claude Makelele, helped in the same position as I played.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect all technicians.
In the Ligue 1, at the moment, there is no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a rich experience and has many title with prestigious clubs won.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I was a Verletzungsserie recovers.
The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation of my services.
What are your thoughts on the first part of the season, the PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of us Spitzenreiters.
But we lie in wait.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League, we have in this way for the final 8 qualified.
What is the objective of the club in this competition.
We will try, as much as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we are against very good teams our input.
First of all, we want to lead our group in Porto, so that we have the return leg of the Achtelfinales Heimspiel as possible.
Can the PSG in the short term, a major european club?
He has already had its budget …
A major european club, Paris title to win and in the long term a name.
That is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG the resources so that this project is taking shape.
It would be a big failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 to win, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really at the heart of this title, cream off.
Last season we were sealed off.
In May, we were disappointed because we have been strong enough for the victory.
We have the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be master with 79 points …
But another team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.
I believe that this is the right thing to do.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux in the title fight, I believe that we have the tools to win.
Do you think that the media is too much to expect from PSG?
In the light of what has been invested, and the players that we have, it is natural that much is expected of us.
We accept that entirely.
However, when we are in a Heimspiel against Troyes 4-0 win, and we still find something we can reproach, is a little frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We could never every weekend with a 4-0 win.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to establish a Spielkonzept.
A team builds over time.
In the Champions League we have shown strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club for the last two seasons, for the final 8 to qualify, and also the huge expenditure.
In terms of the sums invested believed on your time out with 15 points ahead.
This would mean that our opponents and the french championship ignored.
Lyon and Marseille in the last season were not good, this new “PSG geboostet.”
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that, in the month of May, the winner will be smiling and tell us that, despite the difficulties, we won.
The PSG seems full of performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to depend.
All the better, to be a “Zlatan-dependency.
This means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and scoring many goals.
That is why he came, and he shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he's a great player and a world star with respect.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respected the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is exceptional.
This encourages others to her Spielniveau to improve.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world is, it allows all other also to make progress.
How have you Euro 2012 with the french national team experience?
As a disappointment.
I was anxious to take part in this match.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented something Spielzeit party.
I have seen things, from which I am stronger.
Today, I find it good games in the national team.
That was my baptism with the “Bleus” my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learnt our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behavior.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps, at the top of the “Bleus”?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the Qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup.
The coach is strictly, is close to the players and to the victory.
As Laurent Blanc.
But I would not want to see a comparison.
Blanc had achieved its objective, we had qualified for the championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps, the “Bleus” will lead to Brazil.
Put on October 16 in Spain forced draw (1: 1) a Auftaktspiel?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has been for everyone else.
Before the meeting in Spain, I have never had a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin is possible without pay and selling bank
The reverse of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and administrative fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies to a political vision tangible: the belief that the current Bankmonopolen shaped monetary system, leading to financial crises.
In fact, by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin, a virtual currency (but in dollar, euro convertible, etc.), as well as a record for the secure exchange of such as BitTorrent, the peer-to-peer file.
With 15,000 computers in the network have already been some 200,000 transactions.
Several thousand websites than accept Bitcoin donations or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011, a peak of 30 euros ($23), had succeeded, it had fallen five months later, at $2, before today to around $10 has recovered (the courses are on the website listed bitcoincharts. com).
Nothing particularly Beeindruckendes compared to the real world trade currencies or financial products.
However the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies shown interest for this.
It describes as “the Bitcoin virtual currency with the greatest success,” “in competition with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to the traditional currencies.”
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that will be used to make progress in a video game, which is winning games, or buy (and sometimes zurücktauschen).
The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
However, each time the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed.
With Bitcoin, all at the same time, Rechnungsbuchs Netzknoten repositories of the auditors, money-issuers and buyers and sellers.
Where is this network?
Each transaction between two users place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the users pay for each other to be able to choose what the anonymity.
A number of the associated with this transaction data electronically through a double cypher system signed.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the volume of Bitcoins in the whole network Rechnungsbuch widespread public accounts are available.
The crucial step is to ensure that these new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task on computers will be launched, with the winner, a kind of temporary Zentralbankier is the privilege has the additional line added.
It is a carving up the file, i. e. the conversion of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprints.
The computer “take” the new transaction and do a number, before the whole “chopped up, covered in quicklime.”
The aim is to be number one, to find a special fingerprint (many zeros at the start).
If this figure was found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is in the long term with the chain of all other transactions linked, and any modification of the fingerprint would change.
If a user to Betrügen twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money will pay, was only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other remains without a link, because they both have different fingerprints.
The computer, which the task, receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will reward this regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins are in circulation, bringing to 21 million, but limited to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, which leaves some room …
In addition, the difficulty of the task, with any improvement in as much computing power as increased.
The lives of the network has had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin, have been attacked and the Bitcoin-deposits stolen.
“The used weakness concerns not the underlying protocol,” assured Pierre Noizat just Paymium has introduced, a company to pay with real money is and the network of Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the potential of the anonymous money laundering through this service.
However, cash also these shortcomings.
Major players, such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Others, such as the blog platform WordPress will accept them.
Recently, FDI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel the Rechnungsbuch analysed and showed that nearly 80% of Bitcoins will not be in circulation.
In November, a “mega-Schlussverkauf”.
“Dreißigtausend dollars have been exchanged,” Holmquist, Jon is happy for the company, which operates Coinabul Bitcoins convertible into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book on this currency is, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as Transaktionsnetzwerk.
His system Paytunia corresponds with a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but using Bitcoin validation of the transactions that it is cheaper.
In addition, managed the holders of its identity and, therefore, can remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented the traders, and the latter have no new terminals or install programs.
They simply need to give an address, a phone “photographed and identified,” Pierre Noizat is the assurance that it has thousands of users.
It is a general trend seen in the hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontally oriented systems should be rethought.
“It will be some time before Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, the different today, as a highly respected risks in the event of a success of this currency to reassess.
We have withdrawn from the country.
And after that?
French troops have their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States should follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take ownership of their territory, and that the Afghan people to decide their future, without all of us to expect.

From the end of 2014, there will be no Einströmen more of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible march from 1994 to 1996, conditions changed.
At the time, Kabul was empty and the country due to the struggles of the various inflammatory groups from the war.
The coup was at that time as a kind of liberation and return to security.

You have traders turned in by land, the government seized them as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan to sell, and thus benefit from the massive american subcontracting.

As I have heard it in the campaigns, people want to see a government that is not from thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as those who take the american contributions to harness: the flight is significant.
The young people have tired of the war and its ideology.
During her exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, with one-fifth of the population.

Former commanders of the anti-soviet struggle are already making efforts to restore the militias in the province, which is the power of the central administration.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identities have of a certain degree of decentralisation, in the case of the western nations will benefit, but by abolishing the post of prime minister, which since the Constitution of the United States, in 1964, wanted to make him a centralised state with a strong Präsidialgewalt.
President Karzai does not want any foreign inspections, in particular at the 2014 elections planned for April.
However, his country since the 1950s and was already long dependent on foreign aid.

The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that the only western countries were on the ground in order to steal.
Without energy, iron or Kupfererz local processing, or without vehicles for export on the mountains of mining is not possible.
The Chinese have the Mes Aynak copper mine by already almost deserted, the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) on the vast Buddhist site their excavation and remain the biggest employers of the province.

A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily granted him the unlimited power, more divided than ever, he has decided to put everything in one basket.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly on the next day, its final version will pass.
Just over a week ago, the leader of the House, two additional months for completing its work.
Egypt is based now for almost two years on a provisional, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and a legal mess.
This new initiative only for an even stronger divisions in the country.
For his opponents, primarily the President in his autocratic “Delirium,” he continued to “break his word” and “the right underfoot.”
On the side of his supporters are receiving assurances that the road is the institutional and political crisis to an end as soon as possible and the transition process to be speeded up.
Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.
A very short period of time, the brothers who forces on their plan to forgo the Egyptians and the text of section for section to explain.
For the president, it is also a way of his public and democratic legitimacy, while protests raged across the country.
After you, in an interview with the american Wochenschau Mohamed Morsi Time seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
As the egyptian people with this recourse to a rushed vote an ultimatum: “either it is true for my draft or reserving the unlimited power”, the latter should after the adoption of the constitution supposedly come to an end.
85 largely islamist members of the Constituent Assembly, the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberal Democrats has not responded to the invitation.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, in mid-November, they have avoided, because they believe that they were not able to enforce their views.
Representatives of human rights groups, religious minorities or civil society alike have acted.
To reach the quorum were yesterday morning in 11 people, substitutes, added.
Some are very close to the Moslembrüdern.
It is not surprising that the article mostly passed unanimously.
The commentators found it entertaining, incidentally, that the only difference of opinion in the hour of the day … for the prayer was expressed, as some members of the panel believed that the Constituent Assembly Pendeluhr not exactly was.
The text, which yesterday evening has been adopted, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, all the attention, remains, after all, is identical to that of the constitution of 1971, and says that “the principles of sharia are the main source of law”.
The salafi parties for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped that the “principles” with “the rules” to replace a rigorous application, which had made it possible.
For the Islamists, is the fact that this article has not been changed, a testimony to their good will and for your respect for the other members of egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy”, say the liberals, this only as Propagandaschlag look.
They say that is because the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles.
They have in mind, particularly Article 220 of the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of compliance with the laws of the Sharia law.
According to the Ägyptenspezialistin Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because “the people who asked our opinion, will not have been elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals will also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of the university is far less moderate than it is at present.
“At the moment, no specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain in the context of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who had worked on this text, do not keep, but academics, some of which were trained in the french system,” soothed Blouet Alexis, a doctoral thesis on the egyptian Verfassungstransition writes.
But he admits that “in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity may be available, because the terms used the religious vocabulary borrows.
It relates in particular to the “islamic jurisprudence, Fiqh” [...] Red.
And in future, raised the question of to what extent Zivilrichter are competent to decide that.”
In addition to his religious aspect is the text adopted yesterday sharply criticized because of the far-reaching powers, of which he is the President of the Republic.
The Moslembrüder argue that this compared with the former regime are significantly reduced.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military will review the defence budget to Parliament, but not a National Defense Council.
Also, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights associations have called for.
The latter also share their fears in the text, which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, with serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
In addition, no article relates more to the protection of women, highlights Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, is the only positive aspect of the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
It was a word in the previous constitution not included.
While the egyptian president last night on television saying something, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The advocates of the Head of State will march Saturday.

“The great and powerful” leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While lawmakers and civil rights activist, discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants to be criminals already with fake certificates
Each year, 13 million migrant workers to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to pay for the maintenance of the home in the remaining families to earn.
On 1 December, a law that everyone working immigrant a test of knowledge of the russian language, must.
So far, the scheme for migrants in the services sector, in the local housing stock and want to work in the retail sector.
However, should the tests in time, according to federal Migrationsbehörde future for all workers to be compulsory.
It must not only language tests, but also tests in russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills, both for preserving and extending the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which language is Russian.
Also exempt from this legislation are people their Ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, and the protection of the rights issue
The entirety of the Prüfungsstellen will, under the aegis of the Pushkin-Institute for the russian language, the Russian's university, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other universities are russian.
The migrants can take the tests in all the cities, have already been in Russia already has more than 160 such centres open.
The initiative to introduce the tests by the members of the State Duma and the federal Migrationsbehörde supports.
Civil rights activist, on the other hand, prior to the entry into force of the law in the press several times to the following question: what does it really mean?
What changes does the obligatory language skills to show, both for the Russians and for guest workers?
Above all, say, spokesman for the Migrationsbehörde is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labour.
“Many are talking now about protecting the rights of migrant workers,” says the head of the representation of the federal Migrationsbehörde in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Your rights before their departure, however, must be protected.
Only an organized recruitment is 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Confronted with problems of migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future without migrant language skills, inevitably, people with bad intentions will encounter him, under the pretext of aid in the dark, narrow shack, where he met dozens of his ilk months without food and documents to stay and 12 to 14 hours a day of cronies.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
“The home is one thing you promised, and upon arrival, you cheated to get their passports taken and do not receive the promised pay”, confirmed that the head of the headquarters for migration, the Tajik Migrationsbehörde Tolib Schwaripow.
Not having a go, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who earn their money, not just that they do not speak the language of the destination, but also in their own language can hardly express in writing.
Of course this is not their fault, rather than the evil: only a few of the Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks, too, can only afford a decent education.
Because in their families are not even money to feed the children, let alone to them a decent clothing, footwear and Schulsachen to buy.
As a teenager to take these children to the first opportunity to make money.
“It is difficult without language skills,” they said.
“You fühlst you humiliated and inferior.”
Civil rights activists say the law regarding the following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
You have this status, so there is no investigation and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers remain illegal in Russia.
“Warmly welcome” or “entry of unauthorised persons banned”
Many migrants to confirm that it is not easy to Russia in an official status.
Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
It also costs money: the legalization of 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
Fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the russian police know that our largely fabricated documents and we are not registered, and then there are cases of extortion.
“You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea”, is the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
“Just no cost for false papers shy”
Earlier in the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only was the Registrierungsdokumente migrants can be forged.
Some counterfeit certificates, which the completion of the language tests have already been telling staff the federal Migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary Farbdrucker.
Naturally, the new owners are not in vain: each migrant who hoped that such tests can save, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that not just the certificates can be bought, are both officials and civil rights activist, agreed.
For the moment, the public authorities can immigrant workers, the first time through the test, only promise that it is time for a Sprachgrundkurs.
There will also be new arrivals without knowledge of languages offered posts in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
Interior Ministry ignored illegal arms market
Share of legal weapons to extremely low crime
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to tighten up the Waffengesetzes for private Waffenbesitzer.
So the authorities respond to recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the chaos of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to wear a non-lethal weapons in public ban and the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 increase.
The proposal, the chairman of the State Duma Committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes to the Arms Act shortly will be submitted to the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the russian authorities of the problems with “attraction of the screws” trying to fight.
On the Internet, published an open letter, the author-representatives of various Waffenverbände-demand that the authorities of “futile” clamps to refrain.
The percent of the crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian Service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crime with application of registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while in the same period, a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private Waffenbesitzer criminals will not prevent, on the black market.
Now, one of the authors, according to Moscow in every possible weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior said that the proliferation of illegal guns is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons through several channels on the black market.
There are five main channels such, told a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, 10 years in the Department of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts Waffenbestellungen
The first channel is the army or the military, i. e., the weapons during the fighting in the Caucasus have been stolen.
“The weapons were both by the russian military officers, as well as the people themselves,” says Baranez stolen.
The second channel is illegal weapons, the vigilante of criminals are stolen.
Baranez explained that these weapons count, both from the armouries police and staff directly from the law enforcement agencies have been stolen.
Further illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals.
Many Militärlagern came to explosions.
“There is evidence that some cases of arson, the lack of weapons to cover up,” says the former military personnel.
A contribution to the black market in accordance with Baranez also make the arms manufacturers.
“Nowadays there are countless private Rüstungsfabriken, the international competition and therefore does not meet the weapons under the hands on the black market, some in Moscow to dump,” reported the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a distinct, sometimes small-scale production, as well as a mafia, the smuggling organization,” explained the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts have calculated what percentage of each of the five channels in the supplying of black market with illegal arms around.
In 2011, a report by the Centre for Problemanalysen and state administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the federal service for government statistics, forensic literature and publicly available data on portals on the issue of weapons.
The overwhelming majority of illegal arms comes to investigators, according to the army and the Rechtsschutzbehörden.
Half of all the weapons on the black market are going through “the blame from those who, in their work with weapons have reached,” the report states.
The data, according to the researchers from 17% of the weapons from conflict zones, 14% of theft in the arms industry, and 5% comes from illegal excavation.
A Verkaufsberater Waffenladens one, which did not name who wants to be assured that weapons from illegal excavation to be found, for a long time, no one is buying, as they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more likely that retailers are the supply routes in a weapons cache.
On a Fähnrich is a weapon, for example, a gun-type TT, bought.
The weapon will be issued and through the fence.
“The dealer is bringing the weapon into the city and sold them for 900 euros a piece with two magazines,” he told
“The police know of course in everything and, therefore, if the plan for the detection of crime cannot fulfil periodically Kontrollkäufe dealers by illegal weapons offer”, adds the Verkaufsberater added.
“As the Luxusladen”
Buyers and sellers find most about knew each other.
I had my websites and blogs, seen as someone who was on me, and I suggested to the station “Begowaja” come to where a person in I would wait for me in a certain place, where we could negotiate the price.
The price for the only weapon I learned there
Viktor Baranez Militärkommentator
“In order to get a weapon, I need an acquaintance, contacts,” told the Verkaufsberater. “I have as a friend, but I trust him.”
There are traders in the markets, but you have to have a go and have agreed on how “code of Ivan Iwanowitsch, the host, the daughter of a tooth has lost.”
I am now even some Schlagringe about an acquaintance that I trust.
It gives me the Schlagringe also only because he knows he has not verpfeife.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in various ways.
The former military personnel Viktor Baranez tried, in the mid-1990's as buyers of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this topic.
According to him, the scheme has not changed.
He got a Fotoalbum, in which “everything possible” portrait.
“I felt like the Luxusladen,” recalls the military personnel.
The buyer gets loud Baranez not a pig in a poke, but everything can try them out.
I buy a potential customer is not simply, but ride a seller in the forest, and that is where we have a target on.
“I can shoot it there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other,” describes the expert's action.
Shopping from the sofa
Internetsuchmaschinen show search to websites and groups in “Vkontakte,” where weapons “for various purposes”.
It will not need any papers still there is personal meeting.
“You need just the right amount of money,” it says in the Werbeanzeige on the website “Kampfpistole or buy guns.”
There, users on your orders and ask questions.
Will also be sold to minors?
“Of course, without a licence,” asks users “Ivan” (direct quote).
“A TT Kaufe. Moscow” is the question of “noncommitted Fedorenkow.”
The federal security services stepped in recently, and countless Scheinwebseiten buyers, the weapons are wanting to buy the service are crowding into the network.
The people are like hungry fish for feeding and then end up in Siberia, and digging coal
Viktor Baranez Militärkommentator and former soldiers
I have heard of the scheme: the website is normally registered abroad, and russian laws are not applied.
The leaders of the orders.
The buyer to transfer the money on an ATM machines.
“The response he receives a photo and a description of the Verstecks the weapon,” reported the official press, the non-profit organization “na Pravo oryzhie Dmitry Kislow.”
Viktor Baranez insisted that we finally also left empty-handed and behind bars can be, if you asked a question on a web page placement.
The federal security services stepped in recently, and countless Scheinwebseiten buyers, the weapons are wanting to buy the service are crowding into the network.
“People are like hungry fish for feeding and then end up in the siberian labour camp, and digging coal,” he says.
A Makarow for $100
With the purchase of illegal firearms, according to the experts, with prices of 100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislow by “na Pravo oryzhie” can be a gun-type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars buy.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is in military arsenals of overseers middle-ranking spent.
The Interior Ministry, according to the official statistics, the number of offences with illegal weapons across Russia in the period from January to October 2011 to 7% 22,9 thousand, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion in connection with arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices to 7.8% shrank.
In the US strike fast-food and supermarket-employees
One in four american adolescents sits at some point behind the coffers of McDonald's
In the last few days there was in the United States to massive protests against low wages in Walmart stores of popular restaurants and fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests will continue to grow or whether they will soon regain the steam.
The protests by trade unions and left-wing several non-profit organizations.
In addition to the increase of the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers monitor the organizers of the protests which aim to form trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized.
46 cents in a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, the sale took place in the United States, the millions of customers anlockten, which sometimes led to Handgemengen.
On this day, some Walmart workers, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which is targeted at low-and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products of nappies on Jagdgewehre and batteries to Staubsaugern, eggs and milk.
The products in Walmart stores-is, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Why buy many of the slightly paid Walmart employees-only at their workplace.
The prices and the Walmart made close to one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics say the commodity Walmart can often only as good sell, because the staff are paid poorly.
The latter also complain about serious conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or Handscanner.
Participants in the protest on “Black Friday” demanding wage increases, and they expressed their anger about the contribution for health insurance betriebseigene from 30 to 100 dollars per month had increased.
A typical Walmart workers, the US dollar 9.5 hour earns, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, show that if the company's average wage increases to 12 dollars an hour, Walmart 3.2 billion dollars it would cost.
That is around 1.1% more than they now pay for donations.
Walmart would complete the wage increases to the customers to pass on any future purchase cost only 46 cents more.
Each year, which for them compared to now an additional cost of only 12,39 dollars.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only in nine states to protests, and no losses for the company.
The Black Friday took in his shop at 8 p. m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that period, Walmart sold roughly 5,000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart-coffers on “Black Friday” nearly 100 million transactions.
The spokesman for the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that overall, “less than five” Walmart workers laid down the work and the protest only “another PR stunt” of the union, organised the protests.
“Free cash!”
The protests were this week in New York, where their objective but not-Walmart stores (which in this progressive city not wanted and there are non-existent), but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billions of chickens, and yet it gives you no sick days, and it will not pay for your honest work.
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage in accordance with federal and New York law at $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage and gradually increased, but not too much, and on average get their simple staff in New York 8,90 dollars an hour.
Less than they deserve, no one in this expensive city.
How is it possible, in New York, with as little money as possible, is beyond me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all american young people after school at McDonald's, behind the Theke was, however, young people are still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw in that the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now I encounter in interviews with staff of McDonald's always people who complain that they pay with this and sometimes even their children have to feed.
On the other hand there are in the forum of the Wall Street Journal, a newspaper commentary, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if it did not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protest, which on Thursday at 6.00 a. m. before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, began demanding that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They have asked to continue the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US law prohibits it, corporate governance, this goal to stand in the way of union members and abzumahnen or redundant.
On the other hand, the management of them is not easy.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry, but also for objective reasons difficult.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
A noisy protest on this day, there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was an assembly of the afternoon before the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including deputy mayors Jumaane Williams, who said: “McDonald's says it sell billion pieces, and yet it gives you no sick days, and it will not pay for your honest work!”
The demonstrators were also by other prominent New York Democrats supported, for example, Bürgermeisterkandidat Bill de Blasio, who said that “we should share the fast-food workers so that they receive a fair wage and economic prosperity can achieve, which each New York deserves!”.
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred local people who, by far, not everyone in the fast-food industry, in the work of tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole masses.
“The brain is so far only moderately outsmart”
When supporters of modern technologies loves the enlarged reality in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses.
Google first showcased in the summer in its annual conference a working model, in November was then known, also a Microsoft patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3d technology in Microsoft's laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a Durchgangsstation.
You are tempted by the opportunity, virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate virtual belts.
- You briefly describe what your research group.
We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, the humanity in the stage largely stuck in the back with Pixeln at work, sometimes.
However, we want to look ahead, 5-10 years and the radical changes of this interaction anticipate.
For example, the Xbox and the Kinect-Konsole sensors-a step forward, and today will be no more Xbox Kinect sold without, since all interested for movement.
What awaits us in the future?
Kinect-although the interaction on a physical level, plays a great deal still on the Flachbildschirm, sometimes in 3D.
The submission of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet decisive.
We are trying to change, working in a real three-dimensional Darstellungssystemen on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We need the Computerwelt in our physical world redundant and intelligible.
To this end, it is imperative that not only the user, but also its surroundings will be recognised.
We could then the real world much easier by virtual objects.
First and foremost we should these bescheuerten virtual-reality-helmets be rid of!
What do you think about Sprachsteuerung?
It is popular, but it is not overvalued?
And it is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, because it raises questions about privacy, because it is not always possible to all others about his actions and intentions would like to inform.
In fact, any sort of interaction with computers, but any good in their particular niche.
For example, we were in the area of managing properties in public places in a project for which short and tight, rather than experimenting with sprawling gestures.
The gestures were not from the Objektkamera, but by a bracelet, which recorded the movements of the bones and muscles were registered.
Still, it is relatively large, could in theory, however, about the size of a wristwatch will be reduced.
But overall the future belongs to, for example, however, mixed Steuerungstypen Gestik and language.
As this?
- We would like for example I ask you this Sprudeldose too rich?
You say it, and at the same time point.
Normally I say it simply.
Oh, that would be very difficult to see.
And this means that they want the user to adjust to what a machine at the relevant time can make and what is not?
Not necessarily, but it is a convergence.
I believe that in the near future, particularly in the development of new types of work, which will enable more accurate responses of individuals.
This could, for example, be Lasersensoren, as they are in the depths of a good offer, which is very important.
- Which claims are you based on your work with the Xbox Kinect-sensors to modern cameras?
There is a lack of depth of dissolution, or something else?
The present generation is, in fact, a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 Megapixel with a speed of 1,000 fps not bad.
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality and the depth of the matrix.
All current technologies are seen as not good enough for us, as the designer of the algorithms more work.
Not only must the dissolution of along the X-and Y-but also along the Z-axis are taken into account.
And the speed and the number of images per second are important.
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic, and to be honest, the current 30 fps especially for little gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond with a Berührungssensor regulierbaren Verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1-100 milli-seconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much the interaction of man and machine.
In my work I needed just such a device, only without Berührungssteuerung and with more images per second.
The number of cameras-should not be increased?
Kinect-is currently working with three “cameras”, but one of them is actually a Infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
And the third is actually an ordinary RGB camera-camera.
It is not used to calculate the Objekttiefe.
More cameras could solve the problem …
Or the problem as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible Kinect-like system in which we could play with various Kameraneigungen in order to find out how, during the investigation of a three-dimensional position helps.
If I remember correctly, in contrast to Google, Microsoft showcased his glasses, not the public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in the everyday life of the lens of the best prospects?
And of course it is not pleasant, always a smart phone in the collected, but I think the following: the tollste formula would be a “rotation” of enhanced reality, in which we have a cloud of the lens to the smart phone could change our tune
The lens is a personal gadget is its strength and personal matters (only you can see), but also their weakness, because a larger reality through glasses, along with others in virtual objects can work.
Let us, for a moment, that the manipulation of virtual Hologramme in the air not only Tony Stark in Iron, but rest is accessible.
There is a problem of this idea critics often point out that there are no visible reaction.
The hands felt nothing!
What answers to your group at this point?
In my classes, I often talk about the reality of the enlarged seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of taktilen perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of second-hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage.
It takes pressure perfectly true.
There are also technologies that actually the images “in the air” something concrete, for example, produces the collision of some Ultraschallstrahlen directed at a certain point where the finger, a feeling that, at the moment, but still so weak, as someone on the pustete Handballen.
There are bands for the Council on the nerve endings detect in the fingers of influence, which is also a potential direction.
Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
This way of thinking that it feels, what it should feel when something looks?
That is a good idea, so we have not yet tried.
Here lies another task to which we still have to struggle, that is, a man who is physically in a closed room is located, to believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here, we are working on ideas with Laufbändern (other than in Fitnessstudios), mobile platforms and large bullets.
So far, the brain only moderately outflank and we still have many years of hard work.
This just makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher appeal: on many issues we are only at the beginning.
My own taste instead of culture-rosbalt. ru
Rosbalt, the project “Petersburg avant-garde” continues, the city is devoted to the art and culture of the avant-garde.
On the select list ended up already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg Kunstszene, whose achievements beyond the borders of the city and the often recognition in Europe, without the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt, the flamboyant artists Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the red-clad Bärtigen the times at the Russian Museum, to Sommergarten, sometimes on-scene meetings or on Vernissagen around them.
Where are the images of Kirill Miller also is issued, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and sent by his presence on the street, its citizens a smile to the face and provides them with good humour.
Recently, he grabbed a Drehorgel and became the Petersburg Drehorgelspieler, as it is for this difficult role in relation to be Künstlerdasein, his philosophy and his image finally felt ready.
Kirill-why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the town of travel?
I have red as fashion designers, who was elected with the optics and image.
In this world of red is the compromise between artists, spin-doctors and society.
In the society calls on everything that something of the Graunorm differs, aggression and bad behaviour.
But I want to use my provocations with the people.
Any of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
When wusstest you, that you must be painter?
In an exhibition in the Moscow theatre Newskij, in my work were issued.
I realised that I have to go down this road.
Then there was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter at the time, to the end, and new and free painters as I was incomprehensible.
I am friendly with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the “Gazonewschina”; hence, “Puschkinskaja 10”, and then that was just concluded.
It prefers me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything except the literature.
And all of the united in your kind-clinic … it was important to me that at the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a space in the Puschkinskaja 10 and there was up to the renovation of a musical, artistic club for the Boheme, the home of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O. M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember how string with his project “Ucho Van Goga” there.
String and his friends sing simple songs to play-back, wearing tight jersey was one of them, and also the composer Igor Wdowin edgy today.
As the group began to play, was broadcast live from their “Leningrad”.
Trachtenberg facilitated many programmes before the days of “Halli-Galli.”
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his career, but the foundations he moved with us.
The gallery 137 “D” or the “club” Griboedov have their origin in-clinic.
There, our staff and Stammgäste.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000 there was a poll in the press, where the award “personalities of our city”.
I won in the category of “artist of the year”, and that it was me on.
It is not easy in new times under old rules to work; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
At the present time, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be known without a cultural contribution.
Your work-have a distinctive style.
Many of my pictures are real pearls and make clear the timeliness and sharpness of thought.
I am an exhibition on the theme of “the Russian Museum as a clown”.
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier, I was socially, but now it pains and causing fear, to be like this.
In a clown blur it all and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have the bizarre ideas.
For example, we save the world by requiring everyone to dress up in full.
Now respects everyone on the clothes and is based on looks and not at the heart of the people.
But perhaps we should not give a person, but should he spit in the face.
The deception by Verkleiden disappears.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the urban Drehorgelspielers. - a City should, as a hero.
Who, if not me?
Commercial art-can also be beautiful?
These days, commercial art-cautious, respectful and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
Previously, large groups of people: the Bohemiens loved one and the ordinary people of the other.
Now there are Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am no Einhundert-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you must think about you, whom you'll have fallen.
Now, every Kultstar around 100 supporters.
The appearances by Stas Michailow but several thousand.
And him to be deserted women, is the location of the sexually-social world.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less money management, and everything is based.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and what we have achieved, not destroy it.
In my youth I have such pictures painted by a collector, even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images that are normally only at the end of the career.
Today, there are often misunderstood.
It means: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has absolutely no culture, which is something very different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists on, impoverished and died in poverty and money refused to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
Petersburg-Kirill, what is missing?
- Good cultural experts.
We say: servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real czar was different, because the tsars understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what the experts might be, but they are barred because it hochrangigerer experts, of the need for the former properly evaluate them and open the way.
Now counts only their own taste.
The same is true for the Erarta, however, with the difference that they honestly say that they do not all contemporary art and a number of painters, therefore, other museums must seek.
Petersburg-which is for you?
Petersburg-is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow; there is a lot more culture and a suitable breeding ground.
On our stones can art is difficult to grow up.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are many people who are curious exhibitions or concerts.
In the us are much less.
Art needs to be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be paid from the city of St Petersburg financed
Born in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or clash with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with Erdbewohnern on board are seeking a Ersatzplaneten.
In order to save humanity, is a major issue, as we in the zero gravity or the Ersatzplaneten breed?
There are many choices in my opinion, no.
In fact there are only two real planet we inhabit could at least hypothetical.
Nämlich “Mars and Venus”, says the scientific staff of the astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on mars, there is comparatively enjoyable on the surface of Venus, a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life is only in height or in the orbit of Venus, therefore, possible in space.
The issue of reproduction in space, the researchers treated first with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before, experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of the in-orbit different varieties of peas, not in the slightest by the earthly species.
What followed was the creation of insects, tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979 Wachteleier were sent to outer space to explore how the zero gravity on the development of embryos.
It is developing a normal chicks.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that the chickens must be stopped; it needs to be on his legs and can begin to move,” explained the laboratory officials of the Institute for medical and biological problems Ran, Vladimir Sychew.
Without deep underground, the chicks have been falling in the wild.
Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn.
The chicks were not reacting to light and-like.
Four days later they died off.
“We left Zweimal chicks slip, and then the whole thing, because it is simply impossible, to work with them,” Vladimir Sychew considers the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last Brutkäfig with animals flew 16 years in orbit.
In the spring of 2013, will continue the experiments.
However, on the “same-sex” Biosatelliten Bion only species.
There was an experiment with rats, which already fertilized, were sent into space.
In principle, it was anything special.
“That was just the Biosatelliten, but once again it was only a single experiment, and the research must continue,” said Vladimir Sychew.
After landing, the Weltraumratten offspring.
The issue of reproduction directly in space could have not so far been resolved.
The task is difficult.
The animals from their natural habitats can simply be taken their Fortpflanzungstrieb not follow.
In contrast to the man the animals could in principle.
Homo sapiens is thinking abstraktem capable and can produce a similar emotional backdrop.
For ethical considerations are not carried out such experiments.
But women fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk of Tereshkova.
The Wertvollste that mankind is the female body.
Our Möwe flew, and no one on earth would answer the following question: can it weathers the Weltraumflug?
After this flight, it will bring a child into the world?
“After all, nobody answered that question,” says Raumfahrtveteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after its Weltraumflug, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The child's father, was also Andrijan Nikolajew militiamen.
In 1988, is the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, which twice in orbit was, and even if they work outside the Raumfahrzeugs, a son.
Nevertheless, it remains a risk.
We have extremely few cosmonaut, after long flights in which everything went well and healthy offspring.
“The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit,” concludes militiamen Valery Poliakov quite rightly, hero, hero of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation.
And yet, the race for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the artificial Erzeugen Gravitation.
The Hydrolabor Vorbereitungszentrum in the cosmonaut is mandatory at the station to perform.
Here, in a state of flux, winning the cosmonaut routine for the work in the open space.
The water is the zero gravity.
Although adult water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment, but babies feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander witness to that life in the country rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it was easier to water used.
In principle this is logical, as from birth until the first swimming just 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little time to forget,” says Marina Babyschwimmlehrerin Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child the zero gravity is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In a state of zero gravity, the belly and Beckenmuskulatur enormous speed back, and thus the ability to extract the baby.
Okay, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool.
The birth could, for example, in a Spezialkammer held to the child of squeezing.
“But what happens then?” is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poliakov quite rightly.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the Erdanziehung to feel, the organism the skeleton and muscles do not train.
A newborn baby is in orbit, not as an adult to train in a Belastungsanzug.
It is simply the lack of what his life is of fundamental importance.
“This experiment, which together we make, the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to a disabled, a completely unangepassten people will bring to the world,” says the head of the Institute for Bioethikkommission medical and biological problems Ran, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space, mere theory.
At some point, but the reality of it, if the people in their spacecraft to a distant planet, head of the home for their offspring born in space.
NKÚ chief: control of the black-and-system failed by fault of the policy
The Czech Republic, in connection with public contracts on good inspection and adequate laws, but in its application.
In the conversation for Aktuálně. cz says that the Vice-President of the highest Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav kala.
“A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied right-and I think that this is not the case,” kala commented on the current situation.
A similar result is apparently a common control by czech and german investigators.
But a negative Praxisbeispiel leading the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas, on the so-called “black” system.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls would not bite, the system is now banned or permitted?
“A law, but its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the Regierungsvorsitzende come from, and this one, whose duty is to monitoring the implementation of the law is in its work, hinder,” kala.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a common Czech-german project, in which the laws of both countries in terms of public contracts compared with each other.
What did it mean?
It is the result of a parallel investigation with which we have started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is important to ensure that the european legislature to decide how to handle public contracts are to build the national legislation, and finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this we have compared with each other, and even though the investigation has not yet been completed, we have very interesting differences, generally speaking, are the laws we are perhaps even more “strict and perfect,” the actual application, however, is in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more precise rules we must also address the actual implementation of the law.
How can you help the project? what is for you from this project?
Just such a common control could help that we stop us constantly to perfecting the laws and the reduction and balance of thresholds to try, if it is apparently not particularly positive.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) and illegal enrichment or even criminal actions.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this objective.
It may even be that the system in this way only with “excessive” paperwork burden on those who look for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, rather than the higher thresholds.
You talk about the problems in the practical application of the Czech Vergabegesetzes.
How the system works in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, it is the german equivalent to the NKÚ the General Accounting Office, the similarly structured is like us, and also on a college, which is only slightly different. both authorities, however, similar in principle.
The powers are to a certain extent comparable, with Germany, however, is a federal state, i. e. that it is these courts in individual states-is what distinguishes the german system of our.
The only federal funding BRH cannot control what our government funds.
Public funds in the us from the districts and municipalities are managed there are subject to the control of the let.
What the german legislation, it is easier than ours?
In general I would do this without any concrete data to compare, but Germany is, in some ways, often described as a model, but certainly not to say that Germany in particular is better.
This is perhaps because the auditors are better?
Certainly not, but, as I said, such comparisons may not particularly like.
This is to note that even those countries which, for us, is a model, are also struggling with problems to have.
Otherwise, they would have nothing to work with our authority, is it not?
What the czech legislation, what was important for your authority to review the Vergabegesetzes, feel they have any impact?
Given that this novella in force for only a short time, in our tests, it is still not enough.
Since our checks subsequently take place, it must be here with some delay.
We feel so far more impact in the phase of future controls – as we have new control “hazard” introduced the inefficiency and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed-you will see the changes, of course, because the thresholds to change the conditions for certain types of alerts modified and others.
You can see the adoption of this law is more positive, or will the system with more red tape?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, there is the problem that the rules “strict” and no longer can be met.
Under the previous rules, a test unterzogenen persons against the winner (for example, in the event of an operational program of regional policy, the regional council) accountable for any breach of the Vergabegesetzes a breach of discipline.
Is it useful, however, the law is even tougher to make?
I do not believe in this way.
The system has to exclude those who want to abuse the system and attacking, not penalise those who have committed a mistake on the real decision making.
Such a system, only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
We say, first of all, what is not successful.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called “black-and-system” - although what exactly does this mean?
Is the black-and-system now banned or permitted?
A law, but its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the Regierungsvorsitzende come from, and this one, whose duty is to monitoring the implementation of the law is, in his work.
He can say: “we change the law and allow the thing,” but he could not say that we act as if nothing had happened.
The Vergabegesetz contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions-and this is for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer alone due to procedural irregularities.
The law is never perfect, but it needs to be properly applied and that is what I think is missing.
On the streets there is occasionally Eisglätte, mostly, however, they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic is partly snow and Eisglätte.
Mostly, however, the streets are used as well, sometimes, increased caution.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad were the streets this morning, good condition, occasionally there was snow and Eisglätte.
Temperatures fell to-5 to-10 ° C, it should be slightly warmer during the day.
In the region it is snowing now no longer and deeper in the altitudes remains only a thin snow cover.
At the time, however, the Kämmen Erzgebirges about 30 cm of snow.
According to the Bezirksstraßenwacht was limited because of fog.
The highway R6 and the routes of the first Straßenklasse in the region are now fully navigable.
Attention is, however, for example, on bridges, on which the lanes sometimes frozen and smooth.
All routes are also used as the second and third Straßenklasse, including Bergstraßen.
On these roads, however, section by section vereiste or ausgefahrene Schneereste.
Especially in the higher positions is therefore increased attention.
Counties and Pardubice Hradec Králové
On some roads Ostböhmens Eisglätte risk due to higher locations and in the mountains, on the streets, sometimes even a ausgefahrene Schneeschicht, shares the road and Autobahndirektion on their websites.
The Straßenmeistereien warn drivers against Eisglätte, especially in higher positions in the district of Pardubice can occur.
To Eisglätte there can, particularly on routes in the second and third in the circles, Straßenklasse Lanškroun Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The streets I / 43 / 1 and 34 in Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow, particularly on the streets and in the mountains in the Giant Mountains Orlické hory.
A ausgefahrene Schneeschicht lies in altitudes in the streets of the circles Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Ostböhmen it is now mostly sunny and pleasant, and it remains largely niederschlagsfrei.
Temperatures range from-3 and + 1 ° C, it is a weak wind.
District Pilsen
The roads in the district of Pilsen today are used as well, locally, however, is increased attention, and the driving is to adapt to the weather.
On the morning of this chilly, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Because it has snowed and temperatures fell, then it can on the streets to Eisglätte.
Local is also with fog, with the point of view, however, the day will improve.
These data come from the Bezirksstraßenmeistereien.
The motorway d5 is virtually fully navigable, increased attention, however, recommend the Straßenmeistereien between 80 and 131 miles...
The lanes of the first Straßenklasse are mostly dry, but durchgefroren.
In the south of the Pilsen and Tachov circles, however, it can come to Eisglätte section by section.
The lanes of the second and third Straßenklasse are wet, and therefore also applies here, the reference to possible vereiste sections.
Drivers should mainly on the less used roads in the area of Bohemian Forest to be particularly careful.
Olomouc district
With Schneematsch drivers must now count towards the altitudes in the district of Olomouc.
Following the use of Streufahrzeugen Schneematsch remains on the passport Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nächtliches Schneetreiben Straßenmeistereien forced to use, in the district of Šumperk fell, according to the management about 3 cm Neuschnee.
In the other areas of the region, the lanes usually fully navigable.
“In the circle Šumperk Schneereste still remain at high altitudes.
On the passport Červenohorské sedlo drivers have to reckon with in the direction of Jeseník Schneematsch,” said a member of the management Šumperk today to the Agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in the circle Jeseník had during the night, according to its data, the roads until the altitudes after chemical treatments freely and wet.
In the district of Olomouc's roads are fully navigable, in the district of Šternberk drivers have to drive cautiously Waldabschnitten, however, since this is where the lanes are still wet.
District Ústí nad Labem, Liberec district
In northern Bohemia, report the Straßenmeistereien several bad navigable sections.
In addition to several places with snow or Eisglätte is the mountain road from Telnice after Knínice in circles Ústí N.K. according to the traffic police closed off.
Temperatures will also remain deep enough below zero, so that the snow and ice on the roads will be drawn from the south east by the bohemian Tiefebenen, particularly in mountainous areas, reported no problems, and the roads are usually dry.
So far there have been no Verkehrsstörungen reported.
Eisglätte, particularly from the radius of Štětí reported.
According to meteorologists have there been ideal conditions in the night-the day of rain and melting snow in the night sky wolkenloser and frost.
Of the major arteries, and on the road I / 13 on the border of the districts Ústí N.L. and Liberec be bad traffic conditions reported.
The closure of the road between Telnice Knínice because of branches and was required by the Schneelast pushed on to the tarmac.
Šimon Ornest: on our concerts, we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month, the end of the world is to take place?
This is one of those cries to the people, we are so happy to start up again.
With our band the Tap Tap make us more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to the end of the world to stop or prevent.
In December, you also create a unique project with three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide Benefizveranstaltung that we have two years to plan.
For this, we want to make use of the mayan calendar Marketingpotenzial whose end on 21 December at 11: 10 a. m. forecast.
The day before, i. e. on 20 December, from 21: 00 p. m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts to be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which in a time zone for 12 hours before us, the mayan calendar ends.
This idea comes from whom?
Originally from me, then we have the idea together with our Grafiker Honza Augusta.
We would like to not only sufficient positive energy, the end of the world, but also with the public to think about the state of this world to our children.
At the end of the mayan calendar, we also have a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and Schlüsselanhängern against the end of the world, with a purchase on www. e-tap. cz people also can support.
The band the Tap Tap has joined with other performers also known as the anthem for the end of the world with the title “Weltuntergang comes from”.
Already today, the anthem on YouTube in. it is also the Benefizkonzerten ring out?
Of course, and in the end, provided that all work and the end of the world is not taking place …
The anthem should by all the performers in all three concerts at the same time be sung.
In addition, the hymns together in a Direktschaltung by Czech Television broadcast live.
The text of the anthem of Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, also plays Xindl X sings with …
How are you working with both?
We also cooperate with other figures in the Czech Kulturszene associated with that, that we have many Benefizveranstaltungen concerts and realize …
We try to these people hard in our projects.
It has been shown that most interest in working with us, and to have fun.
What is the purpose of the proceeds benefit concerts for the end of the world?
For the establishment of the seamless Bildungszentrums Studeo, on which we are already six years together with the club in the Tap Jedlička Institute.
The students are regularly Jedlička Institute of teachers who cared for them in different leisure activities help.
As the pupils themselves do not have the resources to do the teachers go, we would like to help them in this way.
In the completion of the Jedlička Institute to a separate buildings, in which we then with this project.
At every concert, several groups and performers.
What criteria do you have these selected?
We wanted a programme together, all the generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, enter Chinaski, Support Lesbiens Illustratosphere Bárta, with Dan, the Tap, Tap Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Everything else you hear on the website www. kpks. cz.
Similar “events” are also planned for the future?
In May, we are for the first time of the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we had been in the United States would also like to appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your Auslandspläne are not just small, yet you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How you deal with these visits logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it appears at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i. e. the wheelchairs must be transported in Gepäckraum. we must also, of course, many other mitschleppen Instrumentenkoffer and luggage …
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I sometimes already part was surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your foreign trips, you have a comparison, as in the various countries with accessibility is, how they deal with disabled people, and so on.
How have you seen these things so far?
After Luxembourg, Madrid, London and other cities where everything works better than us, we were just in Russia that witnesses in the East, everything still in its early days.
In Moscow, Prague is absolutely not accessible. there it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair is travelling alone in the city centre.
It is not even there, of course, that there is a wheelchair user, for example, in the lift vorlässt.
Fortunately there are also clubs that try to address the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we have to tell the more developed countries catch up?
There are still many things on which we depend on later …
It is, however, that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of the people affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities self-employed in the public space, into a museum, toilets can use, etc.
But it is not usual that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in the public arena, we are in with the band the Tap Tap slightly ahead of the West.
Public respect and removal is one thing, but only when our ranks from major athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really start to change.
So far there have been only isolated cases of particularly willensstarken personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but if we go back a couple of years: what have you in 1998, motivated to start a band?
At the time I began as carers in Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in with something very hard to do.
And since I am and musicians including Saxofon plays, I, together with a colleague a music company was founded.
Oh, and with time, as our host, Láďa Angelovič, say, a little out of control (laughs).
The band became known, but only in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped; in addition, we have begun to actively for us to promote.
We are aware that, if one does something and it does not see the merit in some sense, does not exist.
Thanks to EU aid, we can also good teachers, high-quality equipment, etc..
It was your objective, with the Tap Tap so far?
From the beginning, I have the potential, I felt that things in a different way.
The branch is now often copied one of the other.
That is, in his way, logical, because everything is new, taken with caution and take longer to be accepted.
There are few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of the spectators usually has, of course, compassion, of course; this is just …
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities not lonely and abandoned nature, which we regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, as long as they have the funds to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities, some manage to do it not just for themselves is a step forward, but for the whole of society.
It was also helpful for this success, that you are a tough boss, how many people listening?
If you want to make something good, we must not compromise on many things, and also has a certain discipline.
I think this is completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic notions, and if they see that they have tested twice a week, stages of preparation to study and spend a lot of time on, sponsoring concert tours, then extinguished the enthusiasm among many quickly.
So it works but everywhere, in every band who work hard and achieve something.
Currently, the Tap Tap 20 members.
How many of them were from the beginning, i. e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group: people come and go: this cannot be prevented.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to by “coming on board”, we always welcome.

Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was at a meeting with him of the member states of the European Space Agency (ESA) as a twentieth member of this space. Poland is the second member of the former Eastern bloc countries (in the Czech Republic, on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994 of close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years in several ESA projects.
The path of Poland in the space, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, the Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with space, so that it is not always met on understanding.
I refer, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author of ideas from his pioneering “entrance to Kosmonautik presented.”
The ideas of the young engineer (another 1905.) left the audience, however, cold, and after years of recalled Šternfeld yet that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the 1934 “year for entrance to the Kosmonautik” by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André delivered Prix RDP-Louis Hirsch Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
In polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis internationally recognised contribution to the development of space was by acknowledged that one of the crater erdabgewandten on the side of the moon has been named after him.
Earlier in the year was 1925 in Poland to a railway-building, for which a Draisine Raketenantrieb was planned.
The author of the proposal and the details of this project is unfortunately remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket or the brakes are activated the Draisine should be used.
The data come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, began the polish infantry, with raketenbetriebenen shells.
The research led the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents that the research stage to the practical test was developed.
The research was then, but by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht suspended.
In 1937, appeared in the press by Ing. Rohoziński originating fotoelektrischen Jagdrakete on draft, and the following year was the work of “Rakieta-torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza” the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealing with the military use of Raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war, all the projects for military use of missile technology from temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy) - coordinated.
The committee was set up in 1937, after two years of work was his work, however, by the war ended.
Other articles on space travel appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the polish press.
The first mention of this society is in the 1954 Novemberausgabe Problemy magazine, in which four long articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to create a Raumfahrtgesellschaft.
At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the future of space exploration.
At its inception in 1956 to the polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA to accede to the 1951 founded International Federation for space and, in fact, the PTA is already in the fall of 1956 ordinary member.
The following year, the first chairman of the PTA-Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), vice-chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
In this role he had, until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 played the PTA was instrumental in the development of the very successful missile (meteorological Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start came on 10 October 1958.
The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 feet long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1a, built in 1959 and began in the desert with the Błędów-Flugtests Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development should already be capable of real scientific work to make the missile-RM-34 to an altitude of up to 14.5 km and reach for the observation of Höhenwinden are in use.
In 1962, however, was the further development.
The first rocket-type RM was in the years 1962 to 1965 developed Meteor-1 rocket.
The missile was conceived as a Zweistufenrakete, their overall length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
Of these, three types of missile developed (Meteor-1A, 1B-and-1c states), which are the size of Transportraums for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1a missile had a transport with 0.4 5 litres, Meteor-1b on 0,34 litres and Meteor-1c states on 0,62 litres.
The maximum altitude in all three types of 37 km.
In the years in 1965 to 1968 Luftfahrtinstitut the Meteor-2 rocket, developed the first Flugtests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was capable of a Nutzlast 10 kg in a level of around 60 km.
Since then, the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 built.
It is also worth of Poland joined the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, two years later, the creation of a national committee COSPAR followed.
Poland participated in the programme also Interkosmos in space research with soviet satellites, and in 1978, the polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek Interkosmonaut second.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
In the last week, the Constitutional Court of the law on charitable work.
This decision has called on the public to a lively discussion.
It is interesting that the issue from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world, was based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free movement of capital, complete with rampant speculation go hand-in-hand.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (salaries) are Preisspannungen.
This term is a condition to understand, in which the manufacturers tried to import cheap goods by economic competition, by the competition of “undercutting”, in order to create more of a market share grab and its profit margin.
The large-scale means that for most companies, their production abroad to relocate or buy cheaply, or their business, the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
As the private sector no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for that it caused unemployment to increase the spending.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, and they caused by the wider economic and social damage to replace.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics here are superfluous.
The reckless practices of the private sector creates a situation in the individual economies, where governments are forced to compete with each other to make the social standards of its own population to artificially lower and thus to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private sector.
This manifests itself in particular changes in existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to its own people and to force the dictates of the private sector, in particular in terms of accepting.
This is done by financial constraints with long-term unemployment, on the other, by reducing workers' rights.
The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany there has, for a number of years, public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the wake of increasing the competitiveness of german economy, it regularly to cases in which employees received such a poor reward for the state to increase their income subsistence needs.
Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag employed workers discovered.
The austerity measures, virtually all the EU's southern states will, no doubt, in the same situation, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as in the 19th century was the case), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society and to hope that, at some point, private capital will flow into the country.
Here is, by its very nature, the question of where this capital is coming?
If it is from another EU country, only the poverty is moving from one country to another; or the capital remains the same from, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees working for a fraction of the salaries.
This applies across Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam, that the state is not with capital in its own economy involved, and that planning for economic calamity.
The private sector will narrow insists on its position that the state not to intervene directly in the economy.
But then we have to ask if the private sector the policy and therefore the whole state in their own selfish sense influenced or even draws.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and all-pervasive in all states lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of the corruption, the mutual benefit, the legislation, in the virtually everything, but nothing is criminally punishable.
In Germany, the reality is that a lack of finances private Staatsministerium crowded, with the industry Rechtsunternehmen interdependent with the drafting of legislative proposals.
These are then adopted draft legislation in the Bundestag.
The violence is not from the people, as western constitutions, but by large financial groups, which have their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies are quickly in a situation like the Appian in his work on the crisis at the time of the Roman Republic and Pompey Caesar” describes: “the state has long been the break-up, and the offices were filled with violence.
Against bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword.
The corruption has grown incontinent, and the people involved have already bought votes in the election…” “people with nature is not applied for posts, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul” … “we started really talk about the fact that the only medicine in this grave situation an autocracy is a strong man, and that should be chosen” … Appian thought it at Pompey, but the strong man was finally Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship.
As it turns out, is based in today's society as well as in ancient times on the reckless preference to its own advantage, without societal interests into account.
The private sector is by its very nature, is not in a position to the benefit of the whole of society to recognise and enforce.
The result, then as now, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites, not the slightest concern for deeper reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, we must, therefore, in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The current condition, can the demise of this regime in favour of liberal democracies, are regarded as some break in the next round is already taking shape.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have witnessed already today, as well as crimes against humanity, as we have from the older and newer history know, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on a not-for-profit work here is not a solution, or at least no lasting.
Under the pressure of the global and european economic competition in the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to make social level of population down.
This trend is therefore bound.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that the capital of the state of the economy, increase citizens' influence on the government and the private sector monopoly position in society in favor of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
“… Nothing from violence occurs, or ever could be,” sings the song Fragile Sting, the key verse, the refrain is: “… so that we do not forget how fragile we are.”
“When my sons wanted no wars, no,” says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the year 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, a host of reactions.
The one behind argue with Israel and its right to self-defence, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the state of Israel, the Palestinian Arabs committed genocide and describe the state of Israel as a terrorist.
At this point I would not write about who in these endless waves of killing anyone who is guilty and victims; in the end, today's residents of Israel, including the Selbstverwaltungsgebiete born in the current political situation and the beginning of the violence have not even seen.
My concern is that the readers to look behind the scenes to open the mind, of whom 95 years tension (from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) spots in the small country in the Middle East, in particular, are fit.
My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts, others are derived from this and go from my own understanding of it, who or what group of people, the events of modern history strongly affected.
The history of humanity is, first and foremost, a history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether there really are these people themselves were the autonomous certain steps, or whether someone was behind their throne, their actions to a goal vorbestimmtes relented.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is less concentrated in the hands of individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power within the life span of a generation.
Under these astronomical stabs a particularly rich families, as the head of the octopus called (I do not know if someone is still on them, I add this) - but not from the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first news agency (Reuters) was from the Rothschilds in the 1990s of the 19th century, bought the link of your name with hochkriminellen deeds, whose background is in the consolidation of its power, the increase in their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are nearly all the central banks in the world, and to the countries in which they do not attend the central banks are involved, they lead wars or fitted to these (before the attack on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, following the fall of Ghaddafis remained just four, with Russia its Central Bank, in the meantime, the russian government has implied).
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank to renew started during the civil war of their own (read: state) notes and 1865, was murdered in a theatre.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue their own notes and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve, he was assassinated in 1963; members of the Louis McDonald Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after the Federal Reserve for triggering the Great Depression wanted to sue.
The global appetite of the Rothschilds resulted in the years 1859-1871 to formulating a plan to unleashing of three wars by Albert Pik, freemasons and the 33rd highest degree of insight.
The first war aim was the big royalist Staatenwesen Europe to remove the second war in particular should be broken Britain's colonial rule, and the third war, the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would be for their comforts and luxury and would also not consume so many resources), create a Universalreligion (the ecumenism here is nothing more than the run-up), and finally to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top is working that triggers a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (or from chao-order from chaos).
But these solutions are wrong and always lead to deterioration of the situation (see the creation of the Federal Reserve, to crises like the one of them in 1907 triggered not repeat).
Having them by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo had managed the first World War, they destroyed the russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the tsarist Russia, the war was no longer necessary), then came the dissolution of the central european superpower, Austria-Hungary.
World War II easier to ignite, the bankers by the policies of a latent conflict by Germany with gigantic documented war reparations; they created by the condition of impoverished masses, so that the Germans only a sufficiently strong leaders had to keep palming, named the guilty and simple solutions offered; another factor has been the creation of a multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong german minority, the function of a fifth column should take and also took the Kriegsbrand.
At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, which is a branch of the creation of a Judenstaates wanted to see as much as possible to the historic area Judäas with Jerusalem as the capital of (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration created the condition for the mass immigration of jews to Palestine; there has been first clashes with the local Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler of the chain broke on the international bankers initially believed, or whether everything was going according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, created the suffering of the european jews in concentration camps, the condition for the recognition of the jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, as well as by the war reparations Germany against the soil for the Second World War, with the declaration of the state of Israel, the creation of the Brennpunktes for the Third World War.
If the international bankers, will succeed in this war is to unleash the jewish people as in the Second World War to the victims in the front Kampflinie, this time with the arab or muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (think only of how strongly people in Israel's supporters and opponents divide).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the conflict between Palestinians and Israeliten, where it is wrong in a never-ending cycle of violence, but at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
It should be between the peoples of Israel and its leaders differ, but the international bankers in Israel, just as we, the people, only its own candidate for the election.
The current Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, the hawk, is a typical example of a faschismusanfälligen, international bankers loyal dutiful politician is doing everything to ensure that a war with Iran, which in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan …), quickly becoming a global conflict could extend, and it is because of the control of Iran's only 2 miles wide on the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world's oil supplies pass, to destroy the world economy.
In which light because the words of David Rockefellers in 1994: “the only thing we need is an all-wide crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In its presentation of the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of Finanzaristokraten serves.
A world in which every newborn in the birth of a chip implanted this nature of total control.
“And it makes that the small and large, the rich and the poor, the open air and the servants of all is a Malzeichen give to their right hand, or in their face, that no one can buy or sell, because he had the Malzeichen: the name of the animal, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, anyone who has the intelligence, considering the number of the animal.
Because it is a human figure, and his number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig.”
The film Argo: if it's the worst that Hollywood call
In November 1979 occupied a mob of islamist students who demonstrated the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they were asking for the extradition of ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had fled the absence on his regime intact.
For the american government there was no good way out of this situation-they could not afford, the Shah to cast aside, as this is the confidence of their allies in other countries have been heavily damaged.
At the same time, she was not in a position, in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime led to the release of the hostages.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent disaster at the violent attempt to retrieve made it even worse.
The diplomats were finally captured after 444 days released after negotiations mediated by the algerian government.
The fate of the hostages called home a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the presidential election against Ronald Reagan in 1980.
The film Argo, directed by Ben Affleck and actor describes an episode in the history of the United States, a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the message has six Botschaftsmitarbeitern flight.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the canadian ambassador.
The CIA managed in cooperation with the canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; helping them a flamboyant Verdeckung story to its true identity-they travelled with canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, supposedly in the country Drehorte for a science-fiction movie.
The combination of genres
The experts on “Exfiltration”, Tony Mendez, developed the plan also made Hollywood's cooperation is needed.
The cover was credible, article on this film in journals, press conferences have been held and the fictitious Produktionsgesellschaft had a real office.
The details of the operation were long kept secret; the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a particular combination of several Filmgenres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic Politthriller, but at the same time, a so-called “Caper Movie,” i. e., the story of a successful Husarenstücks as, for example, the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the film the Stimmungsebenen-on the one hand the Dokumentarszenen (from Tehran in the Titelsequenz ikonische contemporary photographs to be shown, and also in the same Filmfassung situations, there are no major differences).
On the other side of the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and therefore easily taken to its extreme.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA and other key institutions-men in suits on Besprechungstisch, Amtsfluren, on the phone …
Ben Affleck with this remarkable film is a relaunch of his career.
From a belächelten actor is a director of respectable, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his third movie after the whodunit not easy Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller of the city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film Afflecks, not in their local Boston plays the film-maker.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics of the previous films by the director of the standard Hollywood.
Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada “played”.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place-the Eingangssequenz the storming of the embassy is in its simplicity and gives it very impressive, yet the feeling of Verwirrtheit and the unpredictability, if that happens, their history.
A similar effect, Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong Filmstab at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to face up to the fact that history is not, in fact, many in the cinematographic sense exciting scenes.
With the little but he works quite well, with the reality he sometimes nachhilft-then what is not always so elegantly works (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone call in America is avoided, or the chase on the runway, something curious).
The weakness of Argo is its all too broad distribution, which is caused by the need to act, too much in too many places to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, in their roles as Hollywood staff is very charming, their characters but would have more space, and in the film, they are far from alone.
Afflecks film by losing traction. it is a movie, the one with some interest, and the design and the to a thriller from the 70 years-like style goutieren angle.
Enthusiasm, however, it is difficult.
As a reminder of a date in some way of living history, and as evidence of how excessive but the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, however, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons of banana, and for the circus
The site www. bankovnipoplatky. com, an annual survey of the most preposterous charges, has declared this year decided that the competition “most absurd regulation or idea from the EU's workshop”.
“On this idea has brought us the recently put forward by the EU plan, a 40% quota of female representation in the management of large european companies to introduce,” said Patrik Nacher, who was responsible for the organisation of this survey, with the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated aberrations we see, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on unifying the Versicherungstarife for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance for insurance companies, because they are objectively less of a risk.
“Other incredible incursions from the EU's workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013,” said Nacher with.
On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory blend of bio-ethanol fuels in its wake naturschädigend is that of the ban on the reliable mercury thermometers, simply because this is a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes contain, or even the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen this year, because of the eggs were much more expensive.
Erntete criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term “butter” or even a ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 centimeters
The EU machine decides often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels during the rule of one or more member states are represented (as the Czech Republic is trying, for example, currently with veto threat by the demands of czech banks impose).
Lobbying interests were also discovered that the highest Handelsklasse bananas in the EU at least 14 centimeters long and must be “no Krümmungsanomalie”.
The European Commission argued that with the argument that they are only the mixed harmonisiere national standards, which would impede trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables from the EU against the resistance of some countries already weakened by pointing out that the previous directives to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, in accordance with the balloons in the sale must be equipped with the suggestion that children under eight years Luftballon without the supervision of an adult aufblasen.
The EU, citing an american study, according to the leading cause of balloons in the suffocation of children.
A similar reduction already applies to children up to 14 years for the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also funny ideas at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive, which european officials themselves-so everyone in the EU's official social function, because of the sensitivity of the matter for Greece will not use the name of Macedonia and instead must FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky. com nominee in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, in addition to the aforementioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a member state.
The EU, so that the Höchstvolumen in food stocks, which is on the day of our membership of the EU in the area of the Czech Republic are allowed.
The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the set Pilzkonserven volume for us, and a large fine threatened.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for them, that they have no sea, or from the idea of grants for applications for grant money.
These ideas, however, came not from Brussels, but in Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by this, that we have no sea.
We are in the EU to apply for reimbursement,” declared in the autumn of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument he gave was that the grain harvest was very high and the government camp following the so-called Interventionseinkäufe were overcrowded.
As a further way to seaports in the Czech Republic, the EU should Palas according to hundreds of millions of euros of us pay.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, after all, so far in that it is an invitation to tender for the purchase of grain from organised countries who do not have access to the sea.
Grants for requests for funding for the communities of the Department of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US DEU), specifically, if it is the means for the establishment of Fördergeldanträgen to Brussels.
Eu: bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations in the Member States are easy targets of criticism that the EU's efforts to regulate and, hence, effectiveness and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more recognition.
A deeper problem, according to these experts are more the EU grants for projects, which have absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of european integration have in common, but when the budget negotiations were forced by individual member states.
Emotions here, also calls on the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member states in Brussels for the right to use specific names of traditional products have to fight this battle and not always wins.
Although the Czech Republic after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the name “Olomoucké tvarůžky” to defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský Rum), whose tradition with us until the 19th century, had our manufacturers, however, in “Tuzemák rename.”
The name of rum should only be used for products from Zuckerrohrdestillat, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered in the EU products appear in the society of the world-famous cheese, feta and gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or Parmaschinkens Zwieback Karlsbad, now the carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer hops.
With an EU-brand with the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or Hořicer brags about the roles.
“People want me to do the Republic himself, but I am just an amateur,” Okamura said.
Mr Senator, as it comes to the idea for the President to stand?
It is not my intention, senator or president.
If, in our country, all without problems would work, I would get nowhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic for 20 years, as thieves plundered will walk free, while the people's taxes and the retirement age be increased.
I had no ambitions to politicians.
But if I see something that I do not like it, I try to propose a solution to change this.
And since I was about 40, and that independent and parteilos, I have no other option than to influence things, for senator or the president to stand.
In the Senate, have you been able to and then straight on the road to the castle.
You do your constituents the back?
I have said all the time that I fight for the castle after the result of the elections will be.
Later, I have this clarified and said that I was a candidate for the office of President of will, if I am elected a senator.
My goal is not the function of the role is an instrument with which I can do my vision.
To that end I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
But the problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and the television grumble, but anyone who raises, wants to change.
Come to the media, the honour of abducting a wish, and the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie.
About me, for example, it was claimed that journalists bribed or that I would I advisor Jiří Paroubek.
We are talking about your vision.
The battle over the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of political leaders as well as retrospective Vermögenserklärungen over 20 million kronor.
You have to change laws.
As President, you have in this respect not only skills, and the Senate as a whole will bring legislative proposals.
How do you solve this problem?
As a simple citizen I have worked to ensure that the business remains a free tour guide, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded policy-if someone from the right or the left is a good proposal, this deliberately refused, and the population is on.
As an independent Parteiloser I have a much greater potential to support from all political parties represented in parliament to win.
My advantage is that I and without Schubladendenken Parteidogmen from every party that can take what is best for our country.
See you as a person in politics rather than on the left or the right?
From the czech point of view, it seems to me that people can see more of the left.
For me, this left-right thinking but totally unimportant.
What is important to me is that we can make progress.
I do not care whether or not someone to the left or to the right; I want people associate.
I always support publicly any good solution, even if these KSČM or from the ODS is too, and I am against bad ideas.
It does not like you, if someone they described as a populist.
But you will not confirm what you just said?
If you are in a company set up a business plan, then you will have a Idealziel and a vision.
And this, you wish to approach.
This can be as far as populism, but all proposals, which I have spoken to function in the world already, or they have been key experts discussed.
But without support in Parliament, you just slogans.
And so that you come in the politics in the long run is not far.
Or do you believe that you, if you only long enough to talk to the people who will be able to, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and the public and to try to convince them on our side, to secure these goals.
As President would be not a problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live television to call on the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors to the statute book.
And the Angesprochenen would then have to say why they may reject it.
A strong personality, to the abuses, can put pressure on the political scene.
If you take only once the direct election of the president, which is a credit to the public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to allies for my views and vision.
With the policy I have only just started and I try my programme, for the support of the majority.
I always try to go to judge; and if it does not work, then I am in six years in the private sector.
That sounds a little, as if the Czech Republic should save Okamura.
I am not a savior.
I know that I can do nothing alone; I have with several well-known figures discussed whether it does not want to run for the Senate.
I have, for example, with Radim Jančura spoke, however, as a result of excessive workloads rejected.
In addition, I have the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová supported the fraud in the sale of light fuel oil discovered.
My candidacy, I began with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.
Sixty per cent of voters are not at all to the elections, and those who have gone to have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we have only two independents.
People have such a Senatszusammensetzung elected that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and Bezirkshauptmänner.
You think about setting up a separate party after?
I have not even thought about that, because I do not have much time, the past every potential Parteimitglieds to review, and that it does not have the money for it.
I have not even money for the transparent Präsidentenkampagne; on my account, only 20,000 czk.
You have no money?
You talk about Vermögenserklärungen, what would your?
I value my personal wealth of around 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, a home for about 10 million, another 8 million, an art collection, which is worth around 10 million, as well as an Ashton Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about one million, and I also have a couple of million in the bank.
The Ashton Martin was, in fact, a Kindertraum-James Bond has always appealed to me in the car drove galant to women, and at the same time against the evil battle.
They drive a Ashton Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money, you do not want to invest in it.
This is not very convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make about debt?
I have 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my programme is probably not too much attention.
And I am not committed to the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign is, basically, my salary as a senator.
But the Senatorengehalt alone, I could not live; I could, for example, my son, not the english school funding, the cost of 30,000 per month.
If I wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing at all.
Will you stay so further work as entrepreneurs, if your livelihood?
You said that you did not cut back on these activities?
But that is not linked to the level of salary.
As promised, I have my activities partially reduced.
For example, my deputy in the spring, CEO of the travel agents.
People want to see me as the good samaritans of the Republic saves.
But I must have something to live.
In the monthly income you were used as an entrepreneur?
Around 200,000 to 400,000, and it continues to be so.
As President, I believe, to stop operations.
The full interview can be found in the Samstagsausgabe of Právo.
The MVRDV architects to show that the real adventure is not only in the head-on example from Spijkenisse, and the newly-created Bücherberg 2 photos
“I think the building fun, it looks futuristisch from, and at last there is something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig Passantin, a roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, it technicians in a nearby corporate sector, says: “but it is nice to have the house.”
But I wonder, what we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is yet in one of these Old-Style-libraries, or?
Spijkenisse, a little besichtigungsbedürftige Schlafstadt at the gates of Rotterdam, the record holder is outlandish.
The 80,000 residents, community education rates, the lowest of the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid thing, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to education and the seven fictional bridges on the refusing, as nicely bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen depicted.
The success of the training was limited.
And so the Stadtväter realized that there was only one possibility, Mr statistics: a library, ago.
Winy Maas from Rotterdam Architekturbüro MVRDV, master of tollkühnen Balkendiagramme and producer of witzigen cynical, and often works, took up the cause with his usual equanimity and appeared for the hearing on competition in 2003 with five books, the rich and a grin on your face.
And while the jury still intrigued to eyes and wave our hands zuckte stapelte impudent Maas, of his distinguished Mitbringsel in size to a pyramid and ended aktionistisch underpinned his speech with the words: “love Stadtgemeinde!”
It is, therefore, my proposal for the Bücherberg from Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million expensive aufgeschüttet Berg.
It is part of a Revitalisierungsprojekts to the underground car park, supermarket, post office, and a couple of adjacent residential and Reihenhäuser with a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg with the second best price “Library of NL 2012”.
In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 nominated.
So that is the faceless Kleinstadtretorte, which until now have not had to offer more than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly behind City Hall, whose white walls, would be inclined to suspect a Molkereifabrik, for a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to books
The first impression: Büchereldorado under glass.
There is admittedly a lift, in the middle of the massif leads, but the real area-and tap the Lesefreuden fußläufigen climbing the topography.
The totally verglaste Innenraum is bright and clear, the shy Klinkerboden and the elegant Straßenlaternen unambiguously speak the language of a public Stadtplatzes.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
People are already looking for Parkbank, dog and played football and boys Mädels.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
“Usually the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle is a large, shady areas, which mostly uncongenial and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have the classic Raumkonfiguration upside down and inside out of the Lesebereich enclosing.
The interior of the Bücherbergs is shrewdly: in the middle, library, offices, Internet, and Haustechnikzentrale Schachclub environment centre.
A particular pleasure is the black bookshelves, which, sometimes, sometimes Wandverkleidung Brüstung Stiegengeländer.
Haptik optics, and smell are alien.
Even die-hard architects and whether the unknown Baustoffs Engineers shake their heads.
“We wanted to be here with recycling materials work,” said Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Stadtgemeinde Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen holding one day for a fitting waste product from agriculture.
For many years we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeterdünnes Kunststoffvlies than Wurzelunterlage.
This is cheap and zeiteffizient.
The textile holds a slender, two Saisonen, then it is ready for the Sperrmüll.
For the library, the fleece-for the first time in these amounts to four-inch thick plates are squeezed.
Under pressure and Hitzeeinwirkung discolour the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogenous, belastungsfähigen material that a bissl after new cars and a bissl after Sportschuh smell.
After 105 stages is at the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres will migrate in Literaturcafé with not only a fantastic prospect in the city, but also with dutch Kroketten eingetopften Ficusbäumen and rewarded.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right Luftfeuchtigkeit in Literaturgebirge.
Donations for the new soul
“You would not believe it, but this is in spite of the many Glasflächen a flagship project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the Bücherberg under a Glassturz is, it seems, the sun even on sunny days only briefly interior.
The broad Holzleimbinder, across to outside glass of face, serve as such as shadowing and catch a large part of the sun.
The Raumklima is very pleasant.
Do the rest fully automated Rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, has dared to go the way of the new library.
Also, Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde, Boekenberg even as a long-overdue Spijkenisses “soul”.
The reason: the opening of a few weeks ago, everyone residents invited to a book from his personal stock to donate.
That is for another day the optical gaps in the still not fully-stocked library-currently 70,000 piece-are filled.
The concept is good enough.
The shelves are filled up their back teeth.
“Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think, thanks to our invitation, each now residents of a certain relationship with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
If only to grace.
It is those MVRDV Königsdisziplin managed, in the jargon identity.
Spijkenisse Literaturgeschichte has written.
As young and uneducated, they may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: “Germans have greater role”
Germany has in the vote on the admission of Palestine to abstain from the vote.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on us-european relations, so that Berlin is balanced on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it against the request for observer status for Palestinians at the United Nations would vote in favour.
But then abstained from Berlin.
Why is that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not.
Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, but be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it is not of the american position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without having to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to a no-fly zone.
This was, after all, the NATO force.
It is difficult to Germany on important international issues a clear position on this issue?
Yes, it's true.
This is because it is his foreign policy and shifting away from a policy, as it were, from the US gemanaged was, to a german foreign policy.
This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are so between the fronts.
We expect them to play an independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I think they abuse are still on their role, but they are on the path to a more “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as France or Britain.
What is a “normal” foreign policy, what specifically from a german point of view?
It shows the willingness to national interests to take positions that are independent from those of the US or european partners.
I believe that the german foreign policy from the economic policy is motivated, so exports and its relationship to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and why Germany must protect its interests.
They have economic interests influence on the position of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN?
Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
That is why it must be careful to the public, but also the elite in the arab countries not to offend the.
This is definitely a role.
But I would also not want too much weight, this is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But it is definitely an important role in german thinking.
Germany has damaged its relations with the US, taking on major decisions abstained from the vote, for example, in the vote on Palestine?
I think, in Europe and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the german position.
Therefore, I do not believe that this is such a dramatic break was, as in the libyan issue.
Maybe Germany so that even a certain respect einspielen.
But because it signals that it as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests should be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions to the palestinian initiative.
The United States have been clear for a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the US and many european nations?
Because of the american domestic politics these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly pretty much sympathy for the european position.
But because of the political situation here, the government can this position publicly, of course, are not represented.
I believe that the real differences are not so great, as they always seem to.
If you look at the relationship between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, this is not so, Obama, possibly by Netanyahu's policies.
It is difficult to Germany, his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side?
I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified european policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of a broader approach and instead must things from their own position.
That they do, just with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role in Europe, a european position.
This is, of course, not just for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans, it is clear that they are a more independent role to play.
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international players-Germany wants to play an active role at all?
Or is the lead Germany still difficult?
Germany is not yet accustomed, it still is unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is the country remains difficult, a greater role to play.
If, for example, we look at the euro crisis, as will each time Germany a greater role, various anti-german feelings freely.
It is not simply the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
So, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to a variety of neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in european policy, the EU steadily filling the vacuum at the moment but not who remains otherwise?
The Germans will simply need to play a greater role.

“Brand protection” in China: if China is suddenly an Armani and Puma
An Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is an Armani Polo?
Behind this lies a in China are officially registered name, but they are not about the Ursprungsunternehmen has to do.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection so long as the real Lord who brought us not suing.
And even then, it is not clear whether it was right.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners, to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer in the Chancellery Taylor Wessing on Schutzrechtsverletzungen specialises in the Far East.
Every week, a new case ends up on my desk.
The rich imitators have a couple of additional letters, so they must register their trademarks.
So will simply Lu-from Gucci Gucci, Prada, Prada-Kny register.
German companies are also in this way, legally copied around the sports goods manufacturers Puma.
Pattloch opens up a raft of registration with the Community Trade Mark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a chinese company's trademark Zegna DF Puma, a somewhat synthetic label, which is also the Modehaus Ermenegildo Zegna used.
The chinese world champion in copying and violating intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities, there are almost exclusively mehrstöckige department stores, which sell counterfeits.
Pattlochs cases but are different: on behalf of his client, it is the fact that chinese companies by the Patent Office as officially given the right to use the name, already elsewhere is protected.
The chinese call this “Bang,” a Mingpai Beifahrermarke.
The word is based on “Bang Dakuan.”
So are women, rich men angling.
The chinese authorities are aware of any blame
“It will be bad for business, we have to combat it,” urges Pattloch.
“The brand is being watered down, the Alleinstellung disappears, the damage is enormous.”
The financial losses and higher litigation costs of the industries affected are in the millions, especially in expensive Vorzeigeprodukten.
According to the Marktforschungsgesellschaft CLSA is China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year's third largest market for luxury goods, and the fastest growing.
But erased entries in the dubious Markenregister are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
Up to nine years, the proceedings drag on, with uncertain results.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court rejected complaints, because after a long objected to the name “reality”.
If the plaintiffs have bad luck, he must pay the Plagiator even money because its brand in China, says Pattloch injured.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases concern also graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany, that company, which recently took over the german Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister.
The Chinese must therefore until now an emblem of using the Mercedes-star resembles.
The Volvo, Geely buyers originally used a blue and white logo, BMW recalled; the dispute was resolved, Geely has had to change it.
The Lacoste Modehersteller lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile in the other direction to look.
The chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The Patent Office CTMO in Beijing, while that of 2010 due to lower personnel and Raumausstattung bottlenecks.
Last year was one of the “emergency situation in business returned to normal life.”
So is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals by 22%.
Almost 57 000 such cases have been completed, 75 per cent more than in the previous year.
Yet waiting in the office still 81.500 objections to settlement.
Address it costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China and for the tenth consecutive year, the list of Neuanmeldungen throughout the world, shares with the authority.
This also applies to the existence of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million.
2011 were 1.8 billion yuan in fees earned.
Simply, this means that any application in an average of 160 1280 yen or euro costs.
Address it costing many times, as the case of the german family firm Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years of fighting, the company against a chinese Plagiator.
It is true that the Germans that the illegal manufacture of imitation Kraftfahrzeugteile unearthed.
But secured the imitators continue to the chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg.
We even have failed in this, as in Germany, not family name could be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Patent Office CTMO rejected the objection to the Munich as well.
In the next two bodies, Freudenberg may be right, but the fighting Prozessgegner until further today.
You have to watch your step
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: “the process is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and stress.”
The internal costs could not quantify the Firmenarchiv have even a hundred years old files they need, in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain for a “high six-figure Eurobetrag”.
“This shows how much it is worth to us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East to Europe even threaten zurückzuschwappen.
That is, if there are imitators vulnerable brands.
It is a chinese manufacturers in Germany, the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This area of business the company anymore, yet he has the registration.
“You have to watch your step,” says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise german companies when dealing with China is to be careful.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners “everything that is worth protecting, also known in China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg Markendramas is governed by its last act, then we should do the other side pay royalties for its own name, said Wentzler.
Or we will be in the segment in question out of the market.
World Aids Day: Stampfen, sing, help
The chorus in Heidelberg probt Imbongi and Swaziland are happy about children orphaned by AIDS.
The story of a link to the far more than 8733 kilometres.
First the Stampfen: Cowboystiefel, Basketballschuhe Damenpumps Herrenslipper, and look at the Parkettboden set the pace, find him soon.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of singers schwellen slowly-old, Bass, tenor and Sopran-lobby betören and follow up.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost from its Stoffschuhen he with his elastic wild gestures brings together.
It is Monday night in Musikraum, of the Institute for medical psychology in Heidelberg probt Imbongi chorus of a new song.
Of the 50 Sängerinnen and singer arrived, between 23 and 69 years old, from the Humangenetikerin by the householder.
“Om'Obani” is not an easy piece, every Chorstimme has a different text and those still in a foreign language: ethnic Zulu, the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland.
To help themselves
Worldwide, there are around 34 million HIV-infected, estimates the Unaids, the United Nations Programme on Bekämfung of AIDS.
23.5 million people living in southern Africa.
In Swaziland live 245000 children orphaned by AIDS.
More than 40 per cent of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 children orphaned by AIDS in the village of Esitjeni has the club Voices for Africa godfathers in Germany.
70 of them visit a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can sponsor.
They guarantee the child's school fees, uniforms and a warm meals every day in the Gogo-Center.
Imbongi means to ethnic Zulu Geschichtenerzähler or Lobpreiser.
The Bantusprache can speak fluent in this area, but no one sings.
For nearly ten years, the chorus songs in this soft foreign language and brings them from time to go back to where they originally came from: in South Africa.
Since 8 733 miles as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni, the voting power of the german part depends.
Forty per cent have been infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple Lehm and Strohhütten, a large number of whom are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents more, because these HIV succumbed.
In Esitjeni shows in miniature, and Swaziland suffers: very high HIV infection rates, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision of infant foreskin, the risk of contagion has proven to cut by half the population of barely passed.
More than 40 per cent of people in Swaziland-bear the immunodeficiency virus with mid-30 to die is not uncommon.
In a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the chorus of the village, but above all saw the Imbongis many children on the streets, which not only is there a lack of parental responsibility, but simply to everything: food, clothing, education.
Leaving school without qualifications, in a poor country, certainly no chance.
Initially, it was still the commitment of private individuals, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and a warm meal a day.
But a year later founded the chorus of the club, “voices for Africa”, which has since almost professionally for the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni cares.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI, syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Frequent viral STI, HIV, Herpes, humane Pappilomaviren genitalis or hepatitis.
Filzläuse Krätze and belong to the parasite STI.
Who are the Hauptbetroffenengruppen?
Syphilis and Tripper come mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that at least four of five all in Germany reported syphilis cases through sexual contact between men.
In the heterosexual adults are chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden Candidose (fungus), Tripper and humane Pappilomaviren frequently occurring sexually-transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults over here is comparatively small, however: around 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among young people enter chlamydia infections far more frequent than in other communities.
According to european surveys cover three-quarters of all infections young people between 15 and 25 years.
Come over here and humane Pappilomaviren among young people frequently.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation.
The number of syphilis infections, according to the Robert Koch-Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011 more than doubled.
The number of new HIV infections is since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 700 cases.
This is around a tenth of less than in the previous year.
What symptoms point to Geschlechtskrankheit?
The infectious diseases can ulcers in Genitalbereich, complaints to the Urinieren, outflows, as well as Unterbauchschmerzen Bläschen Warzen or cause.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100% protection.
As part of the pathogen can sexually transmitted diseases by Schmierinfektionen and close physical contact.
So experts recommend particularly in changes frequently Sexpartnern regular examinations.
Early diagnosis can most curable STI and after-effects will be avoided.
By twinning, donations and, not least, the quite the chorus throughout Germany ersingt, up to a lot.
“In total, we have about 200 000 euros after Esitjeni sent,” says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village of self-managed Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and durchsetzungsstarke woman, the money from Germany.
It is also concerned about the orphans of good store, at one of the grandmothers, for example.
The Gogos and how the old women on ethnic Zulu cites are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans to be included, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms on time every day to the learning.
Anyone who has come into Schutzhaus to Khanyisile, a lone woman who is paid by the club as well as the two cooks every day for more than 200 hungry children cook.
In addition, “voices for Africa” a Nähschule launched two Hühnerhäuser built and together with the American Health Organisation PSI organised that many in the village have an HIV test.
This is not to be taken for granted, because obviously the disease across the country, it also is silent, they prefer dead.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Strange in a country where the king officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch, King Mswati III of sub-Saharan Africa, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
Among other things, it is also state-sanctioned due to this way of life that the HIV in recent decades has spread so quickly.
But also the many migrant workers, the virus around the country.
Free condoms there at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but are rarely used.
The culture is different-flesh to flesh.”
For cultural exchange to promote something travels the Imbongi-chorus every two to three years, together with the South Africa and singing songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and self-assurance that many black on black southern bit of the continent from the apartheid era.
A bus full of white, the songs in a black language sing-as much recognition not only of mood and pleasure, but it has also had some fierce border guards a few tears abgetrotzt.
The trip is leading after Esitjeni, where the singer visit their godchildren.
Even though the small village on maps, little place in the valley of the River Ezulweni-it is more than aware of.
“Going after Esitjeni, there is the light,” say the people there.
And if the 8733 miles as the crow flies in Heidelberg, returns to the stampfenden singers in the street in the Proberaum Bergheimer, then this will shine.
Messenger: NASA discovered the ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover is probably up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA, the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is the closest to the sun, there are some frozen water from three on Thursday as Fachmagazin published studies have shown.
The probe Messenger have proof that it permanently in the shadow of the region of the planet is the ice sheet.
This should at least 30 centimetres, and perhaps even up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or asteroids that may be on the Mercury embarked on.
No one got the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in context, said the chief scientist of the Messenger-tube, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings, however, could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life elsewhere in the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Erdenbürgern probes are small robots and telescopes, such as Phoenix, in the depths of outer space to explore.

Our insights into space: the main telescopes
The telescope should 1608 by Hans Lipperhey invented-even before Galileo Galilei it a year later to Sternenbeobachtung began.
Since then, the mirror of the optical telescopes ever greater, and the insight they provide deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 until 1975, was the Hale telescope-in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego Fernrohr, the biggest in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, US, the Large Binocular Telescope.
It looks into space on two mirror, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio recognise on the Kanareninsel La Palma is huge-alone the mirror to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented, in order to save money.
Nevertheless, he achieved a diameter of about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of good design: the telescope is in his Höhenwinkel ground-and in his limited mobility.
The hobby-Eberly-telescope in Texas is in Höhenwinkel fixated.
Its special: the high Lichtsammelkraft.
This is because, despite relatively low Spiegeldurchmesser-to the world's largest Spiegelteleskope differently.
With the help of a Radioteleskops in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) hear researchers space after außerirdischen signals.
The Radioteleskop has a diameter of 305 metres.
In “the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Computerbesitzer anyone can help by as much computing power as he is available.
Look at the observatory European Sternwarte (ESO) in the Andes Chilenischen.
Here, the Very Large Telescope-the very sturdy.
With his total of four mirrors the Fernrohr also the medium-sized Infrarotspektrum ausleuchten.
Also on the chilean ESO Observatory is the European Extremely Large Telescope planned.

Also on Mauna Kea, a new, huge-telescope with a mirror-average of 30 metres.
Here it is on an illustration to marvel.
The most important impressions from space but the Weltraumteleskop Hubble.
Since 24 April 1990 it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, looks after extrasolaren Weltraumteleskop Kepler planet-predominantly to be habitable.
On 2 February 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 Planetenkandidaten since Missionsbeginn were identified.
In the picture, the last on Kepler Startvorbereitungen Weltraumteleskop documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not until 2018 on board a Ariane5 rocket into space shot.
The Primärspiegel the Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is to light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists estimate that the South Pole the Mercury ice exists.
Nonetheless, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger much closer to the North Pole for the planet.
Radarmessungen have for decades suggest that the ice on Mercury.
By the 2004-launched Messenger probe-the first to the Mercury has circled around-the scientists have now certainty.
A daily drink butter and 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan reach many people, a biblical ripe old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A Spurensuche in the country in which 97-year-olds still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan reach many people, a biblical ripe old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A Spurensuche in the country in which 97-year-olds still comparatively young.
The journey through the mountains is Talysch wildromantisch.
The minibus rumpelt kurvenreiche on the street, past densely wooded hills, rivers and simple reißenden Bauernhäusern.
Everything is green and saftig, one could argue that it would have been, in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of the border with Azerbaijan, Iran is only a few miles away.
Here is living the caucasian ethnic group the Talyschen that not much is known, other than that they were perfect and speaks persian Aserisch and long lasting.
Terminus is Lerik.
The small city flaunts to wuchtig architecture out of soviet times, which is not in the picturesque landscape fit.
Tourists come here, hardly onerous to the Azerbaijani capital of Baku.
Of the 323 miles you need eight hours because the roads only einspurig.
The enormous wealth that the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is here in the province has still not arrived.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik the stuff to the tourist attraction.
“Baku in May with the Eurovision Song-festival famous, and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum for longevity, probably the only in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from documented older than 100 Fatulayeva. shows a black-and-white photograph.
Here is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years ago was fathered a child
But the museum is the controversial star shepherd Şirali Müslümov, of the 168 years old.
A birth certificate, however, there is not.
And given the oldest documented people, of the 122 years old, seems Müslümovs age but highly dubious.
“1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973,” explained Fatulayeva.
The man was three times married and have 23 children, ranging in age from 136 years, he is still a daughter conceived.
Has Şirali Müslümov so his age for a couple of decades for it?
But Rembrandt Altersforscher Scholz, the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, by the very elderly in Central Asia.
“Many people Auffallend hochaltrige also exists in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “also in Sardinia live lots of very old men.”
Because of a lack of documentation, however, no scientific evidence about age, especially as register lacked.
Every day becherweise geschmolzene butter
The fact is, though, that the people of the region around a remarkably often Lerik biblisches age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100 years.
So why live here in the south so many Hochbetagte?
The Azeri Farid Mugimzadeh tour guide explained that with the specific genes Talyschen.
Museumsdirektorin Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that the diet is.
But that it is the stuff of kalorienreiche Talyschen so healthy meat, bread and milk, in particular, love and many of which daily geschmolzene drink a glass of butter, seems from a nutritional point not just plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, the young people in Cengemiran?, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, live Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years it has been to this region still comparatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have offspring, 143, lives in a simple Holzhaus, typical of the whole of the Caucasus region.
It sits on the ground with a Butterfass they tirelessly and herrollt.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Two small children jumping around.
In the kitchen to prepare the tea, the guests in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu-glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in reih link, and under her headscarf hiding it for a long time, dunkelblonde Zöpfe, her son with pride about our reveals.
I have my hair is washed with milk, and I never kept their colours.
“I have never used shampoo,” says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She has always just ate what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not a single time in the supermarket to buy food.
They then told by her husband, who was in the army.
The worst of it was in the period following the Second World War.
But everything was better than the “beloved father” Heydar Aliyew took power.
The propaganda sounds strange coming from an old woman.
But the cult of the Vaterfigur the nation will be driven to the country as a dictator, has almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took the helm.
After all, there is no hardship in Azerbaijan elderly.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros) a month as a pension, receives Mirzayeva here, an amount that you can live well.
And perhaps even Mirzayevas long ergrauter son right: “the old enjoy respect in our culture.”
You live in the middle of the extended family, to be loved, and umsorgt are happy.
If that is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive
The word “human right” is not in the Constitution
The revolution is returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution with Sharia law as the basis is controversial.
The egyptian president not back with emotion.
We must make the transition.
“It is successful, and that is my responsibility, from the people and from God,” he said on state television.
His speech was to the whole nation, but especially at the Coptic Christians, Muslims and the liberal, enlightened Säkularen.
So far, for they are all hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear.
Fear of a theocracy in the Nile from the grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said Mohamed Morsi almost entschuldigend, the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily curtailed and expanded his powers, “in order to save the revolution.”
But what of the 61-year-old engineer, a Ph. D. from the American University in southern California, really want to save, as the Egyptians, the world does not understand.
The judiciary should be ousted?
Indeed, the 234 articles, the Islamist-dominated by the 100-member constituent assembly into a late-night, 15-hour Parforceritt pushed through, some worrying.
As in previous constitutions also says in the draft, the case law based on the “principles of islamic law”.
But what is “principles”?
This was and is subject to interpretation, and it is feared that the vague wording of the Islamists and the associated legal room for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
That, at least, a new article hinzugeführter close: in all the issues relating to the Sharia Al-Ashar University consulted, the main islamic institution the country with great clout in the whole of Sunni Islam.
It does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy's legislation, which oversees the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation
Also problematic: civil jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts were used during Mubarak's rule to the repression of opposition figures.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in Militärhaft.
The state should also, as it says in the draft, “the true nature of the egyptian family” to “protect and promote their morals and values.”
The law is so unclear terms that state institutions, with the help of this article even the contents of cinema and literature could control.
In plain English, this means nothing more than censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly says the equality of men and women.
For another, prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to offend or slander.
But what an insult is and how it is to be punished, remains unclear.
Also questionable is the wording of the “insulting people” was banned.
There is already a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a Leader?
Subject to interpretation, as much in the draft, which Morsi to sign before and after his words “very soon” the Egyptians to the referendum will be presented.
“The revolution is back”
The opposition is taking shape for weeks against the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on on Friday in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed that the Charter, before it can come into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Nasserist Hamadin Drittplatzierter Sabbahi, the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the draft constitution was “on the scrapheap of history.”
Kurznachrichtendienst via Twitter, he accused the supporters of Morsi a “coup against democracy”.
“If he declared the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him,” said the opposition persuade Yasser Said.
“We are not tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been arrested,” the egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would be invalid.
“The Koran is our constitution”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, the smaller crowd that, as a precaution, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a Massengebet on the other Nilufer before the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, attended and chanted “the people calling for the application of God's law.”
They invited by Morsi: “the country Säubere!” and protested: “the Koran is our constitution.”
A struggle for control of the iconic Tahrir Square, where everything started, would probably have led to civil.
The Morsi's supporters were clearly not at risk.

“The word “human rights is not even before”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced the constitutional process, which until February have gone and all the social forces involved.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood under Mubarak, when they were in prison or in court.
Because he does not share their beliefs, but because, for him, rights are indivisible.
For this, he was beaten, imprisoned.
“And now, the word rights, not even in the new constitution,” he complained, in conversation with the “world” on Sunday.

These measures are blatant violations of the democratic rules of the game and be Egypt into a new dictatorship.
“Instead of to strengthen civil society, the President of them de facto aside,” complained Saeda.
But a democracy without civil society organisations could not work.

Rakfisk from Norway: is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards-and not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country's appetite for local quite übelriechenden fish have to do?
There is a selection of cheese überreifer.
They are in the midst of a crowd platziere dirtier, more humid Sportkleidung.
And left it there for a week.
So we must be about the smell of nasenbetäubenden Rakfisk imagine, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, around three hours of Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes, and this persistent smell in the air, just won't go away.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which, depending on how you like stinkend its fish-by up to a year in water ferments.
If Norway in the darkness of the country and the weather is colder, Norwegians will flock to a celebration here in Fagernes, of this, well, really very bestechenden speciality.
“You eat it raw spült it and then, with a glass bottles anymore,” says Halvarsen Havard, who actually works in the local fire station, but as a so-called “Rakfisk General” also organized the festival.
People around us to eat small Fischwürfel and take on large quantities of alcohol.
“People like the Mansche bottles of more than the Rakfisk Havard,” says.
The alcoholic beverage can crowd out the stink.
I get some Häppchen.
If it avoids the Rakfisk in Nasennähe, he is not bad, such as sushi, a rather long coach journey.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer norwegian era, when there were no first and fish in the autumn in luftdichten Salzwasserfässern watered.
In the depths of winter, he was then taken out after a long fermentation and-no doubt aided by alcohol softer end-eaten.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians in search of work are being forced to leave their country and migrated mainly in the US.
Today, the population is growing rapidly, more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health service.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who not so long ago was much richer than Norway, arriving immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important-as a vital, if strictly riechender part of the norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive courts, which you can buy here.
But the fact is, indeed, expensive-a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs impressive 10 euros.
Norway does not often in the press, and most people seem not to care.
Here you still hate it, Anders Breivik to name those racist, right-wing extremists, which last year 77 men, women and children shot.
Instead, it refers only to the “incident on 22 July.”
Norwegians, find it difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country to such brutal murders is capable of.
The main responsibility for today's wealth is in Norway since the early 1970's, the growth of one of the biggest oil-and-Gasindustrien the world.
“But oil is not the only reason why we are doing well,” says Anna, our waiter, the round trays with mature Rakfisk distributed and with her long blonde hair and blue eyes the Nordic ideal stechend embodies.
We are a prudent-as they say-people.
Your English is just as most people here are impeccable.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not boasting.
Norway, with its oil wealth is very careful handling, a large part of the Branchenerträge will be for the benefit of future generations in a special fund invested.
As in the years leading up to the Great Depression, all the money is raised, they do not, Norway had his wallet firmly closed.
“As long as we go skiing in the winter and in the summer, are able to go, we are very happy,” says Anna.
“And of course Rakfisk eat,” she adds with unbeschwertem laughter.
I am standing in the snow and ask me for any other court-from Rakfisk I have enough.
So an elk burger is in any case something else. enjoy the meat juicy bit of me.
But on the evening of the Stinkefisch is back on the menu.
The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several Olympic venues to organise a Rakfisk-Dinner, in which guests for the best-or perhaps the most challenging Geruchssinne-fish can vote.
There is a live tv with a switch to fly there Showmaster by plates with Rakfisk surrounded.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
“What did you sum up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?”
“Here are our points Havard.”
To applause and laughs.
A man falls from his seat, perhaps overwhelmed by the bottles.
But it is perhaps the stringent haze of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto on his arrival, Will Grant analysis prepared by the BBC which he challenges and the mixed emotions of his people.
Currently, the movement in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, it is always a congested city, but on Monday, a ring of steel, built several key routes in the capital absperrt and on the roads is causing havoc.
The aim was not, however, commuters on their way to work to disrupt, but protesters to prevent the Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto the Präsidentenbinde received and the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon's Mexico has been economically well able to prove, but the country is in the grip of a drug war which, in the last six years already 60,000 lives.
“My government is strongly committed to the violence,” Pena Nieto said at the beginning of this week, in the Oval Office of the US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.
Before he was with the US President on an equal footing, Pena Nieto was governor than his Heimatstaats Mexico.
In this sprawling, densely populated part of the country, which surrounds the capital, the opinions are divided on the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo is remembered, for example, like to him.
Inhabitants of the Urlaubsorts write him the development of tourism and the building of the infrastructure.
Around the city, can be found on one of the highways, Pena Nieto has left the building and a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads that it once was.
With his name badges also depend on outside of a modern Sportzentrums an impressive and interactive museum on climate change.
“We expect it to real and lasting change,” as his friend and political ally Olvera Gabriel Hernandez, who as a congressman for the Party Pena Nietos, the PRI is working.
In particular, regarding the safety and economy, we hope to have an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations from the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a man very direct, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, but he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast to the paved roads of Valle del Bravo not be greater.
The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of vital urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and to combat violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a corner of fallow land near a large garbage dump, in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murders of women left behind.
During the administration of Governor Pena Nieto were in the state of Mexico, more than 1,000 women are murdered-a statistic that even the city of Ciudad Juarez than for their violence and the killing of innocent women is notorious.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the view that the problem of the murders of women during his time in office, at least not properly addressed.
But in the worst case, his government had their eyes closed.
In a Betonbau, typical of the rundown neighborhoods, fighting Irinea Buendia with tears, as she photographs of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna for whom she shows.
The official version of the events, according to Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
“When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if their bodies washed,” remembers Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the Leichenstarre had already used.
While their mother told her story, looks up from the wall a picture of Mariana on us down. it is in addition to a cross, a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, so the family has until now denied.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin, Nörglerin.
You want to just accept their verdict and mouths.
“But this is not possible when there are so many errors and omissions,” she says.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday the Präsidentenbinde receives, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of mexican families were in the last six years of violent crimes affected, and the new president has promised during his tenure, especially in order to take care of this problem.
“I hope that, as President, he is so as governor, as he was,” says the PRI congressmen Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But fear of the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza most.
The prosecution claims: Bradley Manning has not complained about abuse
The public prosecutor's office against Bradley Mannings accusations that he had been mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with the Mannings time Militärgefängnis in Quantico, Virginia
The defense is seeking a dismissal of the charge is due to harsh prison conditions in
The US Army Corporal is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents to have
The prosecutor on Friday trying to determine that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of confidential information of american history-several occasions failed to rise above the abuse he allegedly suffered in Militärhaft to complain.
In a cross-examination Mannings: during a hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fein, documents to weekly visits to the prison officers while Mannings neunmonatiger periods of detention in Quantico, Virginia, no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, following a request from the defence to reject the charges Manning is held by the harsh prison sentence has already been punished enough, Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in the prison.
The Geheimdienstanalyst of the US Army, which in June 2010 was arrested, accused of during his military service in Iraq, thousands of confidential documents stolen.
The material was then published on the internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has Manning as a source of information never confirmed.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein with Manning, the forms by the officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico, where he had overseen the Militärgefängnis from July 2010 until April 2011, increased detention eingesessen.
The officials asked Manning, and wrote his answers to questions.
Fein as of Friday on the forms, Manning was on the treatment by his guards as “excellent” and the treatment by the establishment as a whole as “very professional”.
The forms, Fein, gave no complaints of ill-treatment, although the officials on his treatment of Manning directly consulted had.
Manning replied that he had his concerns expressed orally and officials have discussed this with him and declared, to deal with them you are not recorded..
“They wrote (after meeting the concerns of “no problems”, and this is not necessarily that I absolutely nothing,” Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lindh, Manning was asked why he has not complained about his treatment, than he was in January 2011 with a committee that met him a few months earlier on a form mentioned ideation should investigate.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting, was to make his Beobachtungsstatus on “prevention of injury” by downgrading.
The military said that it made him this restrictive status-the one notch below the Selbstmordgefährdung-on his and the protection of others.
“I wanted to persuade people that I was doing well and the Beobachtungsstatus on the prevention of injury (…) to get rid of a higher quality of life, from my perspective, to achieve,” said Manning.
Manning said on Thursday to his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he nearly two months before he was detained in July 2010 in the prison of the Quantico base in Virginia has been deferred.
In Kuwait, he said he had considered suicide as a result of the heat again and was unconscious.
Not allowed to know what to do with him or in the outside world is, be burdensome.
“My world fell at Camp Arafjon, in this cage,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning did most of his days in a small cell-spent at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours and without society.
We have a mattress, a blanket, Flip-flops, clothing, and his glasses.
Manning said that he had tried to move to stay, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep, or just lie down.
Always have it with light sleep, from the outside in his cell encroached.
If it is night and guards have turned his face no longer see, we had him waking up, so that it turns back again.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the treatment Mannings.
In April 2011, the Militärgefängnis Manning in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning also to an accusation that he made in his statement on Thursday, as he collected a night naked in his cell in Quantico and sleep in a morning count naked before guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had during this count has never had the opportunity to get its blanket umhüllen.
At the hearing on Friday, Manning, he had ordered his watch from a closed, the ceiling, with which he would cover can, and should, he has not, however, that nobody had called for.
On Thursday, Manning said that in the previous night, he has been forced to sleep naked and he had previously tried to an official, to show that he is not a threat to himself.
Manning, the officials said, he would have the federal government of his underwear or its Flip-flops can use to harm himself, but did not do so.
That night, Manning said, were his underwear, Flip-flops and glasses from his cell had been removed.
His lawyers hope that the judge and his account at least Hafterlebnisse Haftmaß shall be reduced drastically, he should be at his trial before the military tribunal, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning is minor offences to plead guilty, while other charges, which are seen as too extreme to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, the prosecutor's office will be from a justification of the prison conditions are expected.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was held in accordance with the rules that apply to all of the highest security arrangements at Quantico verwahrten prisoners.
The charges against Manning include boosting the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national Verteidigungsinformationen and theft of public property or documents.
In all the charges he is found guilty, he faces a life sentence in prison.
Mexico-my american identity crisis.
Many people were due to the lack of opportunities, forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to the emigrants to accuse-they are calling them hard times into memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was in the passport arrived than bewilderment in me wide.
Signs pointed to two queues, one for “Mexicanos” (“Mexicans”), the other for “Extranjeros” (“foreigners”).
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure what to me to go.
I am in Zentralkalifornien grew up all my life and was “Mexicans”.
An ethnic-acronym, just as my friends in Boston “irish” or my friends in New York “Italians.”
Later, I opted for “Mexico-american.”
But this one was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather's, there was no need for acronyms or put.
I was just Americans.
I speak spanish well enough, at least, to me in this language at both ends to an interview to claim.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my american accent, I will also do not go ahead.
So I took my american passport, and found myself in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda were all those subjects you expected if the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the mexican economy, which it is one reason that Mexicans today with equally likely to remain in Mexico, instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to be with the United States and Canada side and a north american trading bloc modeled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed that Mexico's war against the drug cartels to continue, although he gave no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never wasting a single to the United States in 1848, in Mexico, the country's leadership under vorgehaltenem gun, forced them to more than half its territory to leave.
But for Mexicans in centuries and not in minutes, are memories of this event is not to be overlooked.
Therefore, once a US Treasury official also only mildest criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the mexican press and among the elite of the country-complaints about how the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children Montezumas sink on the war-path.
And yet, the greatest challenge in Mexico's truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Interested resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people, for which the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of mexican descent in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree of a person, perhaps a parent or Großelternteil-no chance in Mexico to shy and immigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this person was a profile-brown-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of the people, and our allegiance to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now have to live the american dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that the american dream is that we live-not the Mexican.
Our identity is blurred, sometimes, perhaps, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of Mexico's ruling class do not like.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a monument of a humiliating defeat and look at us, because we do not have enough Mexico.
Our spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, is a symbol of the failure of our existence.
If our families in Mexico had failed, they would not have gone.
And then we would not now see Seidenvorhang caught-behind with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child legally in the United States einwanderte, I am reminded that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans there are tensions because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are, and Mexican-Americans take them so badly.
While US citizen, has seen itself as a part of two countries.
But many mexican Americans, I know, have the feeling that neither one nor the other country to belong.
We love the mexican band los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we as Americans saw it.
And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I would learn during my trip, is there anything that this relationship is more complicated: some parts of the mexican leaders and their links to the diaspora Bildungsbürgertums would resume.
You want to mexican Americans as a provisional “ambassador” for Mexico, their interests in the United States.
We should have our american colleagues, telling them how great a visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership, their ties to Mexico to step up.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many wounded feelings.
And given the unjust distribution of income, rampant corruption and the Drogengewalt, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I am afraid there you need alone, cronies.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready, the United States for dealing with Mexico, a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some mexican Americans harbour a grudge for how their family members until not so long ago were treated.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are “mexican” than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could be a windfall for the cornerstone of peace
Is it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual recriminations, countless buildings into rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed-and for the first time, rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of the israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians in their historic conflict seem to be caught, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally end.
A war that neither will be won or lost
At first glance, optimism, given the current situation inappropriate.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, the week's fighting Hartgesottenen on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis have pushed back, even though his group itself has seen major losses.
Although several Hamas leaders were killed and the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip, in one of the desolatesten and densely packed bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel, yet managed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, the Hamas in the West Bank, which Fatah's rival, moderate Palästinensergruppe is controlled.
And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
So, as islamists in the arab world have grown in influence, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a regional power wiedererstarkende, once known as Israel's closest muslim ally has for Hamas party-as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an islamic crescent-from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren-style before the Stürzung Bashar Assad's regime could, to Jordan, where Hamas allies of the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi, far and away the most important arab einwohnerstärksten and land on the southern flank of Israel has greatly altered the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's secular despot, until his fall 2011 ruled for 30 years, had little time for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas and its leaders verschwägert Volksansichten more dependent.
In future diplomatic negotiations could prove to Hamas as a player, even from Israel and the United States are not excluded.
Israeli hardliners, however, suggest an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no longer dangerous.
Israel's “Iron Dome” missile defense system, has been able to prove and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel is sleep.
In diplomatic terms, the United States steadfast in its position, many european countries have Hamas for the latest escalation.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has largely ignored.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004, some 30 Israelis were killed, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers remained, not least thanks to the security wall in the West Bank, and thus in the body of an eventual palestinian state hineinverlaufen. protect the jewish settlements, which are illegal under international law for have been declared, but always be developed further.
Netanyahu is good because his Likud Party in the run-up to the election on 22 January, Avigdor Lieberman with a still kämpferischeren allied group.
Why this nanny hinterlistigen Palestinians and give them a state of their own devices?
If they are really controlling the West Bank, would it not just as their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip also fire missiles?
No, it is better to have them behind the wall at bay and to punish them if they dare to the heads.
Perhaps it will be the hardliners prevail, but the Arab Spring, they may be thwarted in that.
Even if the Islamists, now in Egypt and other countries are in power, have little left for Israel, they will look first to the difficulties in their own country.
The Israel's defense budget is larger than the four of its Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will be the new Arab governments to refurbish their economy is unlikely to help.
The pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama teamed up to bring about a ceasefire could be a promising sign-and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians will continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination, a powder keg, which no doubt one day in the Israeli-occupied territories will explode, just as this week with a bus in Tel Aviv, exploded.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
Missions for the bloody suppression of Hamas in the Gaza Strip will, over the years, increasing its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a nudge from outside
The right answer is that which the more prudent representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and will be represented by this newspaper: two states, in which Israel for security purposes areas is stepping down.
For the near future, the small-hope is that the cease-fire outsiders more influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must now get together with Turkey and Qatar the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and is better placed than ever before to Hamas to the idea of a jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and a shared Jerusalem, to convince.
Outside arab nations should also Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
That would be more for the creation of a palestinian state as done with the imminent request for UN observer status.
Obama must also play its part in Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he lost the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he is as a reluctant participation.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for single Zigarettenverpackungen enter into force
Ill health warnings and body parts to neutral green packs for all brands are equal
The world's first laws for single cigarettes and Tabakverpackungen in Australia are in force, Markenlogos and paints, replaced by neutral olivgrüne lid, moreover, with graphic images of bulls, which are sick body parts by cigarette smoke and sick infants and children.
Of the different health warnings and pictures, apart from next Saturday is the only difference between the packs in the brand name, the identical, in small letters, printed.
Making Australia the world's strictest rules for Tabakverpackungen.
The australian federal government wants to deter young people from smoking by the glamorous image of tobacco is removed.
This is the government of studies that have shown that people with 26 have not started to smoke, with 99% probability will also no longer be starting.
“We can already see in young children age that they understand the message that tobacco companies with their Markenbild trying to apply,” Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek. you cited studies, for example, have shown that children have the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest Raucherquoten in the world and the changes only slightly on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco companies fought hard against the laws.
It was said, with the laws, the black-market trade favours what to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes.
“The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of british American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and indonesian counterfeiters are far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws of their business have been encouraging.
Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis Silikondeckeln and to cover the unbearable packaging has grown enormously since the corporations, british American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago at the Supreme Court, with its challenge to the australian legislation failed.
Zico, up to 6,000 units to Großhandelsgeschäfte sold and waiting for new stocks.
For us this is a good deal.
According to the experts, is the hole in the popularity of social media in exactly the group to which the plan.
A number of australian laws has tobacco companies from the tv advertising is banned, it banned them from than Sportsponsoren act and most traders are forced to cigarettes in shops no longer interpretation. now is the advertising in the Internet age.
The australian government has online advertising by local businesses and has banned parties, however, have no impact on international sides.
“If tobacco is marketed and only a small area has its products to apply to the Internet is not around,” says Becky Freeman, researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman, an increase of Erfahrungsberichten to brands, noted the “ordinary people”.
The question must be asked: is this just a private person, so the great service of Marlboro cigarettes, that even includes a video-or has a marketing agency to do?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry rather than on marketing to focus, with the new laws.
She has even gone so far as to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay the new rules-to challenge those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair Handelseinschränkungen, although none of the countries greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries to consider similar Verpackungsgesetze.
Canada was in 2001 was the first country to photographic warnings required.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many australian smokers are defiantly.
The images do not affect me.
I simply ignoring them.
“It is simply a touch and locked the box away,” says Victor El Hage when buying a packet on a photograph with a Mundtumor printed.
To be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl.
James Tabakhandels Yu, operator of the “King of the Pack” in downtown Sydney, says that the single packaging, stacking shelves of its more difficult.
“I have an hour took a shipment of einzusortieren, now I need four,” says Yu.
“The government would have to completely ban cigarettes easy-we would have told us that's it, we're close,” adds he visibly angry.
In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving, I spent five hours in the airport, unexpectedly, as our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
I had enough time to me a few thoughts on boredom.
I do not want to lie.
Half a day at the airport on a flight to wait is quite nervtötend-even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course Tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more graduates and lead Kindesentwicklungsexperten boredom as something positive.
If it were up to them, it is for us, and our children-ok, sometimes to be bored.
So that the brain is forced into interesting thoughts to lose, whatever the creativity.
And because most of us these days almost permanently on the other screen or a rigid, brings the benefits of boredom, not more.
The boredom, so we should welcome with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back once again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, with increased leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of “Boredom: a Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011), sees it that way.
“In fact, the boredom has a very long history,” he says.
The Hauswände Pompejis signs a latin inscriptions on boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the problem is that boredom in many ways defined and discussed.
After a long, reading Forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea of a Fokusgruppe of around 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom than the experience, “a satisfactory job, but it does not want to be able to define.”
Boredom is different from apathy, therefore, that the person is not employed, but would like to be.
The apathy, on the other hand, there is no rush to do something.
The Schlüsselerfahrung boredom, he says, is to “disrupt Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with bad mood and feel that time passes slowly.”
Boredom can almost hear such as depression.
However, Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or in the world, while depressive people the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that us is dull, even if we only have problems, we have to focus on.
In its study, “the Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention” in German, for example: “the inert minds: the definition of boredom in the light of the attention in September in the journal “Perspectives on Psychological Science” appeared, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment, in which participants listening to a band, in which a person a Magazinartikel read.
Some groups have heard a loud television channel from neighbouring areas, which has nothing to do with the content had heard it on other low-volume, so it was almost invisible, while the third group was not hear these noises.
The people who are barely recognisable television echoes surveyed, more boring than the other two groups, to feel they have had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this, and wrote of their difficulties of boredom.
When you try to take on a difficult and arduous task to focus the attention of the disorder can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, if you have a dreary work - “like the search for faulty products on a Fabrikförderband, music can distract and help, not to feel bored.”
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people who physically can fight to remain alert.
“Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln should learn more and more information than those who keep the Stillsitzen be forced,” Professor Fenske.
All of us at some point my boring-delayed flight, a loudspeaker dröhnender, a particularly tedious film.
But some people are bored more easily than others.
These differences in order to measure, developed by researchers in the 1980's, a “scale of Langeweileanfälligkeit.”
At the bottom there are statements such as “many things that I have to do to repeat themselves and are monotonously” and “I have so many interests that I did not have enough time for everything.”
With the help of such scale, researchers found that boys more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida-particularly on the need for more and more diverse external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a fairly abgespannter bunch.
In 1991 led Reed Larson, a professor of human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents for seven or eight times a day with a Pager kontaktierte.
He found that 32% of adolescents in the school and the homework Erledigen were bored, while 23% said that seem to be, if they are not in school.
But only 3% of the parents surveyed, bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages of boredom, increase or decrease.
He was sure, however, that “the youth is regarded as a particularly boring,” mainly because children and teenagers do not have a big influence on their Alltagsablauf.
So, back to my Ursprungsfrage: boredom is healthy?
In the extreme, sometimes not, because it leads to extreme physical people to take risks and the gambling or drugs, in order to alleviate, studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. Vodanovich, this view is Professor of the subject for more than two decades.
“With the boredom to the brain of a saying that we should do something different,” Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what is best to do.
If one is dull and the energy used to Gitarre to play and cook will be happy.
But television can do in the short term to ensure that these Glücksgefühle verflüchtigen long term but again.
So, a child who his gelangweilten iPad is enough, it can distract from the boredom; it has not learned to run or to control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: “self-regulation spreads from one situation to the other.”
The child is learning not just to entertain but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
We should also not to be critical.
Instead, our goal should be to us outside of the permanent Aktivitäts Technologieberieselung and at ease.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“It sounds as if we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
He believes that people have in fact, look for a way to switch off and relax.
“In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert will find it hard to look at when the noise has fallen silent again.”
In Colorado, there is no clear guidance on the new Marihuanagesetz
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for an offence in court, which in this state will soon be legal: the possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a pipe with which he smoked it.
Orozco was that he and some friends on a Septembertag drive in Lamar near the Kansas border, when they were stopped.
After the police found marijuana in the car, Orozco had been in the possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien summoned-Kavaliersdelikte, each with a fine of $100 and have received a court hearing.
“We are being treated like criminals,” Orozco.
But is he?
In the uncertain weeks following the decision of the state, small amounts of marijuana for personal use, to legalise the answer depends in hundreds of smaller, less drug-related crimes by the law, as the site.
Hundreds of offences to be marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the approved similar measures, have already dropped.
The police authorities pursue adults over 21 years ago no longer for possession of small-scale, which is legally permitted once the new legislation in the coming weeks to enter into force.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that existing Marihuanadelikte quote and people are still on trial.
At the same time, in a number of cities, suburbs of the Denvers until the Western Mountains on new, state-licensed Marihuanageschäfte attended the opening of their communities.
“This situation is evolving so rapidly, that I do not know what will happen next,” says Daniel J. Oates, chief of the theater in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington, scratch their heads at a loss.
They are waiting for a road map for establishing a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug-and have been given a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, we are of the view that Colorado, in every case, most states is ahead of what the regulation of marijuana is where the drug only for medical purposes and then Eigenkonsum legalised.
“Colorado has a more regulated market. the state lends itself so well to guide,” says Brian D. Smith, the spokesman for the Insurance spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith is also on the ground or that no system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide to serve.
“We have no real precedent that we can follow,” he adds.
The Washington law, known as I-502, enters into force on 6 December and is thus also the conclusion of a grey area in which the government licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalised.
And unpleasant Praxisfragen must be clarified in this time around, such as the imposition of a state of “fair access” to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of Cannabisgeschäften within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare centres should be agreed.
“Nowhere is it more difficult to be a location for a lizenziertes Cannabisgeschäft to find than in urban areas, especially in the conurbation of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the “Center for Legal cannabis,” a recently formed research group.
On 21 November Chief Oates sent his staff theater in Aurora, an e-mail in which he said the prosecutor would be smaller Marihuanadelikte among people over 21 years, no longer, and that the police had “immediately” no prosecutions for such offences will strive for.
Chief Oates added that the police continue to urban standards to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers will continue to prevail.
In Weld County in northern Colorado represents Bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken Buck a harsher view.
After the vote, he admitted that his agency would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz, mainly to consumers for withdrawing.
Currently, 119 people for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana on trial, although many also for other offences have been indicted.
“Our agency has the duty to monitor violations, which are the Tatzeitpunkt crime was,” Buck said in a statement.
The reactions themselves are in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, is ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the Landkreises shows for the possession of small quantities of adults no longer.
Bezirksstaatsanwalt Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided to add, however, not all outstanding Besitzverfahren fall.
“I do not think that I waste my time in order to enforce the law until it is changed,” he says.
While 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the beginning that this would not be a simple matter, the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions throughout the state that encouraged local officials under a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment.
In Bezirksstaatsanwälten was an “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, for the defendants Marihuanadelikte in court and on the ground as a spokesman for the national organization to reform Marihuanagesetzen operates.
“You have such a large part of their lives, to prosecute people for the legalisation, that they still cannot accept,” he believes.
The first states that smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol will deal with Colorado and Washington as a national test-cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare a legal age sales, they also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level to continue to treat as a crime.
The Legalisierungsbewegung advocates hope that the Justice Ministry to give in.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers of medical Marihuanas has the federal government, the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states, for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former-drug policy advisor to the Obama Administration believes that Kriminalbeamte probably no doors are leading to smaller quantities of drugs seized, but is likely to resist that, under the new legislation, state-regulated legal marijuana shops.
Several cities in Colorado did not even wait for the federal authorities to act.
Before the election, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana business, although this is only open in about a year.
Last week decided Montrose, a town in the west, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week.
“We do not want to get into a position where we license and then somebody at the federal level have a huge problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
Our community has voted against the change in the law.
We have, for which the community has decided and did not ask for what the state has decided.
There are still many unanswered questions.
Petronella Wyatt from Oxford: I was bullied because I am a Tory
Not only university students today will be attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream, a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother who had gone to university, I once Wissenstempel for most of the world, for a modern greek symposium that the great pillars of civilisation-free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my Worscester College in the late 1980s-there I had intended to study history, again-I had my suitcase and so the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
Recently in the Evening Standard, I was told I would be gone, because I have a problem with it, had students in neighbouring rooms in sex.
The author of A N Wilson said schelmisch, I would leave the university because I was forced to drink from cups, damaged.
But the truth was less amusing.
I walked away.
Yes, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or from a private school because I was in.
I was bullied for one reason only-because of the alleged in this cradle of enlightenment so narrow and cruel seemed now: my late father Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I have been an advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, current, reportedly suffering from a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution.
The organised and increasing hatred of Tory students at Oxford, has now developed such dimensions, that a group of them last week, the same Gleichberechtigungsschutz requested, the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the junior common room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College say they will, because of their political views “often actively isolated, attacked personally and for undesirable,” said.
They call for a place in their Gleichberechtigungskomitee College, in order to ensure that their opinions are freely expressed.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent Abandoned documentation on political students on BBC Two, “Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right,” the Tories as eccentrics and neo-nazis.
It has been demonstrated, among other things, a graduate of Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association student in a Rolls-Royce and went with silberfarbenem silberbesetztem protzte suit and cane.
Conservative students at other universities say that they are “scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees”.
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the conservative student movement of the University of Nottingham, in a Sunday newspaper said: “there is a growing Linkstendenz in universities.
The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon club, without us even to know.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in Corpus Christi, which initiated the request for greater protection, is of the view that such a climate is “unpleasant”. the 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-elect of the conservative student association of Oxford says that it has in JCR-members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
“This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and the welfare of members”, she says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford, I was part of a minority.
As an incredibly tentative 18-year-olds, I was in September 1986.
The hatred of the conservative party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university in favour of Margaret Thatcher-a former student, because of cuts in higher education is no title of honour.
The atmosphere would have even stalinists squirm.
In the first days of the first week of the new students and the Tutoren to know, I got a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the Tutoren the mockery of Tory students not only tolerate, but also happily take part.
Political issues such as the Bergarbeiterstreik, privatisation and the rejection of the Government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa, found their way into the rooms of the holzgetäfelten Tutoriums.
When I first started these events should I french texts from the 18th century translated into English. on what it should be, I was not taken.
“Miss,” Wyatt said the tutor Harry Pitt died (now), “please translate the first paragraph”.
I came here.
Pitt was a small man with a face as from Kuchenteig, and quite unpleasant.
“Weigern is Thatcher, french supporters to learn, or are they simply stupid?” he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
Wallten tears in my eyes.
“I propose that in your leisure time, a few Französischstunden-so if you do too much with their social activities are employed,” Pitt knurrte me.
I returned with hängendem head in my room.
That evening, I sat at the College alone at dinner, when someone easy on the shoulder tippte.
It was a Englischstudent from the second year called James, who is a member of the conservative student association.
“I know who you are,” he said gently.
Unfortunately, it is the way it is.
Anyone suspected of Tory to be harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most of the incoming Tory claim, members of the Labour Party to be.
In a local pub later, I tried to block me.
I insisted that I cannot in all respects with Mrs. Thatcher's views.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
An incoming in philosophy, politics and economics, the irony is that as a conservative force in Eton College visited, said to me: “you are the daughter of a Faschistenschweins.”
You are dirty.
Other students who shared his views.
I was perverse and bad way.
“The tories have sex?” asked me one.
The beat each other, right?
I felt, as homosexuals from the more liberal legislation of the United States may have felt.
Would I ever get to Oxford University to lead a normal life?
I would like only after dark can make?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclination to suppress it?
The three years before me were spread before my intellectual eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, who is openly as Tory was was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which has its headquarters in my college.
He was not only for it to be hated, a conservative, but also because it Thatcher at foreign policy advice and wrote speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place it was small-minded and provincial, rejected him for his marxist-deterministische Geschichtsperspektive.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
“You will not be happy,” he told me.
I began, between Oxford and the house my parents commute and found refuge in more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated, Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed in disbelief.
During his time in the vierzigern all political views were accepted.
“But it is the best place in the world,” he said sheepishly.
Something they would never do that, not in my city of träumenden Turmspitzen.
Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners.
His wet eyes tarnished.
Give it a chance.
I am sure someone neckt you only.
It would break my heart if you gingst.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakening.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, the pressure to renounce his convictions.
During a Tutoriums during the following week, in which another Geschichtstutor seriously had claimed that I was “an enemy of the people”, I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly zerging in shame, I made that my parents had been subjected to “a brainwashing”, and called it “silly old.”
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, which is the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career beating.
At the time he wrote a week two columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid me in my room, and after five minutes gave my Häscher.
As they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Like you can call me a weinerlichen Schlappschwanz.
But no 18-year-olds should ever at a school in spite of such intimidation and have to suffer.
And it is even more tragic is that it was an Oxford University, which not only 14 Tory originated, but far behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought in hiding.
“Valentino is elegance of celebrity”
On the occasion of the exhibition “Valentino-Master of Couture,” which opens this week in London, speaks with ABC Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other clients of the famous italian Modemachers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the british capital, the accommodating an exhibition about Valentino Garavani is worthy.
This has the designer with the opening of “Valentino: Master of Couture”, a bright Retrospektive, for the more than 130 clothes the Haute Couture were being compiled by his “Maison” over the past 50 years have been created.
“I love that Palace,” he says, with his distinctive italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story, the sole protagonist in “Il” Signore Garavani, but without his distinguierte clientele would be written.
Valentino had always been stickige and fascination for the distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, which will continue until March 3 to see, there is a wide range of private letters and photos with the signature of the erlesensten aristocracy, ranging from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social advancement in the city by the modest Modemacher Voghera in northern Italy for the International Jetsets idol.
In love with the nobility, must not be at a disadvantage.
“At least they are not their overturned on your beautiful carpet, as some celebrities do fine from the pop music,” says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular and elegant, more generous hosts.
“We all saw us if we were invited to his house in Gstaad,” says the “Exfrau Heini” Thyssen, chummy with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always been the elegance of celebrity instead.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Also, the Argentine model Valeria Mazza forgets the charisma of the Modemachers not.
Many years ago we went into a Modeschau on Piazza di Spagna in Rome to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music and its influence is felt.
“All the guests feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, which her career in the week of the Haute Couture in Paris began in 1995.
“You never go out of fashion, because its design works of art,” she says finally..
Latest origin
The lives of Garavani is no history of Versessenheit of mutual love affairs.
He may people with good education and top titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was in a glorious and 60 meters long catwalk of transforming a role reversal: the user takes the place of the model and the catwalk, along with a “fantastic” audience to admire masterpieces of Valentino, as, for example, the dress, the Jackie Kennedy Onassis for their wedding with Aristóteles chose the Kostüme, Monica Vitti in “La Notte”, or a wool coat and leather, the Empress Farah Diba belonged.
In this audience from Modepuppen emit as the name of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria from mail-coaches and taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Abascal and Naty Modemacher, 2006
Many of these much-say that the first Valentino is like the first love, “unforgettable”.
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a record type “Gillette” and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection in 1971-1972.
“It was a present from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the Inter arma silent Musae the Designers.
“I prefer it to all others because of his great love for the women and because it highlights our beauty,” adds the former Duchess Feira added.
I like the colours that he used, very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and the fashion Meinungsführende Della Patricia Giovampaola d'Arenberg can remember the first time, when she was wearing a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of the age and to have the opportunity to one of its Abendkleider …
At the end of the 1990s, we had finally.
I bought me my first-Valentino dress for a festival in the castle I Vetters Edouard de Ligne, the Prince.
It was a red dress with a flying rock and drapierten Oberteil refrain with a name.
“It was a dream come true to hear about,” says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
“Valentino depends not on the fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explained this italian Aristokratin between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg preserved their Abendkleider the Modemachers “with scrupulous care”, because “a dress is not just a dress, but also the associated memories.”
The “king” of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the Hochzeitskleid by Marie-Chantal Miller for their marriage, with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 “Ragazze” (as the Modemacher his Näherinnen called) were necessary in order to this elfenbeinfarbene silk gown with 12 different beads, embroidery and a four-and-a - half metres long Schweif.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, was this dress is a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, “the return to the top of the serve society.”
For years, with the “savoir - être” of the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award Cavaliere del Lavoro, Italy), Commandeur de l'Ordre et des Lettres, the Arts awarded the Honour, Garavani added so many honors, as each of the husbands of his serve.
“I always be sophistication, his calmness, his appearance and perfect gepflegtes noticed,” d'Arenberg, too.
I have given it the last time a month ago at a gala dinner in the de-Orsay museum.
He was sitting at the top table of Gräfin Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
“He was a stellar; the time leaves no trace of him.”
And that says a princess …
The most difficult job in the world: the human pests from Kawah Ijen
For four of the euro, the winner of the indonesian volcano, their lives and their health at risk if they have 70 kilos of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 Minenarbeiter, their lives by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the indonesian island of Java.
He has every day, right down to the ground, where his Kraters rise from the earth ausströmende schwefelhaltige gas in contact with the air in tablets.
After great Schwefelsteine has fallen, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms, transported them into two Bambuskörben on his shoulders on the slope of stone paths.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which is up to a level of 2386 metres but the exhausted bodies need more than 40 minutes for the rise in Schildkrötentempo, while the balance and keep their steps must be careful to ensure that they do not slip and fall.
You know that every step of their lives can cost, as a french tourist happened years ago on the steep slopes of the Ijen Kawah plummeted.
The Minenarbeiter of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur, which reduce them.
Top arrived, they pave the path between the tourists, as Zirkusaffen taking photographs and run with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a Minengesellschaft a little further down a total of 1850 metres set
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and (never better) said its workers, which they 662 indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilo of sulphur pays.
It sold them for 10,000 rupees (83 per cent) to the petrochemical industry, because of this mineral in everyday life is widespread and the manufacture of matches, Feuerwerksartikeln happening, cosmetics, and even the bleaching of sugar is used.
“As we normally 70 kg, we receive for each way around 000 rupees (3.8 euros),” says us Anto, usually three routes on the day.
For every line it needs three hours that he is fully managed, at the end of the day, however, he then 120,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What a lousy pay for such an almost superhuman effort looks, however, is three times as much of what he would earn in the fields.
“The Tagelohn Minenarbeiter here, where the Kaffeeernte 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) on the day will be paid and the average monthly two million rupees ($167), is very high,” said the winner, who had previously as a builder on the tourist island of Bali was working.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family after Banyuwangi, a village near, returned, and for a reason that in Indonesia, as important as the sulphur is: “I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have them to Java brought them to convert to Islam.”
Anto has asthma, coughs, often breathing with difficulty and his eyes are because of the poisonous gases irritably.
The 27-year-old Anto sets for three years of his life at the Ijen Kawah on the line, the sulphur to him before the first traces, though he has his face with a mask and Spezialbrille covers.
Anto has asthma, coughs, often breathing with difficulty and his eyes are because of the poisonous gases from the volcano irritably.
This is the price for reaching his dream, he must pay.
“I will be here two more years of work because I opened a shop or would like to learn spanish or french,” he promises, in a more than decent English.
This pleasant and intelligent, but from life gestrafte young man could be a tourist guides, waiters or reception at a hotel, but instead work he carried out the work of one Tragesels.
He shares a dirty Holzhütte with other agencies and is every morning at two o'clock at night, because the sulphur ausströmt, where his distinctive yellow paint bläulich shine in the darkness.
The shadow of challenging, it is rising in the light of a small Stirnlampe on his helmet, which he himself from his own money has bought into the crater.
Approximately 400 vehicles, on the Kraterboden baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their huge profits, the Minengesellschaft the mechanised Schwefelabbau not in order to cut costs, and gives the providers that are working on their own account and will be paid for by weight, no equipment.
You also get no benefit from the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, the guardians of this national park, along with the entrance fee of $15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from the tourists, the photography of the volcano and human Tragesel.
“This work is for the animals and not for the people” protested Madrusin, a stämmiger, 42-year-old, winner of the three decades since leaving school at Ijen Kawah works.
He is capable of up to 110 kg and assurances that he continues, “as long as it is”, because it had the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even if the sulphur's throat burns and eye jucken, when the wind suddenly turned around and the Minenarbeiter in the thick pillars einklemmt from the crater to intercept the men are so tough that no one complains about serious diseases … except, of course, the usual Arthrose, breathing problems, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, the weight of the baskets are distorted.
With the basket on his back, with his flowing Unainik 53 years in the position, 50 kg.
Every day, he and his allies break 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, from three trucks on a Ziegenpfad between complain to the camp in Tamansari in 18 miles away.
“I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano all my life,” explains Unainik, when he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth missing.
Of his five children working the grandfather with his 30 years as a sulphur-bearers.
Time passes, but the mediocrity, generation to generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: those who as human Lastesel Ijen Kawah on work.
Singapore needs the economy to save babies
The Singapurer doing that they do not have children, the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and bringing up children.
“The population of Singapore has to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my wife, we are fulfilling our patriotic period and we create our lives!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons but, nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viralen video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a Rapper-song, the local sayings such as “pushing is a “bao (loaf”) in the foot, through the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, the video has spun preserves the hope that the advert on entertaining way, to draw attention to the problem.
Your creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wants to use the power of the music that people wanted to get a “national duty”.
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The Fortpflanzen, we are the worst in the world, which is why we have said that this is an issue that we have had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the sale of perfume with Pheromonen or the organisation of speed-dating evenings (quick flirtation).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily led to success.
So we thought: why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a rap to komponieren?
1.2 children
Who is this issue does not easily is the government of Singapore.
Every year they 1,300 US dollars for political measures to encourage more people to have children.
A package of government for married couples and parents grants of up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But it has had little success.
Singapore is a hi-tech, wealthy city-state in south-east Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is known.
According to its national Bevölkerungsbehörde, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the rate was about 2-what is known as Ersetzungsrate-was in 1976.
So why not get the Singapurer more children?
Wei Ming Tan, director for marriage and family policy of national Bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this is a “better education” and “greater career”.
“This has been possible for people, except to marry and have a family to provide more options in terms of life goals and to have to set priorities,” she said.
These changes in the social realities of the higher number of people living alone and the delay in the marriage and birth contributed to the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that has led to a surge in migration, the reduction of the population, resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites, where the little covert xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who criticised the low wages and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the governing party in Singapore last year, its worst election result since independence.
Since the election was an attempt, the problem with higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers to correct.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the known impact on the growth of one nation, tax revenues, the health care and immigration policy, shows the example of Singapore, unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small houses to be built.
It has already, impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has started, the number of small Appartements control as “Schuhschachteln” are known and in certain areas of the city build.
These have a Wohnfläche Appartements of 46 square metres and show a large Verkaufserfolg.
However, the concern is that they can promote the lifestyles of the people living alone, and that it deters large construction firms, to build housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the EL Immobilienfirma Developers, says that his “Schuhschachteln” much more quickly than larger housing units will sell.
They are so popular, and the units are for days and even weeks sold out faster than the larger housing units.
That lead them to our cash flow are a great deal better.
He is, however, that the new standards are the developers of clearer guidelines, which previously obstacles placed in the way they were, if too many small housing units in a project to build.
Too much stress
Singapore, a city-state.
Even if these new rules of the road to a rise in the national birth rate could be the talks with the Singapurern in the City to work indicates that it will not have a major impact.
“The people are very stressed, housing and education is expensive, which is why many will be delayed,” says a young managers.
The other children can get.
“It is important for me about my own money and time to have another one,” says about 20-year-old man.
Men and women in their career, the stress and the cost of the property and education as the reasons why they are not able to have children.
Therefore the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to have children, because the government can still do so much.
The offline private offline is privately online
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the capacity of private or “the area of private life, where you are entitled to protection against any kind of interference.”
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How will this definition to their everyday lives and the social networks?
They understand the risks to which it is exposed to situations on the Internet if he makes it known that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 years, often on the net.
In four of the cases linked to the concept of “something very personal” on a personal level and “the password and user” when they put him on the social networks would apply.
“My deepest secrets I would not in a post office,” says the 10-year-old Jorge, in the importance of “private” on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Windows Live Messenger and hotmail to explain where he spent two years on accounts.
“This is very confidential secrets, my mother would know it, but not the whole world,” he confirmed.
I invite belgian francs on beautiful images or pictures of games are high.
I expel me, and my time with friends.
“I would not share the photo, not by me, or from someone who makes the idiot,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to pornographic photos of Nackten, from crime to publish or abusive or violent comments to write.
Jorge assured, 35 friends to know that he has nine belgian francs and Folger on Twitter.
Most have relatives.
Including the mother of the password to one of the accounts.
I gave in to Twitter to express and interesting tweets to write.
“I do not know whether someone will respond, I invite them only high”, he added.
“The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly with relatives in the distance or with friends,” he states.
Asked he says that he will never accept an invitation from an unknown man.
Even if someone a stranger empfähle, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old José, is different.
The teenager has Benutzerkonten in hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. Ask is in it too, 20 of the people not to know that his Freundesliste added.
“It frightens me not because we have something in common, for example, music,” he states.
After the boys gave him no hints or made him after his address or telephone number.
“If someone pestered me or they demanded of me, I simply entferne him from my Benutzerkonto”, he said.
José spoke at Ask, after he had read a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy experiences are not unknown to you today as the Cyberbullying is known.
The friends of a friend was in a social network to ransom.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He has never know who it was,” he assures.
According to José, the victim the Benutzerkonto not closed.
“He has only done privately.”
He then outlined a series of steps to a safe Benutzerkonto konfigurieren.
Unlike Jorge would this young photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations hochladen.
Yes, I would do if he is unsympathetic or I can get one.
“But I know this Cyberbullying is,” he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with degrees in teaching and learning, says that children and young people to understand that it must be the purpose of the social networks is to inform.
“The Internet was created as a vehicle to search for information, with the appearance of these pages, but the rules of the game have changed,” she says.
Porras explained that the academics, Marc Prensky, holding a Masters title in teaching at Yale University and the author of “Digital Natives plant and Immigrants” these concepts in the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives, they are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants that they should have taught us, where we even learn how to do it,” he says.
He says that this is a complex subject, “because we demand that they have a defined criteria, which spread to be published or should be mentioned, and this in an age where the maturity is not enough.”
“You should pick if it is the most important thing, to be loved, thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,” he added.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people of what privacy is to ask them questions, they think.
“You have to tell them that they should not do, is not working,” he says.
Porras called then some possibilities: there are things you a stranger who would not tell us why do it then you on the Internet?
Or: would you like it if you have a photo of you published, such as the one that you have published a friend?
Do you know what the other about you?
You are the other person's permission before asking if you have photographs of celebration labelled?
And another question: what you need to know, at any moment doing?
Another is that they understand that they must act online as they do offline.
It is the same rules.
“Someone outside of the Internet, with respect, decency and other principles, and the same must apply for social networks,” he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that the parents of the directives of the social networks carefully.
If they understand all the parts, they have solid foundations, with their children about the importance of Eröffnens Benutzerkontos one on the Internet to talk.
“Beispielsweise age, or what you share or publish,” he says.
According to the Guardia the children need to learn the lesson of “thou shalt not to talk to strangers.”
Conclusion of the summit of the Unasur without publishing the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Summit of the President of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publishing the Lima Declaration, the previously announced and in theory of the seven present rulers should be signed.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed in the sixth ordinary meeting of the leaders of the Unasur. sources in the state and Präsidentenkanzlei told initially that it would hand over the conclave, declared afterwards, however, that there are some time on the site of the peruvian government would be published.
During questions to the text, they gave that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to provide information on the summit was at any time.
During the day, the press room only the image of the Präsidententreffens without reporting the tone with “private meeting, limited audio”.
The few information among the journalists, have been floating around the Pressesprechern present at the meeting of some of the governments of Unasur, but not by the peruvian press secretary.
The only document that during the day, was the list of participating Presidents, with hundreds of journalists in the various national and international media stir unease, which called for more information.
After that, the president of Peru, the media an e-mail with the “final statement” of the summit, but the statement by Humala, and not an official document to the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru, hosting the summit of South America III-arab states (ASPA legislation), and on this occasion, despite strong request by the press the so-called Lima Declaration that had already been announced, just published.
On the official website of the ASPA legislation, we can be confident that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meeting stressed the peruvian authorities that the information systems for the journalists there were limited, but to a large extent, the access to information.
The summit ended with the common commitment of Chile and Peru, a judgment of the Court of Justice in the Hague, which settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the ICJ's decision on Monday in the Hague begins, in the process, the Lima against Santiago, listen to the pleas of both sides.
“We will judge the differences we are currently the International Court of Justice to follow and executing,” said Humala, along with his chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and remains a country that comply with international laws, peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and to the international courts,” adds Piñera added and Humala with handshakes before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ, happened after Colombia after a decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua, it is a serious mistake was to take action against the agreement of Bogotá, which agreed to the judgments of the International Court of Justice.
At the summit, there were the president of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales of Bolivia, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which since 2011 following the ousting of its president, Fernando Lugo of the Unasur is excluded, attended the meeting did not take part.
The host President Ollanta Humala, opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after the lunch time in Lima.
The head of state, read out the final document, which said that 16 decisions and the courses for 31 projects between the south american countries over Investitionsbetrag, out of a total of 17 billion dollars.
The decisions made, he said that the countries of the Unasur “significant steps towards the goal of a south american citizenship, and we will make the decisions on residency rights.”
He said that measures would be pushed to “cooperation in the fight against uncertainty in the cities and organized, transnational crime, and measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America to improve, and in the event of natural disasters and efficiently together to act”.
With the crisis in Europe is “the economic consolidation (in Latin America) no triumphant trains, but should serve to increase our output and our people a better future show,” added Humala added.
“We have decided that a number of 31 flagship projects to give priority to the geographical ties in South America and particularly in rural and frontier areas to improve … and so our countries together and develop new forms of exploitation,” said the Peruvian President in a statement read.
Among those projects would also be five on the peruvian Querachsen its territory from the coast to Brazil would be, and with two for a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
Also took the final document on the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country for his reinstatement in the Union of South American Nations serves,” from the moment it is excluded.
The need for Latin America continue to an integrated region for prosperity and peace, and with good neighbourly relations, was another aspect of the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that he Mexico on Saturday in a meeting with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, expected to the maritime conflict after one of Bogotá in question the ICJ ruling respectfully to treat.
“Perhaps because I will tomorrow (Saturday) with the President Daniel Ortega to meet,” said Santos.
“We will review all these ways-they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua make talks with Nicaragua needed”, it said.
“I hope the President Ortega can say that this matter is so civilized and respectful as possible will be dealt with,” added Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention with the inauguration of the new president, Enrique Peña Nieto to be present.
As part of the summit, also in the run-up to the Secretary of Defense to block the adoption of the action plan for 2013, and the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region should be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members at the UNASUR, even if the latter is currently excluded.
Peru has the chairmanship of the regional bloc.
“America needs to learn in the integration of the citizens,” says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, with “South America actually learn from Europe.”
Correa on 6. summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), participated in Lima, Peru, the state television said that the Europeans “in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing” and “almost a mother country.”
In this sense, he defended the project, a south american citizenship to create the Member States of the Unasur.
“Erreicht must be the free movement of citizens and workers in all latin american countries, as it already is in the Andean Community of the time, however, there is still a reactionary sectors which is aiming for a return to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the reorganization of the Organisation of American States (OEA) below the target, the influence of the Anglo-saxon countries and those that take into account the agreement of San Jose on human rights have signed up.
Those who teach, pledge never to something and, in return, we sign the South Americans all the time.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter Commission for Human Rights, based in Washington, and will be financed by the United States,” he said in reference to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has granted.
Correa said that he did not regret that decision because it will not have betrayed his principles, but his “deep democratic values and views on human rights” has fulfilled.
He added that it had been “well-founded suspicions that Assange be extradited to a third country and procedure was not respected.”
He also criticised the swedish justice system that requires him to have him on its territory because of an interrogation of alleged Sexualdelikts, while “the swedish jurisdiction it via a video conference, on the Embassy of Ecuador in London, may be carried out.”
Correa said that there was a danger that the health and mental state of Assange would be disrupted.
“Since then he has been in our embassy, I have not talked to him, the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious,” said the head of state of Ecuador.
There is a danger, though, that he would take some physical and mental harm because he was trapped in a narrow space and no physical exercises outdoors could carry out.
“That would affect the health of every person,” he added.
Correa has said that the solution to the asylum, Assange since the month of June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London was granted the granting of a Freibriefs which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe's. he stressed that there had been talks with London to resolve the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, the word we use for this case in that it does not have, though, continued talks.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a number of procedures at various european bodies”, he said.
“And if the UK licence granted this morning, I feel that this is finished.”
If Mr Assange in Sweden and the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogated on Skype, as the swedish case law allows and in other cases, is the problem.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to make itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he would not tolerate “the mediocrity, the sinister intention and the lie of the freedom of expression.”
“The worst enemies of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, journalists, but bad for profitability and blackmail,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated themselves that Ecuador not more of such “journalists and not by the bankers or hegemonic and spießbürgerlichen countries dominated”, and, before that, when it comes to re-election a “the revolution will deepen the way forward in the right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to veto against Paraguay in the Unasur dating at least to maintain its next elections, arguing that the body must be “tough and not of opportunism and not as legally verkleideten coup d'état cannot accept,” because it “the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed.”
The President of Ecuador is also keeping the desire of his “other” Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling by the International Court of Justice in the Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, Nicaragua seerechtlichen privileged, with the borders between the two countries to negotiate for “absolutely right.”
Currently, this judgment is not implemented.
It is a problem between a south and a central american state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must in the pursuit of a common path to be overcome.
They must be fully treated so that they will be overcome and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that “it is right for Latin America, international bodies, if both countries pledge to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh.”
With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador in his third consecutive mandate to achieve, he admitted that he “that possibility with a lot of optimism and joy, though it is sometimes very difficult.”
Correa promised that if he would lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such circumstances as unjust in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
“My political movement had the belief that I was the one that likely victory guaranteed, so I have this responsibility,” he said.
If I win, it would be my last period as President, then I retreat from public life.
This is also true when we lose.
“That has been decided,” he said.
Correa also took to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I was just with Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he planned, for a routine treatment went there, and that he expected that after the election campaign again travel to Cuba.
“It is in no way a relapse in the health of President Chavez,” he commented.
The ecuadorean leader, today in Lima on the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) participated in the call for greater regional integration has been completed, in order for a sustainable progress, equality, and security.
A cause of death due to AIDS is now a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the inquiry confirmed that HIV-positive.
“It was as if a bombshell,” he says about the moment he received the diagnosis, the doctor with no discernible success “tried to weaken.”
He hid it in his family.
He chose to be alone with his disease and began to inform itself; and that with such commitment that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV patients of the unity of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 1990s, when it was hard to imagine many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, avoiding even the director of a clinic of the IMSS, to adopt “because it led to a dead end.”
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible that this syndrome also with quality of life to survive.
However, many people are still in the hospital, none of their disease and know where the virus already has harmed and her immune system has run out, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the publication of AIDS in the world, i. e., the date of the first reported cases, means “the great success today that the survival of a patient's treatment in time, and the survival of the general population exactly are the same,” said the head of the HIV-unity of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, although he said that this information in April this year by a reputable scientific publication had been based.
The expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life to the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the beginning of the treatment depended, and that those who do not have greater opportunities are dependent on drugs: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above mean that anyone under the age of 25 years of the diagnosis of HIV-positive, in that sense, “easily 75 years old can be as long as he is under control,” he said.
This progress with properly needs to be reminded that the life expectancy of the Mexicans live an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS by 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report) reduced the ONUSIDA), it is nevertheless true that since the AIDS 60 per cent of the national database covered patients have died.
Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and up to the month of May this year there are 187 deaths; it will, however, be assured that, since 2005, universal access to anti-retroviral drugs.
Why are people still die in that?
I think the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had no problems of supply of the drugs; the problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their Infektionszustand, i. e. in a very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: “nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have an accompanying infection. global mortality can influence, earlier diagnosis, which is why all the people, where necessary, massive screening tests should be offered.”
This proposal are the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida (en) (Coesida Jalisco state committee to AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio to the test at a private laboratory carried out, and it was only because a friend he had made, despite his young age already in the AIDS era, and even the Kaposi Sarkom krebsartigen tumor - (a), as one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and we want to hear anything.
“If I have to die, then it is better to burst” three times, as we say in my case.
The change was designed to improve ernähre me out, I corner well, sport and take the medication.
Today his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
“I am working, doing much to have an active sex lives, but responsible, I respect on my health and that of the other person,” Fabrizio, counts on the agreed with his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to share with his testimony to encourage those who today in the context of the global AIDS day fear.
You should make the test if they belong to the high-risk group, the sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they are already aware of the diagnosis, they have to learn how to live as all the people responsible.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Behind the counter condoms
Between the health programs and the ordinary citizens there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which is the cause of HIV has adopted.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In some places it was “the distribution of condoms actually increased; previously they were individually made, now give us packages with a hundred piece of what is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom,” he said.
The Risikopersonen for new infections are among the young.
“What do you need?” is a common form of social workers, Spottfrage Orientierungspersonal in schools, staff at pharmacies and in the health care system, the young people do not want to expose, assured the correspondent.
He suggested that these inefficient distribution to change the direction; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in Ausgabegeräten in public toilets of institutions, often by young people.
It should not be encouraged promiscuity.
They are not the beer and Motel will be paid, as the Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question of whether, under its management condoms will be distributed.
“Sexuality is not enough; it is best that condoms those closer to the sexual activity”, he got straight to the point.
Key facts of Jalisco
There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV).
The state is seen in National 4. place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV.
92% of Ansteckungsfälle takes place through sexual intercourse, 6% on the blood and perinatal 2%.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because for every registered 4 or 5, there are people who do not know.
After the Court of Appeal judgment of the United States has confirmed that the restructuring of the liabilities of the group Vitro does not recognise, that have a Handelskonkurs in Mexico was reached a pernicious precedent for every national companies with operations in neighbouring created, the insolvency.
You could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies, which the mexican laws allow, in the land of stars and stripes in conflict with international agreements have no validity.
In practice, the judgment on June 15, recognition of the ruling by the judge at the court in Bancarrotas Harlin Hale of the Northern District of Texas, the mexican company the confiscation of their property from the other side of the River Bravo helpless are exposed.
However, the decision opens up the largest Glashersteller in Mexico and, because of inconsistencies in three of the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the cause of the judges pointed out that the creditors in the bankruptcy law of the United States must be subject to the Court of Appeal, says of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first, that the main proceedings for the Handelskonkurs treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation on procedures in default by companies with trans-national profile is not known.
Indeed, for this purpose the Modellgesetz the United Nations for the unification of international trade law created, with the American Law Institute was set up as an arbiter.
Secondly, the judgment that without the votes of the societies after the recognition of liabilities in the liquidation, the branches of Vitro, with its parent company, not the majority needed for the restructuring of the liabilities have been achieved.
But this is the way of the mexican laws recognized.
Indeed, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities from businesses of the group from Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Handelskonkurse) were confirmed.
It is also true that, after deducting the voices of the branches of Vitro creditors, the creditors in the courts of the United States against suing Vitro, i. e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, a majority have reached.
The vote would be 45% to 37%.
This is not taken into consideration by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there are Vitro blame for its difficult situation in 2008 under the severe economic crisis in the United States, the country hits.
For this reason, the Sada family González before the same court of contradiction to the vote in the House, i. e. of all the judges, because only three of them voted.
It is not granted, the Cerciorare-lodged, the review of the procedure by a higher body calls for, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Schwerwiegende in this case is that the court is a document put to one side of the Government of Mexico under the amicus curiae Figura (friend of the court), what the broadcast of Vitro procedure within the framework of the law on Handelskonkurse described, and noting that it is strictly to the agreement signed by the two countries had kept to the chapter on 15 of the bankruptcy of the United States.
It also pointed out that the country was the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade domination, i. e. the rules laid down for the cross-border insolvency, the equality between debtors and creditors.
Zweibandige Karambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.

Héctor “Hetin” Reyes: “basketball was my life.”
The Weltenbummler of Basketballs, Héctor “Hetin” Reyes, was the Korbsport for more than 60 years and has around the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large collection of intellectual history of the country as “Basketballs Héctor Hetin Reyes.”
Before he by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair was Rexes 6 years part of this sport, be it as a player of lower classes, player of the first National League, agent and head of the BSN with the President or the Vaqueros de Bayamón Basketballverbands.
“My whole life I have many basketball donned hats, indeed, several at the same time, when I was President of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and President of the Union was in the 1990s,” recalled Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, where he met his wife, Isabel, trusted for more than 50 years, lives.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes is exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all with photographs and memories of his long career decorated and they show.
In the heart of Bayamón
The emotionalsten memories are those of his time in the Vaqueros of the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, remember where his 15-year anniversary as manager of the club or Mitgeschäftsführer celebrated.
“These were my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of the Vaqueros eight championships since 1967 as a manager or coach, Mitgeschäftsführer be allowed.
It was rewarding for many years, including five finals in succession from 1971-1975.
And then I said with a championship in 1981, the year of the Debüts Jerome Mincy to BSN.
From then took “Cuco” Ortiz, who is a very good manager,” says Reyes.
I remember that my genes Bartow, here as coach and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: “I have a very strong and 2 metres in great players.
Would you use it?”
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow recommended then Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse, acquire and one of our best Werfer was.
I know, even as he said that, if a championship for Mincy Bayamon Gausse, allowing for another.
The championship with the Vaqueros Gausse he was granted, but even from a distance because, in 1988, he is already at the top of the association.
At this time it is, and the executions of Mincy to enjoy in the national team.
I remember when we first vorolympischen at the tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, on the fourth documented bronze, which really should have been, if not this canadian referee would have been the last of us Spielzug repeat for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the World Cup in 1990, the best team you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who used the Olympics in 2004 against the dream team won.
My favorite, however, is the team of the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won the team gold and the United States offered a fight, as when it against us in the World Cup bronze won.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and “Piculín” (Ortiz) once again, but also the young players (Javier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter, the brothers Francisco and León (Edgar) and Mario Morales, the “Quixote” because of a 1990 Knieverletzung could not be present.
A team which, perhaps, in terms of personality, not the best, but we won a gold medal and the us great joy, was the tournament's 1995 vorolympischen in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the blockage of players because of the events in the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, despite every prediction, we won the gold medal.
Who was the best player from Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this without his career in different leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coach as Julio Toro, Patents Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Armandito Dalmau, Torres.
Of the boys, I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you believe is the best of what you have achieved in the club?
I was part of the most successful era for the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s, up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have to do?
There are things that I would have imposed, e. g. the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The boys in Ponce, for example, only in their area, and only in the Playoffs on national teams from other corners of the island.
Today, many of the children unnecessary travel and games.
At least, I see the result of mandatory training and courses for coaches, table-officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What do you do today?
I like to listen to music, see my time in music videos from YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and now and I can go to a Basketballspiel.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth-type figure on (Texas) and has been born worldwide fame with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as “J.R.” in the television series “Dallas,” where he was a ruthless and manipulative, evil businessman played.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the Ölmagnat J.R. Ewing in the television series “Dallas” became a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, which this year as J.R. in a new wave of “Dallas” came back, died Friday afternoon because of Krebskomplikationen according to a press release from the family to the Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of “Dallas.”
“Larry was back in his beloved Dallas native town, where he once again the ikonische role played the most liked him,” said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of Erntedankfestes.
Linda Gray, his wife's role in the original-and Folgeserie played, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate, funny and talented, and I will miss him a great deal.
“He was an original and lived life to the full, trains,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992 with cirrhosis, he admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor in his liver, and he undertook a transplant.
In the years before “Dallas,” Hagman was on television as a nice guy in the years from 1965 to 1970 with the Bezaubernde Sitcom “Jeannie” the broadcaster NBC.
There, he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he is an attractive “Dschinn” hits (played by Barbara Eden), in his own home.
He was also a member of two performers comedy, just a short time were broadcast, for example, “the Good Life” (NBC, 1971-72) and “Here We Go Again” (ABC, 1973).
Kinoarbeiten belonged to his criticism of the well-regarded roles in “the Group,” “Harry and Tonto” and “primary Colors.”
But it was his masterful Interpretierung the charmingly loathsome J.R. that Hagman to a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television network CBS on the Ewing clan and other characters in the environment was from April 1978 to May 1991 broadcast.
The advertising slogan “who shot to J. r .?”, the expectation for an episode full of emotion should create, where the figure of Hagmann almost killed, led to an international speculation and millions of dollars in Wetthäusern wagered.
Thus, in the series a Zuschauerrekord in that time.
As the answer in a chapter in November 1990, she was an average of 41 million viewers saw the “Dallas” in the second most connotation Unterhaltungsprogramm since the end of “MASH” in 1983, the 50 million viewers, had transformed.
It was Kristin, sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) the shot.
J.R. had they geschwängert and threatened to portray them as prostitutes, if they are not left the city, but also others had reasons to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, greedy man with a charismatic smile: a devious businessman and untreuer husband who sought alkoholkranke, his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) einweisen.
“I know what the tombstone one day of J.R. is supposed to be,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should read “here lies the honourable people of J.R. Ewing.”
This is the only business that he has not won.
Victoria Principal, the Mitdarstellerin Originalserie, recalled on Friday to Hagman as “a huge personality and outside on the screen.”
It is for millions of enthusiasts in the world and irreplaceable and unforgettable, who had the good fortune to know him and to love in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of “Dallas” were a few months ago with great success in the TNT broadcast television channel.
The inclusion of five chapters for the second wave was completed, and a sixth chapter has just been shot, told the station.
By Warner or TNT, there was no immediate statement about how the loss of Hagmann in the series would be dealt with.
Born in Fort Worth-type figure on, Texas, he was the son of singer-actress Mary Martin, the classic works such as “South Pacific” and “Peter Pan.”
Martin was still a young people than Larry during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the Theaterbühnen in New York in the early 1950s, after he served from 1952 to 1956 in the air force in England.
There he learned the young designer Maj Axelsson know and they married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
2001 came his memoirs “Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) valley about My Life.”
“I have nothing written that I believed that someone or hurt him in some wise could affect,” said of the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant could thus committed himself to a liver donations and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to help frightened patients.
“I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them if their operations are ahead and then,” he said in 1996.
I wish them a little solace, such as “no fear, it is a little bit awkward the first time, but you will go well.”

The start of the course, the “end of the world” studied
Every week the apocalyptic students studying subjects such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Each semester, if the Religionsprofessor decided a course about the end of the world, he knew that he has an irresistible hooks had: the end of the “long Rückwärtszählung” of the mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed that the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what it in the following two months should expect: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have described as “Deudarmaggedon”, as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which the christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
“I have not noticed that this apokalyptischste semester will be ever,” said Charmé this week the students at Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyses what, in today's world, as if we were 30 days away, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad things well for those with apocalyptic mentality is.
And he is not the only professor who this semester, which is the last in the history, should be started on the “end of the world”.
In the Temple beisitzende Professor Barry Vacker the course “media, culture and the end of the world.”
Every week the apocalyptic students studying subjects such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
“We are analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, and the way that hypothetical scenarios will be offered at a particular human behaviour.
If nuclear materials in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, analyzed the student films with apocalyptic content and ask how they compared with real life compare.
“I tried to inform the students as possible, probably, credible and is impossible,” said Vacker.
At the University of Pennsylvania have Hauptcampus professor of latin american history and his colleague Matthew Restall Solari beisitzende Amara, a professor of art history and anthropology, a team formed a course with the simple title of “the end of the world”.
“We are not in 2012, so we always keep the option, the new course, in the event that the world does not sink,” said Restall.
Despite the “impending doom”, the students study, projects and audits to participate.
In Penh State will be the final exam on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other options, as “until the night work, where the world's supposedly comes to an end,” said Restall.
The courses have been very popular.
“In two hours, there were no seats,” said Restall of its course for students with high average, which is about 35 students filled.
For weeks before Semesterbeginn we received e-mails from students who asked whether more seats.
The students, in turn, to assure that the path to the Interessantesten counts.
“It is exciting to see what people do to themselves to console,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic cults or Religionsmentalität is really just a matter of comfort or its absence.
The 25-year-old student wants Wekesa of psychology and medical care, explained that all the apocalyptic films I have ever seen.
“I never heard anything from a classroom, where it will be informed,” he admitted.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students-and even less-a professor said, to the last date of December 21, to believe.
“Our first project was dealing with the prophecy of the Maya, and in a particular way to discredit them,” said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and in West Chester.
The Maya never said the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that in the western society an apocalyptic fear is that several centuries, than the people on changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world, responded.
The Internet has increased the speculation.
“People think Anderenorts not so,” he says.
This is particularly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a Religionsprofessor La Salle University, which this year in the Philippines to respond quickly to the question of whether he has a course on the “end of the world”.
“The Philippines are not the end of the world,” he wrote to suggest an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days from the last court, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, “the people immediately on a new date,” or think about philosophierten that the December 21, the start of a seven-year period, is that the end of the world.
Students and teachers take this date is easy.
Several said that they have “to celebrate the end of the world” should go.
“May I ask a few friends, so that together we can smile,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
