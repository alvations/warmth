Inflation in Europe, is out of control on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro zone is due mainly has the rapid increase in the price of food.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 countries of the euro zone, has been more important with regard to the forecasts, apres an inflation rate of 2.6% in October, annual inflation 3.1% has been recorded, has indicated the office of the statistics of the European Community located in Luxembourg.
The official predictions have indicated that 3%, has communicated Bloomberg.
Unlike the US central banks, British and Canada, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not gone down the rate of intéret director by saying that the reduction of intérets, with the increase in the price of matieres premieres and reducing the rate of unemployment, would result in the generation of a spiral inflationary.
The ECB wants to maintain the rate of inflation below but close to 2%.
According to one analyst, that is the Catch 22 for the ECB: 'we must deter "inflation in order for no longer has to speak on this subject at a later date.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3% is a record during these dernieres twelve years and in Spain, it is recovered 3.6 has 4.1.
Inflation in the euro zone has left because of the rapid increase in the price of food and energy.
Most of the market has term of cereals have increased by 88% and the course of soya has reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of oil in food and milk products has also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the world price of oil has risen by 52% and, last month, a barrel of black gold coutait almost 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the rate of inflation will rise from 2.1, this year, has 2.5% but, in 2009, it will fall has 1.9.
According to the analysts, the rate of inflation on 12 months still around 3%, however, the 3 has four months, the average annual rate will be 2.1%.
Time in a position, they expect that the ECB has this reduces the rate director twice in 2008.
Indicates a government crisis Gallup
Apres a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Alliance Fidesz (young democrats) has increased significantly in early December and, since 2002, it now has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup poll (European) has never seen before such a low Socialist support, particularly 13%.
For the voters fideles, the difference would be, because the greatest determination of the opposition, the support of more than two thirds (71%) against the support of a cinquieme (20%) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum Hungarian Democrats) and the European Democrats SZDSZ (free) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two per cent in the entire population.
On the voters fideles some to vote, the number of supporters of the two parties has increased by 1%.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous point the lowest, the proportion of those who have judged that the economic situation of the country was particulierement serious has never been as high, it amounts has 41% and according to 46% complement the situation is very serious.
Apres the most optimistic prospects of spring and been recent, families are once again more pessimistic about financiere has their situation.
For next year, the majority of the population is a worsening and only a dixieme provides for an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71% of those sondées, a majority has never seen in previous surveys of Gallup, have judged that the Prime Minister was his work rather bad as well.
13% of those questioned confidence or have a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38% support Viktor Orbán.
54% are not all confidence in the Prime Minister and 27% to the President of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society the belief that the discontent vis-a-vis the Prime Minister Treaty can come without a change of government.
Whereas apres the riots in October, 35% of those questioned wished that the government and Prime Minister remain in office, currently this rate is only 20%; the relative majority (33%) believes that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
Has the question about the intention to vote, 60% of those questioned answer that they would certainly vote and the 20% complementary say that they would probably vote.
In order to make a comparison, for a 'legislative elections organise next Sunday', only 55 per cent of those questioned certainly participation and 15% complementary probably participate. According to the current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74% of people say no to the rights of inclusion in higher education, 79% say no to the costs of consultation and 84% say no to the costs of residence has hospital.
When we look at just the memes proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89% of voters reject the introduction of the rights of registration, the costs of consultation and the costs of residence has hospital.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices of pres twenty percent
The big supermarkets established in the triangle of Budaörs have maintained the average increase in the price of 16% of the year derniere has the difference that this year the rate of VAT has not increased.
Article of Napi Gazdaság (daily Economy)
This year, in the triangle of Budaörs trade, the Christmas Panier normal daily also has risen from 16% on average, an increase of much higher value thousand forints display is in all the big supermarkets.
The price, ‘ which had déja bolted 'in the large stores of food last December, no longer have increased brutally by report has the previous high basic.
However, consumers are naturally shocked to see that Articles purchased far below nine thousand forints the year derniere coutent now more than ten thousand forints.
The Panier newspaper polled in the big supermarkets has exceeded 91 forints, at the very least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And value the highest compared the basket has 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6 800 forints.)
The price of Unicum and fish living have remained virtually at the level of the year derniere, however, the price of turkey net, the nut and poppies have increased considerably.
In the shops, the price of flour and bread has followed the data of KSH (Institut Central of Statistiques) but among Auchan, there has been a lot of a kilo has 139 forints only.
Competition has not gone down the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle included two litres of Coca-Cola, was below 200 forints, it does so coutait 257 forints the bottle is noted.
It empeche that this year, in terms of daily Panier, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheaper.
To apres our calculations, Cora has increased the price of his daily Panier 15% while Tesco and Auchan respectively have increased from approximately 18 and 18%.
Comparing the most expensive basket of the year derniere basket and the cheapest, this year, we note a discrepancy of 12% while the difference between the cheaper to the year derniere and most expensive this year is 21%.
Prices have risen by 1 480 forints on average.
The year derniere, prices have risen by 1 206 forints on average, knowing that the impact of the increase in the rate of VAT was déja noticed in the price of Christmas last year.
This process has been confused trade, the big supermarkets could not determine clearly apply on the margin of products they were unable to provide for the impact of the changing prices on consumption.
(If a trader enumerate badly the rotation of a product, it is in danger of losing a great advantage on the margin adapted has the intensity of trade.)
Because of the change in the rate of VAT, the increase in the price of Panier newspaper has evolved maniere so that the excessive basket the more expensive was more than 1 720 forints has the value of the 2006 so that the difference between the baskets the cheapest was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not if excessive, given that the value of the most expensive basket was in excess of 1 630 forints has that of the year derniere and cheaper prices have risen by 1 284 forints too.
By bringing the two seasons of Christmas, we have seen a catastrophic rise in prices, in less than 20 months the price of articles of everyday consumption has increased by more than 30% in the big supermarkets.
(That does not necessarily confirms the data of KSH: for certain alimentations of premiere need, the Institute of statistics has seen an increase in the price of over 30% in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and the egg.)
According to the daily Panier, this seems almost absurd because the level of price of this product, déja of expensive derniere year, barely has increased by over 10% by report has the basis.
According to the evidence, the providers of meat meal occupy a stronger position that providers egg because they have managed to accept the sharp increase in prices also by the multinationals.
In the 'golden triangle trade, the big supermarkets do not complain, they are constantly good years.
To apres our experiences, the majority of customers do not look at most prices in the three big supermarkets visited.
They achetent whilst quantity, they take the food of long pellets conservation by.
On Wednesday morning important beat have formed the funds of the three big supermarkets because the number of customers has increased suddenly.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many complain aupres multinational companies do not a position poll achieve turnover planned, not only for food but also for Articles of sustainable consumption.
Many hospitals are the economy on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygiene conditions hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, overtiredness medical staff do not help has block infection, says the doctor at the head of the National Centre of epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also the economy on disinfectants
It is not long an infection MRSA has been diagnosed in the service of traumatologie János hospital.
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics has been detected on a man hospitalised result has a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in a position place.
The injured a serious car accident came out of the hospital but little time apres it has to return because an infection MRSA and, since then, doctors have not been able to make a major operation because of the bacterium which lies in its body.
Until 10 December this year, 1 094 hospitalieres infections generated by an agent pathogene multirésistant were declared on national Systeme nosocomiale surveillance, has indicated Karolina Böröcz, a doctor at the head of the National Centre of epidemiology.
That is to say that this is the number of infections caused by an agent pathogene multirésistant which really has been recorded in the hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two thirds of infection (683 infections) have been caused by the MRSA, in other words by the staphylococcus aureus resistant has the méthicilline-oxacilline.
A third of the people are carriers of the bacterium of Staphylococcus aureus (S.A.) in their nose without it develops a disease.
Infections caused by the SA (such as angines, amygdalites, skin infections, infection traumatic) are reacting to antibiotics, they are easily guérissables.
However, if antibiotics are used excessive maniere or inappropriate, bacteria, who responded well to antibiotics, develop a bacterium much resistant to antibiotics which proliférera quickly in the poor conditions hospitalieres.
In the event of provisional malfunction or extended the immune systeme, salmonella may cause serious hospitalieres infections, such that a traumatic infection or a septicémie, on the sick old, small weight or having a weakened body.
According to the doctor director of the hospital János, there is nothing particular MRSA infections, these injuries are parts of the everyday life of hospitals.
Above all, we must not confuse the infection with the outbreak, no MRSA only the or it does not seek, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The company resistant to antibiotics.
'These patients are isolated, carers puts rubber days and masks of protection and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them', said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, patients in hospitals are examined whether they carry MRSA, however the infection cannot always come avoided.
The prélevement the sample is not has the way
The vast majority injuries caused by the MRSA could come prevented but the conditions and the circumstances are not right, in hospitals Hungarian, to prevent the development and spread of pathogenes multirésistants agents, says Karolina Böröcz.
As it is especially in the hospitals and the old people ’ s homes, hospitals should monitor patients in hospitals and isolate MRSA immediately the sick people.
However the microbiological prélevement is not has the way in hospitals Hungarian.
We must be aware that the national club of social security is not financing these examinations.
The majority of cases does not see the day when the infection is detectable MRSA on the patient, said the doctor in leader of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has a rigorous recommendations concerning has the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian directives for the recovery of certain infection and syndromes.
We must make efforts to ensure that the antibiotic therapy is targeted, in other words the examinations should come microbiological made in empecher resistance to medicines but hospitals do not always take into account.
The achievement of microbiological prélevements is even more rare in outpatient care and in the basic care, gave Böröcz Karolina.
Many hospitals are the economy on disinfectants
Scientific evidence suggests that the MRSA proliferent of a patient has another more often by means of the medical staff.
It is therefore vital to wash their hands, to put the ‘ softly softly and protection masks. However serious shortcomings are detected in hospitals too in this area.
The MRSA proliferent by inhalation of mosquito-borne infection called and by contact. However, because of the conditions in the Hungarian hospitals, the patient contaminated cannot always come isolated.
Furthermore, the board rooms are often full, the beds are often too pres each other when in terms of epidemic, the sick should come divergent of at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also note that hospitals, financiere difficult situation and make savings on disinfectants, they lack infirmieres, patients are many, and the risk of contamination is even greater, has indicated Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are complied with, the number of infections is weaker of demonstrable maniere or even the proliferation of the agent pathogene can come blocked.
Project against the MRSA government
The treatment of infection MRSA represents exorbitant expenditure for the coffers of social security, which is why we fight against it.
In England, for example, the government has established a programme to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to information published, this programme is effective and infection MRSA show a falling trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reveals among its priorities, the prevention of the incidence of agents pathogenes multirésistants (as the MRSA also) and the prevention of hospitalieres infections caused by these agents pathogenes.

Bulgaria, paradise of the property market of the EU
The development of the property market of Bulgaria is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is looking to the countries of the Balkans little mentioned in the past.
What, or which achete on the EU market which is always the cheaper but which will soon become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re / Max.
Currently, in property, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the target the most in vogue in Eastern Europe with its ski flats and its houses on the brink of the sea cheap.
In the mountains, the regions are the most popular Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, at the edge of the sea, Albéna, the 'golden Sables', 'the Ivory sunshine', the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly numerous has seek a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik too.
According to the analysts of Re / Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the midland region of the country, particularly Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, also the matter of intéret investors and they are also increasingly has buy in the corner of cheap of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers opportunities attractive also, areas of shops and offices promise the rate of refinancing the higher.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive Golf paradise of Europe and thus come at a priority destination, apres summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
Investors more vigilant achetent déja in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to the analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria seek a position in time has to change their lives, their way of life.
Most of the purchasers are English but other come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly of Romania.
The Maltese investors and of Cyprus are also present; on the brink of the Black Sea and the most well-known ski resorts, we have traditionally many Russian buyers.
Buyers foreigners fall into three groups, said Georgiy Jankov, regional director of Re / Max Bulgaria.
People who rely settle achetent refurbished buildings, has a price that varies between 50% and 100 000 euros, or old houses in ruins, has a price, ranging from 5 EUR 15 000, which are then renovated.
Those are the criteres acces easy and the possibilities of communication, the proximity of great city, shops and generally the local doctor.
The second group includes purchasers second houses (since December, Bulgaria is cited among the 10 premieres holiday destinations in Germany).
The troisieme group is made up of commercial investors achetent in the hope of achieving an added value in the medium or long term.
The price of the buildings of the capital is increasing constantly because of an increasingly strong.

Fodor and the six per cent Hungarian
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister for the Environment and water, the meetings of workers are achevent Tuesday, however, Wednesday, apres official opening negotiations of Ministers on the system of the international climate apres 2012 will continue.
The experts and politicians arriving from 192 countries of the world will consult on the road Feuille in Bali supposed to define the efforts to apres the period of reducing emissions defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, lively discussions are held on this subject between developing countries and the developed countries.
The United States have also pointed out that, for the moment, they do not wish to discuss the exact figures, though they were prets has to sign an agreement on the reduction, until 2020, of gas emissions has greenhouse effect of 25 has 40% compared with 1990.
Another important subject of the conference is to see if the developed countries are committed outside the reduction of emissions, has financiere and technical assistance to countries in need.
An agreement has been signed on aid has also provided to developing countries.
The aid funds defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a management board composed of 16 members probably in the framework of the global fund for the environment of the UN (GEF) communicated Piac és Profit (Marché and Profit).
The six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for the Environment and water, confirms the ambition of the EU to retain its role of flagship in the overall efforts designed to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister has explained that the EU has before 2020 undertook to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases is 20 percent of the stage reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the Agreement ’ to ‘ apres 2012, and she was prete restrict right has the 30% if the other large parts of the world and / or the developing countries were also prets has take suitable has their responsibility and their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor has pointed out that in 1997, the countries that have signed the Kyoto Protocol had covered in total a reduction of 5.2% and all the 15 Member States of the EU to that time has made a commitment to 8% less.
Hungary has taken the commitment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases is 6% compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil his commitment, recalls the press release of Ministere the environment.
The stakes are high has Bali because the international agreement on the long-term climate policy must come introduced in the meantime to two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed apres 2012; in this case, the reduction commitments below the values laid down in the Kyoto Protocol are not followed immediately to a new international systeme for reducing emissions, the need for which has been highlighted in the new report by IPCC, international scientific body, which has won the Nobel Peace Prize of the UN, would be in charge of climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the earth of more than two degrees celcius could no longer come avoided which, according to the scientists, would have consequences extremement serious and irreversible.
The British army recruited on YouTube

These registrations, taken has the support of so-called mini cameras mounted on the headphones, are monitored at the headquarters of the operations of the air force has Kandahar and they are then transferred in London or the work of the Dutch public on the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable
The soldiers of the air force have déja past 139 events on the Net in this way and their 'chain has been perceived by more than 75 000 people.

The propaganda published by this approach does not coute virtually nothing compared with the usual recruitment advertisements past has television, has communicated has the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, consultant defence; instead, it is also a political message inevitably since it justifies under a special form the validity of military operations decided by the government.
The Americans have done a
The army is embetée because, apart from the mixed and videos being censored carefully, videos fans have gone on the site of shares that are also, for example, the death of soldiers: in the official propaganda films ‘ ’, a little hypocritical, officers do not avoid losses to speak but they are never the bloody side of the struggle.
Moreover, many were déja videos on the Net presenting the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan which were carried out in real task, but the British army once again spiral out of control for the loading of such material for a short time.
The Americans are the recruitment slightly differently in using the game of shooting Army téléchargeable plugged charge. In this game player directly can be put in place of soldiers in the framework of a more or less genuine simulation.

Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard has increased the risk country
According to the League of risk analysis of Political (Risk Capital Analysing League), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, last aout, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for better Hungary) increases, in many respects, the political risk of Hungary and of the region.
In his ‘ warning of risk ', society indicates that, in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest risk is déja policy that has the short term ethnic confrontations aggressive may occur result has the worsening of the ethnic tension between the existing déja Romany population and not Gypsy Hungary ’.
The research institute has added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard aimed probably has cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, it is because of one of the main gaps in Hungarian political players: ‘ the public players have passed the public debate on the matter of the Roma to the representatives of the political groupings radicals and extremes which have a political strategy based on the dispute between Roma and Hungarians ’.
The probleme worsened, the normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of the aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
According to the Institute of research, to the attention of the media and the Hungarian international activity of the Hungarian Guard 'has deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially concerning the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country'.
They recall that following has greater publicity given has the reorganisation of extremes radical groups and Hungarian Right since the autumn of 2006, numerous associations have been set up in Hungary since summer 2007 is giving the name of ‘ national association of self-defence ’.
‘ The common feature of these meetings is that they are defined as a civil organisation when they say publicly the preparation of their members has defence missions (disasters, national defence, defence of the next), armed if necessary, moreover, that the inability of the police, the army, in other words of the state ', have added.
They have said that everything was happening in accordance with the method which is based on the society motivated by malice of politics and of parties, seeks has disguising various political ambitions in a civilian aspect.
The emphasis placed on the civil caractere and the statute of association is that not only has the legal pieges registration of these associations to court but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis shows that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor which is also increasing the risk in relation to neighbourly relations.
‘ These months, many neighbouring countries the Hungarian Guard cite as a potential source of risk and political actors ultranationalists of some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy in referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region ', have added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phénomene in Central Europe of the East, the political risks have increased on the whole of the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard looks like, for example, has the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard that the constitution has been declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in aout 2007.
The great turmoil of Roma that have occurred in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the Constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
In taking advantage of these events the BNU decided to form a guard in saying that the objective of the organisation is ‘ national self-defence ’.
According to them, these 17 dernieres years the Romanies have ‘ terrorised 'Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They have added that the initiative aroused lively debates in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration of certain organisations of Roma from Bulgaria concerning the establishment of their own guard by way of resistance note the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard does not rule out that the Roma and Hungarian react has the threat of a position by organising their own maniere self-defence, can we read in the warning of risk of Political Capital.
At the request of information of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, Director of search for Political Capital - said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the institution of research.
As he said, their analysis of risk is published every year and occur if events which could have an impact on the change of risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case, in issuing a warning of risk.
The fete is not characterised by red everywhere
In Hungary, the law lays down precisely the days of fete and around fetes, it has been common practice to reorganize the working days, whose number will diminish next year.
The fetes are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
The Hungarian legislation distinguishes the days of national fete and state as the day of rest.
The rest days are often associated with religious fetes or has important and historic events.
In Hungary, we fetons the new year, the last day of the year ends and the first day of the new year are also rest days, this latter especially for the réveillonneurs can relax calmly.
Furthermore, in a year, we have in all eleven fetes marked in red.
On 15 March is a national fete, in commemoration of the 1848 revolution, as on 23 October which is the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
The 20 aout, we fetons the constitution of our state, on 1 May is the fete of work and the 1 and 2 November, we remember the members of our family and our friends who died.
In addition, we have two days has Easter, has Pentecost yet and has Christmas.
The days of our fetes of state, national or religious rarely still falls on a weekend, according to the timetable, it became course reorganising the working days in cases or there is only one working day before or apres fete marked in the red.
It is true that we are paying the price of the weekend applause working or by going has school on Saturday before the weekend extended.
For many years, the Minister of work in a statue particuliere regulation on the days of replacement of days before or after the fetes.
The law is extended to all employers and for all their employees employees, of the officials and on the people who work in the public service.
It is not, however, of the societies of services, the institutions turning point without interruption and service, by their vocation, and also for the rest days.
This year, the days of work will be modified only around the end of year fetes: as 24 December, life is arrete almost throughout the country because, according to the experience the majority of people rather overtime or takes holidays they have saved has these purposes in order to move the days between Christmas and the New Year of home.
Next year many fetes fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in terms of working days compared with this year.
The timetable will be reorganized the premiere time around the fete of work to enable employees to stay at home four days of affilé.
The Samedi 25 April will one day to work for having a day of rest on Friday, 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: on Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing the Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year looks for fetes because as 24 December, everyone will make a pause non-stop a position if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six points futile which can embeter terribly the collegues
E-mails that we forget to send messages that we do not receive instructions, lies innocent people who we agacent almost more: these are things that ‘ 'least bit the everyday life of a place of work.
The question is whether we have trouble getting used these or releve the challenge and deliberately avoids situations ambiguous, causing the trouble to others.
The examples.
‘ Excuse-moi, I forgot to tell you that we who called the marketing 'service, and a collegue said.

We are moving slowly in the usual matters in the morning.
Everything has suddenly particuliere melody vocal has radio: the voice of a violin has which electronic effects are involved.
I rise on his.
Music to exchange rate and the low comes to accompany the shade of any now, then a female choir comes join as a neat bit true.
Widespread Mr2 the song Wings of Love 'of Zagar.
The Hungarian music did point spoiled for a long time with an electronic pop good quality.
Now it seems that matters is different if you the new album of tapping Zagar.
The emergence of Yonderboi, the few new interesting production over the Hungarian digital underground slowly has little has changed the overall picture and, in spite of the new method of side-tracked tearing rock the guitare, the Hungarian électropop proves that there is the new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs lui-meme and it plays in the group of Yonderboi before it embarks on its own way, peut-etre because ‘ there is no place for two feet in a shoe a position '.
Its project (Zagar) and music, included a to jazz of electronic dansante pop music and, has started to make known when it has entrusted the composition of soundtracks filmed (buy
The season of Ferenc Török).
The training playing at the beginning in small clubs has come off known by a greater public when the magazine wan2 quoted their first album of 2002 among the most important market discs Hungarian and declared Zagar, with Yonderboi, almost only the creators of the Hungarian trend which would also be competitive has the west.
Zagar and a whole are undoubtedly become ‘ trendy ’ but nobody asked whether they wanted to bring this label.
The group has reacted properly, it has emerged a new and better tune.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, emerged recently, can open up new paths for them, although the title would represent continuity with the years has Pécs.
It is that it was a line of the former group of Pécs of Balázs Zságer.
We are well with the reference to the flight but alongside air music is now, according to the spirit and the tendency of the time, the guitare stronger, impact of rock- 'n' -roll.
Ligeti György, singer currently working in the United Kingdom with the Group The Puzzle, has shown his talent in these songs during the premiere album of the Parc millennium.
On the album, there is a true summer hit radio, mr2 Petõfi, broadcast from little popular music from morning to night, began has introduce the songs of Wings of Love 'registered with six Hungarian chanteuses (' Underground Divas').
Everything is therefore (?).
Hvg.hu has asked questions has Balázs Zságer.
Hvg.hu: this new has required leads me to ask a question: is your music is far remained music aimed some fog?
Zságer Balázs: the end of music aimed some ozone do not tell me great thing.
In my view there are two castes in music légere; not mainstream or underground, no alternative pop music or but trade and sincere music.
The music itself saying alternatives, underground can also come mediocre and made solely to sell them and thus become commercial.
However, a good can come pop song sincere too.
The attitude of receipt works in this spirit independently of the language or frontieres.
Hvg.hu: do you see a difference between the Hungarian public and foreign, is one or the other is more open has your music?
Zs.B.: abroad, especially has the west music légere has more old traditions.
The people go to the concerts and not only young people of a dozen or vingtaines years but also the elderly.
They are with much more attention to the changes in the music légere because they think that it is also part of contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: what is the role of the public in your work?
Es-tu interested to know which, and how many people listening to your music?
Zs.B.: I am of course glad to see that people are increasingly has our concerts.
However we have never done of music to the market.
For us the music is not made to achieve a goal but for a particular reason.
The role of the public is more important to the concerts or mutual influence works déja but it is perceived in the elusive changes at the time.
However, I have noticed that if you wanted to respond to the expectations of the public, you are more interesting.
Hvg.hu: will you Auditors follow the example of Yonderboi?
It works alone and has carriere rather has the west.
Zs.B.: we do not follow the route sometimes really a position if some are trying to find traces in our music.
We are rather players in the team which have confidence in the presence of the music and let us be deployed.
At the beginning, it was of course inevitable that our music is compared has that of Yonderboi because we are several has leave her group and has to take a different path.
Hvg.hu: on the palmares of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love 'occupies the premiere place.
Many people have heard the name of Zagar for the premiere time by means of this song.
With this style more popular you opened consciously towards a broader layer?
Zs.B.: we did not intend to make a to be able to sell records.
This obviously means more things.
We have sought to the of the final album to try to mitigate the blood-letting orgy and the themes sounds more difficult addressed in any records.
Hvg.hu: how do you chose the six chanteuses?
Why they – what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: the idea was to have a choir of gender gospel.
We have had the idea of putting together this choir of good solistes the scene Hungarian music.
It was composed the choir has six members, has know Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, what has been described Underground Divas then.
Hvg.hu: you wanted this song like it or girls have changed a little?
Zs.B.: this part was déja for a long time in a version instrumental and then when we have made up the album, we thought it was still missing something has this song.
The result of agreements has drawn the voice of the song.
I have sung the night a position that the tune girls have learned later.
I have had almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that this has galvanised me at the time but sure we took the Divas.
With my voice it would not have been a position strength.
Hvg.hu: on the record and also the concert it seemed to me that girls were arriere plan.
There is no aria (with the exception of a short of individual Judy Jay), they are not only role, they are singing all together and they do not sing stronger than music, therefore the music is not something that accompany them.
They were derriere on the scene too.
Is wanted?
Zs.B.: the fact that they were arriere plan is the only has the technical problemes.
However, what was voluntary, that is that we have not wanted to distribute the solo roles.
The song also said that we must forget a little our egos, forget who has just or going or, it must be just that these wings the wings of love, we are carrying.
I wish that other are aware of this state euphoria that we have felt when the song is born.
Hvg.hu: songs of you has made the most work?
Zs.B.: in fact, no on the process of musical creation we had bits more difficult in the mixture.
For example, with Dorian Dilemma Gray' if, or a piano plays together, or with Rock' n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove did not want to work for a long time, and then, small, everything is put in place as in a jigsaw.
Hvg.hu: what is your view on the new album preferred?
Zs.B.: this changing all the time with the concerts and of the fact that I have déja ‘ yield this blue ’.
At the moment, these are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The perfidious tradeur has risked billions because of its inferiority complex
A recalcitrant taxpayer dissimulateur.
It appoints its former used the French giant general Company, the owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank has lost due to almost five billion.
Yet it seems rather than Kerviel is a major player who wanted to match his colleagues, and which, furthermore, can in no way be seen as incapable.
Contrary to all the giant bank, it has acknowledged in time the market crisis of American mortgages.
'It is fragile', has indicated his superior who have reported to the police.
However, if we stick to the evidence of Kerviel reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced at the end of last year a profit of EUR 1.6 billion.
The crisis goes beyond the United States
'Everything what I wanted to, it was earn money for my bank', he says in the evidence.
Last summer, he has managed to take advantage of the American crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, it felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
Information has begun to emerge in February that mortgages say 'sub-prime', granted to customers on low incomes or those who had met in the past of the difficulties of reimbursement, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole of the economy.
Kerviel do not believed in it and it has banked.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
'I had won my first half, I did not know how to announce', entrusts Kerviel and would add that he did, of course, nothing to itself ’.
In all the interrogation, it admits have distorted the reports not to be uncovered.
He has managed to mislead his superior, although the stock exchange Eurex started to look at its transactions.
Who do nothing has no complaints risk
Craignait-il to be discovered?
Rather not.
'I felt that the mere fact of having obtained 1.6 billion for the bank would meet them.'
Why has its willingness to risk if major?
It has not reached its post gradually.
It began to work in the General Society in 2000 having just ended its studies at the University of Lyon.
Its annual salary revolved around 51 000 dollars.
Two years later, it was already assistant to tradeur and, in 2005, it became independent tradeur with an annual salary of 90 000 dollars.
However, he knew that it will never gain as much as the others.
'from my initial meeting in 2005, I knew that I was much less regarded as the others.
In the light of my university curricula and of my professional experience and staff ', clarified Kerviel investigators.
However, shortly after its entry into office, it achieves its first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz actions, it won half a billion euro building on the reduction of this title in the London bombings.
And the mechanism was triggered - it wants more.
As long as you gagnes, left in peace you
'It was as a cascade effect,' he said to the police.
But the were aware of all, or rather, they were.
"All I gagnais, they were semblance of close our eyes'.
Well, that is when does the scope of the beginning of the year.
It loses EUR one billion in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, it decides to conceal the sum.
On Monday, when it comes to work, it is no longer employee of the bank.
A few days later, the bank announcement that it has lost 5 billion due to him.
And how is it that has discovered?
It has become suspicious because of its holidays.
'The last year, I was only four days of holidays.
A trader who does not take a holiday is a trader that does not leave his book to another ', concludes Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the Ministers of the Czech Government signed in all nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the years to come, make 14 000 million (approximately SEK 365 billion Czech) to the Czech Republic.
It is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can achieve in Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Almost EUR 125 billion kronor from seven operational programmes will be for the Czech regions.
The Czech companies can obtain around 100 billion kronor in the framework of the programme Enterprise and innovation.
The transport sector will receive the largest part, up to 150 billion.
The programme Transport operational programme is the most important and is up to 22% of the financial resources that the Czech Rép. can achieve in the context of these projects.
This money is at the root of an increase in the budget of the national fund of transport infrastructure which will deal with next year EUR 93.4 billion kronor.
The programme Enterprise and innovation for SMEs and to entrepreneurs, must serve to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain the financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new methods of management more efficient.
Until now, the Czech Rép. was part, among the new Member States, the beneficiaries of the EU of the less successful.
The Court has confirmed the trouble to 20 years in prison for former President of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua has confirmed on Thursday worth 20 years in prison for the former president of the country Arnold Alemán, which he has been condemned in 2003 for a fraud of USD 100 million (approximately 1.8 billion kronor).
However, later he has been released and lived under house arrest in his hacienda around the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of that state centre-américain, depending between 1997 and 2002, will be to new encarcéré is at the moment, according to the PA government agency, not clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will depend on now prison officers, or they will leave Aleman finish his sentence at home, or will be new in prison.
There are four years, the Court has proved Alemán, regularly spill shifted the money from the government to the accounts of foreign companies to Panama.
It was fictitious companies and the accounts were in fact the members of his family and his supporters in the same region.
Some of this money has gone into the funds that Alemán, spill was created in order to fund its election campaign in 2001.
We adopted the budget
It is.
The state budget has been adopted.
What exceptional is this budget?
It is the first budget designed by the government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
Anyone for the current year is spent a year from the Socialist Party supports the Czech ČSSD, since it is the Minister Sobotka had prepared and ČSSD could not afford its refusal.
Unlike the heated debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, on this occasion, nothing dramatic.
The Congress of Deputies approved without any problem this law which, although the most influential, is usual neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
We like it or not, each chapter and every article constitute the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, albeit hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
It is thus more attractive and that is why we give more attention in the media.
Arguments of politicians much more interested in the belief that the figures rash.
The national budgets of the socialist governments are suffering from past three evils that the current budget is not able to solve both:
The first is the important part attached to the costs of mandates imposed by law, set up not only by the pensions, but also by the social costs, adopted last year by the coalition 'silent, encompassing the parties ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is an economy in deficit, a result of the first badly.
The third obstacle is represented by the deficit of public finances, i.e. by the deficit of towns and communities.
However, this is not the deficit of the state budget which represents the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of towns and municipalities.
Many mayors often expressed in étourdis, obligations, disproportionately endettant their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, the tax laws and bank loans, new sources of investment.
In the past, they managed to repay this debt by the sale of actions of mass distribution systems, especially those of energy, obtained the rule in the framework of privatisation.
Today, they do not have this souce.
If we stick to the official and verifiable facts alone, we see that:
Our economy is already going through for several years, like the rest of the world, a period of growth and ČSSD never fails to venter.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularise the public finances.
However, instead of this, they endettaient the rule more and more.
Other countries, barring a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs so as to be much more reasonable that our Republic.
It is a disgrace monstrous which falls mainly on previous governments.
We are part of the countries which, on a global scale, are the least threatened by poverty.
We have no need of massive social programmes which have, precisely in recent years, unfortunately enflés unnecessarily.
Although it has managed to remove some of the expenditure populists absurd, approved last year before the elections, if a discrepancy of the age limit for retirement, so that a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country, and anyone who is in power, it will administer.
In éxagérant, we can say that the politicians will become bureaucrats méchaniquement distributing the majority of money imposed between pensions and social security benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that fact that the ordinary costs are rejected by the cost of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion planned for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not taken away all the money that they could.
If we really do not want that sometimes the policies in power becoming tradable bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this government coalition fragile, aware that the State can only spend the equivalent of what happens to levy taxes and tax laws, calm necessary for the preparation of new laws of reform.
There is that these recent which will allow us to achieve a balanced budget gradually state.

The banks want to resolve the crisis
The US Federal Bank reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks English, Canadian Swiss and decided to jointly combat the crisis of the financial markets.
More than USD 100 billion will be placed on the money markets by the intermédiare of auctions.
It will be for the banks to sell, by a system of auctions, interest rates auquels they are prepared to borrow money.
For example, the American Federal Reserve will send at auction USD 40 billion and, furthermore, it will provide 24 billion to the European central banks and Switzerland.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11. September that the central banks of individual States have decided a concerted action at this point, in order to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
This approach is intended to resolve the major problems of the economy, namely the lack of free capital that banks could pay ', writes in his report to clients Baumohl Bernard society's Economic Outlook Council Group.
'The concerted action of central banks has diminished the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65% to around 50%', adds Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already lost USD 60 billion because of loans not reimbursed, especially the United States.
There are still other analysts losses in billions.
'If the central banks have chosen this approach is that they should really understand what more can ensue,' says the chief economist ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
'It appears that the situation is very bad', likely.
The central banks fear that, if the banks themselves have a difficult access to loans, they will pay more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce the consumption and would plunge the American economy in recession that can influence the economic growth of the entire world.
The central banks have chosen after that we have not managed to drive the inter-bank rates of London, called LIBOR, used to take on the interbank market.
This means that the banks feared always mutual loans, despite the fact that the US central banks, have been reduced by Canada and English several times during the autumn, their interest rates.
This will have the same effect that a further cut in interest rates, 'says the Reuters news agency Greg Salvaggio Tempus Consulting society.
Certain analysts do not believe that the approach of the central banks not contribute to ward off the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem which is the fall of the property market to the USA.
The President Klaus: the debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change are supposed to harm above all to the developing countries.
The President Vaclav Klaus again expressed its opinion on the problem of global warming.
The criticism has crashed down this time on the UN international conference on climate change staining in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The blue planet, not green, he stated that the debates of the Greens were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, constituted by a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organisations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the accompanied rhetoric and reality.
'The debate is not structured at all, this is only a fusée of words, substitute solutions to the current problems', said Klaus.
The President of the Czech Republic has stressed, during the presentation of his book, that it has a great importance and that is why it is committed to this cause.
It has also expressed its satisfaction that his book also appear in the German translation, since, he said, 'I do often meeting that the caricature of my views'.
From now on, the interested parties can read its positions without that they are distorted.
Klaus pointed out that although it is not a weatherman, however, it has, in his opinion, enough of provisions for producing such a book.
It is indeed a was able to follow and assess the Treaties scientists, it has the practice of the statistics and it is also economist.
The major conclusions of books are, according to him, the arguments: the climate is changing constantly, the changes it is normal, there is not a view shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too important, nor too serious, they do not represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made in order to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably too expensive.

Polívka has lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka has lost the dispute about the trademark Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it is he who was used for the first time the title King of Valašsko, but the project has been set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, a former member of the operator.
Polívka was not present at the hearing today.
However, according to his lawyer, the matter is probably not over and client will appeal.
'The dispute concerns the fact that Mr Harabiš and his team parasitent on the popularity of Bolek Polívka, "said after the trial of Polívka lawyer.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko talk to everyone precisely this actor and comical.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
'There is a work of almost ten years ago.
Money for research and development of events' he said.
According to him, that is the money which is the cause of the dispute.
'after the years they have realized that the project was successful and that they may benefit.
It is they who want parasiter on our work ', he said.
A lucrative business
According to the Court, it is Polívka who has used for the first time the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) in a television programme.
The Radoslav player Brzobohatý was crowned King in 1993.
However, at the time, there was no connection with the proposal to set up a shadow kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of making seem passports of Valašské Království.
A humorous action originally ultimately a lucrative business and a commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, society Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka has accepted that his name and its signature should be named in the passport and it has even proposed to holders of balances on the price of the visit of its firm and its performance of theatre.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge has also mentioned that Harabiš has simply use the idea naked, published by Polívka in the emission manéž, for commercial purposes.
'The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainemement has helped the project Valašské království, "said the judge.
It has added, however, that the soul of the project was constituted by Harabiš and his team who were the project intensively.
The cooperation between the parties enemy today continue until 2000 when Harabiš organised for Polívka coronation Vsetín an official.
But after that conflicts began to gather between Polívka has Harabiš, which culminated with the statement 'of King Boleslav 1 elected for always ’.
The leading role in the kingdom was then, inspired by Harabiš, assumed by the Jarmila singer Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka has filed a complaint against Harabiš and its society, demand that the Court has now rejected.
What could clarify the matter is tennis envisaged for the throne and a half of Princess.
It should leave a new king.
It would not yet betray the details and the date.
'We do not want to move fast.
That would be as the parade of kings as to Slovácko.
The King would be elected for some time.
Even Mr Polívka can of course be ', has added Harabiš.
Test of a Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: diparition prejudices
In fact, I have never been a great fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rotating qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, of the conduct and also the manufacture could, in many ways, be voting to below the average.
Now, currently there are on the market his successor a Peugeot 207, which is much better.
Especially as the combi appointed SW goes a step further, it only remains for me to reflect.
When I testais the classic hatchback Peugeot 207 I am plaignais for example of space for the head on the seats of behind.
While there over complaints because the bodywork combi means that even the large wretches are, in this respect, comfortable.
Will see quick
I shall refer very quickly inside and without repeating too much.
It is a Design roughly succeeded, my only comment on the central tunel which is poor.
Here, I would have liked to design a little more inventive, given that the car sounds so elegantly.
The seats are comfortable and the time when we could complain of seats or dossiers too short is over.
The guidage latéral has also considerably improved compared to the model 206.
With regard to the area, the increase of the dimensions of the bodywork is sensitive here too.
The combi disappear also sees the lack of place over the head already mentioned.
In the boot a
The most important thing about this vehicle, it is its soutte to luggage.
I have to consider it as very well accessible (also thanks to the ice pivotante back) and a rather easy devices.
The indiscriminate spaces are in possession of elastic to ruling, which constitute a compromise ideal.
It is not burdensome and can be extended whilst being able to take objects asez vehicles.
But let us stop us in volume.
This fact, according to the tables, 428 the basic shape, which is in relation to competition rather means.
Apart from the Skoda Fabia Combi, vehicle as sold in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, we see that the Peugeot remains very much behind, the difference being to 52 litres.
When it comes to go on holidays abroad or to commission a buggy, this figure is almost criticism.
But, if I had to highlight the benefits, I would mention the cash below remaining after the overthrow of the files of the rear seats perfectly right, or a very low marche-pied.
120 horses distributed its cylinders on four
The car that we have tested fitted with an engine Otto four its cylinders, with a volume of 1.6 the power and a of 88 KW.
In fact, that is what should have been like a 1.6 which stimulates a family hatchback.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it takes well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Skoda which often gives the impression of having a exhaust pot closed by a serpillère, then I cannot be more than welcome.
If we examine the tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a car quite well equipped with a spacious internal and a very good engine.
The price of a vehicle with an engine Otto 1.4 litres totalling ECU 329 900 Kč is still is satisfactory.
The vehicle that we have tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is bad enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increasing the price of 80 000 Kč.
However, we have prepared and more airbags head, an automatic air conditioning, automatic essuis-glace, of an order automatic rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs in the end 531 900 Kč.
This is very much, but try to add at the price of the Fabia extra equipment and you will get a very similar figure.
It is therefore more than to choose the brand.
The integration of the Slovak pupils in schools britaniques are going badly
The number of children from the countries of Eastern Europe in schools britaniques is increasing, which causes the demeurants concerns about the development of the local education.
The integration of Europeans of the is, for the moment, to a series of obstacles.
Schools britaniques find even cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the inhabitants of origin are turned into violence.
The case of Kent in the north, where are beginning to widen the conflicts demeurants and opponents of immigrant Slovak origin illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The disputes, the victims and the fights between pupils are transposed in relations between the parents.
The situation has gone so far that the police arrested at Chatham a Slovak woman affecting with an iron mark a pupil agé of ten years ago.
The culprit is defended by saying that the boy was insulted by saying something rasistes.
The police has also had to intervene following the attack against a Slovak immigrant girls being pursued by two.
Young girls had allegedly sent to this man of racist remarks and cast stones.
"If you arrived hot-foot at home, a person has risen on the arrest of buses and has started to spit them.
When I told him to stop, it has responded by apples and pears and then it has found its fesses', has described another unpleasant venture a mother of pupils Slovakian.
The complaints are made by both parties.
One of the demeurants went so far as to describe the conflicts with immigrants to fight for survival.
The cases mentioned above testify that the atmosphere in schools britaniques between the inhabitants of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
Seventy thousand Slovaks come to find work are registered in Great Britain.
Slovakia and approximately 30 thousand students attend schools britaniques.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Everything that you expect your holidays can be achieved if you are a good choice.
The white gold beaches and as the snow, high vague or even a calm seas as a Etang.
The palmes and inclusive All with you on the beach servers offering a pizza, of the ice or enivrants drinks receptions.
The kitesurfing, the and the golf roulette.
On the islands of the sea of Caraîbes, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find even more and that is Cuba, the greatest and most beautiful island of Grandes Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus described it as the best place as the human eye has never seen.
Havana became the tabling and the place of transferring the treasures that Spaniards had stolen and that they take in Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the very beginning of the 1920s.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the mafia, which was built, because everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was recognised and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Parmis its customers, there was, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
Has Havana, buildings at heights led and cars, belonging to the symbols of the 1950s cults' of the last century, had on the broad avenues.
Ernest Hemingway has bought a property in San Francisco of Paula, almost Havana and, to Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the showbusiness and politicians of the entire American leaves their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And today then?
You can leave yourself conventional you on the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury hotels, you mixera the cocktail of your choice.
And these cars circulating always cults in Havana, since the jigoulis and fiats imported once have already long since, in a climate if salé and wet, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the part the oldest, decrepit is significantly, nullepart elsewhere in the region are there so many colonial monuments splendid that there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Given that tourism is the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
During the last fifteen years, new hotels led not only Havana, but above all to Varader, on the coast of the province Holguín, and also on the small islands such as Cayo Coco Guillermo Cayo and others.
Cuba is proposing a vision which is unique in the world, and which will be appreciated in particular by lovers of small trains.
The cane plantations was returned since the extended in sugar factories on a very narrow path by small steam train and engine.
Their equipment has not been renewed for decades and it is thus that we can see on the march of small engines which are only contemporary elsewhere in museums.
Where direct its not?
The majority of visitors do not lack the best-known places.
There is therefore no need to write a lot about Varadero or in Havana.
Otherwise remind you that in the ownership of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that anyone who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Viňales west of the island is one of the corners of the most fanciful of Cuba.
Is a exhubérante vegetation there on ground chalk.
The mogotes, balloons calcaires and rocks of worthwhile right in the substance of the valley, and of the fertile land are being taken in their sandpits, even its rotting rock are covered a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is where tobacco is grown Cuban probably the best quality.
You can meet the final shape of this product if you visit one factory Havana cigar.
Someone may also interesting that this is that was turned the Chilean episode of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
Ancient city based shortly after the Spanish have colonised peoples the island.
It is the market the slave trade and that of sugar, which have made the glory and wealth.
The wealth is embodied in the beauty and the ville-vitrine nature of this city of limited size.
Koloniální španělská architektura, výrazně ovlivněná pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky, za čtyři staletí téměř nezměnila.
Trinidad between the sea and the shelter Escambray mountainous, is a place to point out that even in the 1950s is of the last century, there was no way to run from this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation enabled it to remain side.
It was we do nothing, and that is why we do not démolissait nothing, each confined itself to have a roof over their heads.
If it has, Trinidad, more time than one afternoon, then it is worth see also places interessants in the region, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the valley of Sucreries.
Then, the evening, it is usual to go to the Casa the Música who drives after the sleep of the sun and where music is assourdit that the small hours.
Baracoa
Some appoint this village situated on the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful island.
This view is certainly influenced by the road that leads to it.
The two routes which are there for Guantánamo must cross mountains high and accidentées landscape and crossing an almost without expressions of human activity.
Has included the Unesco east of Cuba, thanks to its countryside intact, on the list of world heritage.
It produces the best chocolate, to church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, she has seen the light of day about one hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and since the hill, where is the former and current chateau-fort hotel El Castillo, we see many mountains table, which is the most famous El Yunque.
On the subject of coffee, of rum, cigars, mass of mountainous Sierra Maestra, the Bay of sows and of the island Isla de Pinos, Tropicana saloon, the sanctity of the holy patrone Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, of African religions practised by the descendants of the old slaves, about all this we could fulfil a number of pages.
Only, as you said, it is better to see again.

According to the Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should sketch a specific plan for the years to come.
The mission in Afghanistan do as it should, have agreed at Edinburgh in Scotland the representatives of those countries which have troops in the southern part of the country.
Alongside the growing opposition on the part of the Taliban movement, the eight Member States involved are also today of future plans and coordination allies.
While the United States have called this week by means of the Defence Minister Robert Gates NATO troops to more activity, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan Government and the intensification of development aid.
'The developments in Afghanistan is understandable, but the military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to enable the people themselves to start a new development of the economy and security ', has said on the BBC the Defence Minister britanique Several Browne.
Ninety per%
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to the American army, the more intense the past five years.
The number of violent actions has risen by 27% compared to last year, up to 60% in the province Helmand, located in the south of the country.
The countries of NATO have approximately 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, which nearly a quarter in the south.
According to the United States, the allies have achieved their absolute limit and in the organization and the equipment of troops.
Specifically, they ask other helicopters, soldiers and experts to the entrainement Afghan troops.
'We must look seriously on the concrete objectives for the period ahead, as well as on ways how to achieve them', said Gates.
The Secretary-General of NATO Jaap of Hoop held today similar comments.
'I am not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have almost 90% of the soldiers and equipment which we need, and this is not sufficiently ', said de Hoop Reuters news agency at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo who duraient three days.
That is passive
In recent months also prevails between the countries involved conflicts over the question whether all the allies are indeed Afghanistan everything possible.
For example Germany has been criticised for its passivity.
'The Germans have in Afghanistan a relatively large representation.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the requirements of battle which they are subjects are therefore not as rigorous than those in the south and east of the country in which we operate ', said Gates.
The tabloid britanique Sun has described this week the German soldiers of lazy.
'The Afghan loafers discovered that the Germans are playing, whereas ours are fighting', wrote Sun in a document complemented by photographs of German soldiers playing the tenis to table.
The German newspaper Bildt has risen to counterattack by issuing the photograph britanique force during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.

The government had planned to follow this year 159,2 billion kronor.
Thanks to a development of the economies of the budget of the State better than expected, the Ministry has reduced the sum to 152,8 billion kronor.

Throughout last year, the State has more of 1988 111 billion kronor.
"At the moment it seems that, thanks to a deficit of less important scheduled for next year, we could go beyond the borders of one billion kronor only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between EUR 900 billion and EUR one billion kronor ', said the of Finance David Marek analyst too for the server iHNed.cz.
The forecast of Finance of Next analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: "You could exceed the billion in the course of the year 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that we do not yet.
If it appears that the situation on the polique stage changed, that the policies were prepared to save more, the date could be postponed until 2010.
But I do not expect this change, 'he said.
Increasing the debts
The debt of the State is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is mainly caused by the cumulation of budget deficits in the state.

'The total debt has increased interannuellement from the first to the third quartal by 13%, which is, given the current healthy state of the economy, an embarrassingly large figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated above all by the titles - when it reached 20%.
It is wrong that the debt is growing, but on the other hand this indicates that there will be subject to negotiate when the reform of pensions', has commented on the data Pikora.
Better than expected
It follows the strategy of funding and management of the debt of the State for the year 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159,2 billion this year.
Now, at the beginning of September, thanks to a development of the economies of the budget of the State better than expected, the Ministry has reduced the sum to 152,8 billion kronor.
The sum is essentially constituted by the deficit of the budget of the State in which will obviously ateindre 76 billion this year, instead of 91,3 billion kronor initially planned.
Secondly, it is a question of maximum sources for the Agency to Czech consolidation, namely 13,3 billion kronor, a reserve of EUR 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of securities for income of State for 43 billion kronor and redemptions of loans from the European Investment Bank being EUR 1.8 billion kronor.
It likened today before a court in Khartoum to have appointed a toy bears in
The British teaching judged in Sudan to insult to Islam has been condemned on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, has indicated his lawyer.
The British was accused of having left of pupils of 6 to 7 years give the name of Mohammed to all in a toy while any representation of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
It was punishable a sentence of lashes.
This British teacher of 54 years according to the Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at home and convicted damage to Islam and of sedition, pursuant to Rule 125 of the penal code of Sudan, following a number of complaints from parents of pupils auprés of the Ministry of Education of Sudan.
The story was in fact in September when this request to its teaching pupils, between 6 / 7 years, to choose a name for the toy bears in the class.
‘ eight names out of the mouths of children, Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed ’, says the director of school Robert Boulos.
Finally, following a vote in the class, 20 children on 23 have chooses Mohamed as surname preferred.
Mohamed is, of course, the name of the prophet Muslim, but above all a surname very together in Sudan.
Children have then achieved a book the class with the photograph of the bear followed the myth ‘ My surname is Mohamed '.
The bear lui-meme was no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of the Members Gillian Gibbons Muslims, a teacher in the same school in Sudan, said that he knew well and that it should never done anything which might be offensive against a religious faith, ‘ I regret right that it has asked the children to vote for a name ', it is according to him that an innocent' mistake '.
View shared by many pupils of the teacher who the describe as' very thoughtful towards its pupils' and 'who never speaks of religion in class ’.
Let us remember that the surname Mohamed is also the second surname as given in Britain, it is written in English of 14 different ways.
This surname often chooses by the Muslim families is one way to honour the Prophet (often gave the first child of a family).
But what are the rules on the use of this first name?
Can you, for example, give a plaything?
It is of course a matter of interpretation.
They are not managed on Wednesday at an agreement on the future status of the province, during the last sitting of talks in Vienna.
In the end, the failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians have completed on Wednesday morning in Baden, in Austria, a sixth and last sitting discussions without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
‘ It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the Statute ’, said the European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger, at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was ‘ at stake ’, its American counterpart, Mr Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to safeguard peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.

The future of the province populated to 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian Ombudsman Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will give their report to the Security Council of the United Nations, here on 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, almost Vienna, was the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika has been responsible for a new mediation by the UN, in August.

Compensation on the space station spectacular
It has taken more than seven hours of work in the area to the astronaut Scott Parazynski and its crew members of the international space Station (ISS) to carry out the spectacular reparation for a solar panel disjointed, essential for the continuation of scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that has accumulated records because of its duration, its expulsion habitable modules, the speed with which it has been dreamt up, tools cobbled together by the ‘ ’ astronauts to carry out repairs.
The problem became Tuesday while the astronaut had cleared the Discovery the shuttle module Harmony, a big piece cylindrique responsible to welcome soon the European scientific laboratories and Japan (see controlled).
This is a kind of module of appontage docked for the modules-laboratoires.
But it must be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move one module of electricity by solar panels weighing 17.5 tonnes, already on the ISS, in order to put it to post on its final position.
After having moved, the crew initiated the redeployment of solar panels of module which have a scale of 76 metres.
And this is where one signs, which are déplient as accordéons, has been damaged in almost a metre by a cable which has stuck.
The deployment has been stopped for not further damage the trap.
The astronaut, which were originally carry out a way out of control of the shuttle Discovery, then go repair another solar panel, whose system of rotation was flawed, have been forced to devote themselves to the trap damaged.
And this is Scott Parazynski that has been chosen for go caracoler at the end of the 30 metres in length of télécommandé arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out repairs.
This is one of the best ‘ spacewalker ’ (marcheur of space) of the Nasa.
Great, hard-wearing, very adroit, it has the very highly developed torse and long arm.
In 46 years, this doctor of training has therefore been asked to ‘ make ’ the ‘ injured solar panel '.
Having precisely inspected the damage, it has sectionné cable at fault and has established the kinds of ‘ attelles' on the area damaged.
It was helped by a second ‘ spacewalker 'remained almost a half-way house and, internally, by other which Peggy Whitson astronaut, the commandante of the crew.
The tool that he has used, a watch hockey minicanne wrapped up of isolating to avoid the electrocution on the solar panels producing several hundred volts, has been designed and ‘ cobbled together ’ by the on-board astronauts from the station.
Once the operation is over, Scott Parazynski waited until the trap is entirely made before making an inventory of its tools and regain the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the home astronauts for half a day of détente before today, only seven astronaut can regain the Discovery shuttle Earth for a return on Wednesday.
The title EADS punished in a stock market
The EADS action is in sharp fall in the stock exchange of Paris, after the group of aerospace and defence has announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros at present on the Paris stock exchange.
The group was obliged to revise its forecast of operational result for 2007 following the delays caused by the slow progress of the development of the A400M motor of, which determines the inaugural flight of the plane.

The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense, on Sunday at the end of the ballot box: the Russians will opt en masse for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a campaign very frozen.
Has three days of the legislative elections, the Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed today the voters a television message on the public broadcasters, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as the top of Russia united, the party pro-Kremlin which the victory is overwhelming announcement.
Yesterday, the President has nothing now revealed in receiving the ambassadors foreigners, preferring to deliver a new attack against the West accused of interference – his favourite subject during the campaign.
‘ We know the price of true democracy and we want fair elections, the more transparent and open, elections smooth ', he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
It condemns a campaign marred of pressure.
The Communist leader Guennadi Zuganov said that there has never been any ‘ dirty elections as well, even at the time of Boris Yeltsin.
After the repression of demonstrations of last weekend, the world ex-champion Garry Kasparov failures, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains prohibited to visit according to his lawyer.
‘ The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus'
Behind these suspense legislation without lurk two issues much more open:
- who is to follow Putin to the presidency?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elu in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot consecutive a third presidential term.
There is no successor will emerge.
– What role will Putin after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful party Russia united chose the government and the President?
Nevertheless, the legislation and the presidency, the outgoing power will prevail.
This is a tradition.
‘ The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their own destiny ’, considers the sociologist Lev Goudkov, Director of the independent centre Levada.
The historian Kopossov Nikolaï, of the University of State of St Petersburg, goes back further: civil society has been delayed in that country christianisé five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the training individualism.
After liberal reforms of the 1990s, ‘ Putin has rediscovered the model of a paternalistic State, fully accepted by the population, especially as this new paternalism has not been followed by terror, but by a certain amount of flexibility economic ’, considers Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians' renounce voluntarily personal responsibility 'which they had briefly shown after the break-up of the USSR.
‘ A what good reflect? '
The phenomenon affects all social classes, including the business world.
And the administrative elite wants to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (on 85 Heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of Russia united.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general prefer to stability.
In the name of what the Russians do not vote for the extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, Professor of 54 years: 'A what good thinking?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why the change? '
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, archives Nazi from Bad Arolsen, who retracent the destiny of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are free access.
The 47 million archived documents, stored on 27 linear km to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were previously consulted in a 'humanitarian' objective, namely individually named products, on request an old victim or its rightholders.
The eleven Member States for their management about Germany, France, Israel and the Etats-Unis- agreed in May 2006 for researchers and open them up to the historians.
The process of ratification of the agreement by all the States being completed, openness is possible since yesterday.
In sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable us to conduct research 'in particular on the movement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of workers forced', explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several Member States, including Germany, were opposed to the opening up to the public of these roll-call documents, because of the sensitivity of certain information.
As the alleged homosexuality or the mentally ill of certain victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war in a practical goal: restoring civilians deported or subject to compulsory work and, possibly, provide proof of their imprisonment, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Yet today to Bad Arolsen, over 300 permanent employees are tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
‘ There is nothing again to expect these documents', stated in 2006 Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on anti-Semitism to the Technische Universität of Berlin.

Will there be an end of year racing on the stock exchange? experts divided by the crisis of sub-primes.
At least five weeks of the closure of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping the arrival of racing traditional for the end of the year.
However, this year the experts are not so certain that this will happen.
Banif believes that 'the statistical point of view the December on the stock exchange is generally a positive attitude.
However, we must not only make forecasts based on statistics, since that given the current context, uncertainties ambush on the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not supporters for the stock exchange takes impetus in the remaining weeks of the year, these experts claim that 'the stock market feeds thanks to the existence of liquidity, prepared to invest in view of the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect of brain towards the values of quality both in the long periods in the short'.
To this end, they believe that the stock market will have a rather latéral behaviour, not free of volatilités' particularly because people do not know what the impact of the probable reduction rates of the EDF, given the high level of crude and the danger of the stimulation of inflationary pressures'
Javier Barrio, responsible sales of BPI in Spain, agree on the fact that this is not the right moment to say that there will be a racing.
'This is not the best thing', ensures the expert.
The Ibex, the Spanish share index, has lost nearly 4% since 8 November when an index has completed to 15.945,7 points.
Not all the experts have this vision if negative.
Juan Solana, of Intermoney analyst, believes that the Ibex 35 might conclude the year to 10 000 points with the reorganisation of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension schemes which occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert qualifications that things will be rather different this year since it believes that the racing will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge the celebration of the Constitution (on 6 December).
We do not consider the analyst volatility will affect the tendency of the market.
For its part, Federico Olucha, of analyst Inversis Banco, assesses that we are near the technical level and that is why we could hold an index of the event which could be created on the basis of the information which come to the European Union as regards the consequences of the crisis on the market of appropriations'.
Analyst the hope that they will be positive.
The analysts are agreed to choose the values which are those responsible for conducting the Ibex towards new cottes upper limits.
Solana, Intermoney, states that 'this year the great values are of return for him ".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and a few manufacturers' because when the switch-over date, the electricity sector will be very expensive '.
While, Federico Olucha, Inversis Banco ensures that the increases will be of the bank and the industrial sector.
The constructrices racing can also benefit from this, in cases where they are put.
'for several months ACP recovering positions and we hope that the other constructrices as Ferrovial and FCC suiveront the same way', explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the sales of Christmas season.
On the other hand, the expert who believes that the technology companies will also very well, although in this case there is not a great deal of representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the past seven years, only two occasions during the month of December was a month baissier.
The genuine racing by the end of the year took place in 2003, the year in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the construction of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 has recovered 28,17%, the month of dicembre has seen an increase of 6,68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth year running of the gains (at the moment the Ibex has increased by 8,36% since January) and if it manages to computer racing on the end of the year.

Station Telecinco dual for the first time the stock market value of his opponent Antena 3
We have achieved.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, an adviser station Telecinco delegate, yesterday expressed its satisfaction with the closure of the stock market, when he stated that he leads chain has doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Just one aspect ternissait his joy: 'what pains me, this is not the fact that we have more increased but that we have less fallen, affirmait-il.
However, emphasis has been placed on the fact that on a low market, would we have less fallen.
Station Telecinco finished yesterday the day with a spread of 2.54%.
This gain stabilises its loss to 15,66% for a year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13%) reached the 4.488,88 million, according to the data of Bloomberg.
His opponent Antena 3, which gave yesterday 1,52% and a reduction of that accumulates 40.5% since January, is half, 2.193,46 million.

According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is of is the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The fact on represents what we are able to do, on the same market, at what cost and how we rentabilisons in terms of audience.
Station Telecinco announced last week that it intends to become this year the first television channel to outdo the 1000 million gross advertising income, as has ensured Giuseppe Tringali, Councillor delegated to station Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary which administers the advertising of the group.

Vasile ensures that, although it is soon to take a decision, this balance could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
'We have the official compromise given for minimal 50%, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to welcome our shareholders, to those to whom we have already given of securities with the 33% of Endemol.
According to the analysts, the market is at the moment signs of exhaustion.
Lehman Brothers has recently reduced its estimates of benefits to station Telecinco to 4% in 2008 and 2009, to 7%.
This is due, expliquent-ils, reducing the expected growth of income from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same company has diminished the anticipation of the gains of Antenne 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

The Secretary of the organisation of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco and Bono himself the announced during a press conference after the meeting which took place at midday on federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer made to the former Minister because 'it is important to count on the best' in political life and Bono 'is among the best'.
Furthermore, it pointed out that 'yes it seems that' the politician of La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist Group who will chair the Congress if the Socialists will win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, which it has published on 15 November its decision not to stand for prochainess general elections and to abandon his political career to devote itself to the fight against climate change in the context at university level.
The former Minister has recognised that the President of the government has not stopped to insist that it be returned to the forefront policy since he has abandoned two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, even if the citizens know who will be the Vice-President Economic if the Spanish Socialist party won the elections, his party has wanted to announce that chair at the Congress, in a note of transparency.
If it reached the post, Bono hope transform the House in 'a house of respect and not insult or cry "and that" it will increasingly resemble the citizens'.

Similarly, it took the words of praise for its current President, Manuel Marín and 'its know do "and it did not want to act as if it had already his post for not fall, as he said, in what its opponents might regard as' a domination '.
A climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change makes a persecution without mercy both the sceptics its predictions that those which gives priority to other social and political battles, it must demonstrate consistency of railways.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement that is chairman of the government as Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamic terrorism and who are even proposing sign a 'new contract for the planet'.
This approach requires it to explain why action or inaction, its government have contributed decisively to what Spain is at the head of the European Union in the non-éxecution the Kyoto protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-éxecution, in which sectors has thereby produced and why his government, that of the contract with the planet, did not avoided.
Furthermore, it should be clear to the Spanish what measures it will take to slow down climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of the citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we have to do, what this trigger economic consequences.
That is to say, which is sacrifiera and who is to pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanations.
It is precisely because it comes to sacrifice itself and pay.
The measures against climate change, the actual measures, are unpopular.
Coûteuses, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until the hundredth of petrol suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him electoralmente if dangerous Zapatero has hastened to deny it.
That is to say that it comes to save the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With some of the things which have the impact, of the committees, committees, of the protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, the gentleman so useful in the campaigns which do not speak, which does not condemn and which does not require, embellit the meetings and inspires the warmth.
Provided that it is limited only to be a purely a virtual party and which does not pretend to what we say in bicycle or we rafraîchissions with the range.

What I assurance acceptable?
The motor insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, involves a large expenditure which will depend on various factors such as age, sex, seniority of driving licences, the marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use that we in fact, among others.
Have a car that is the main issue.
Are there, escoger el seguro of automóvil adecuado es incluso más difícil that elegir el modelo of vehículo.
And that is that, choose the car insurance, is even more difficult than to choose the model of the vehicle.
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is based on insurance contracts, which lays down that the company receives the value of the premium paid and, in return, it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the cost of insurance, which is establishing itself taking account of various factors such as age, sex, seniority of driving licences, the marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or usageque we in fact, among others.
Insurance companies establish their prices on the basis of statistics, so that more the probability of an accident is high, more popular to pay is high.
It is for this reason that the people over 25 years and women have to pay premiums lower, since the statistics show that these persones have a lower rate of accidents in their care.
In the same way, using Censuses, companies have concluded that the married people tend to have fewer accidents that single drivers.
The use that is made of the vehicle affect the frequency, and therefore on the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the likelihood.
They are many variables that insurers take into account in setting the price of the premium.
It is for this reason that the driver must study the situation to choose the motor insurance which can adapt better to its profile.
We shall, here the most significant variables at the time to choose one or other type of insurance, for that, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insurer, gives a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 must face up to various drawbacks in delivering a contract with an insurance at an accessible price, as may be the limited experience in the conduct and seniority of driving licences.
Although the ideal to be guaranteed an assurance to any risk, other options are cheaper exist.
The most far-sighted drivers can opt for an insurance any risk with frankness, so that they get insurance requirements to any risk but at a price that is more accessible.
This form of convention means that the user pays a part of the amount of the disaster.
'The part of the amount of the sinister that pays the customer will be established on the basis of the value of the premium, which will be higher more the amount will be weak ", specifies Luis Noguera, the responsible in Spain of First Europa, insurance Ombudsman online.
Another option is the third assurance enlarged, so that the client ensures protection to face up to the damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on its own car.
Furthermore, it would be covered against the flight, fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A advice.
If you are a minor essaies 25 years to be careful and to prevent accidents, as far as possible, since it has implications for subsidising, which can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A is a reduction of the basic tariff that has the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase of the basic tariff.
'The subsidies and sanctions will depend on the company and profit from it.
If the company has been a good year it can afford to increase the subsidies', clarifies Noguera.
Besides the 25 years it becomes easier for drivers in delivering a contract with insurance, since the rate of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose an insurance any risk with frankness.
'Normalement young people cannot take advantage of the experience gained after an accident in advance, ensures the Director of the European company in Spain and add that most accidents occur during the second year of conduct, once past the fear of the' new '.
However, if the customer is married but has not yet children it is better that it is negotiating an insurance to any risk, momento that its economic situation allows us to do so.
Marriages with children are regarded by the insurers as those with the lowest rate of accidents, because the increases will be weak.
In this case the best assurance would be an assurance to any risk with frankness (which can be EUR 300), or an enlarged third assurance from the third year of the vehicle life when the policyholder has a high level of bonification.
They have a conduct more relaxed and they have the greatest purchasing power to afford the luxury of a greater proportion of exemptions', judge Luis Noguera.
Insurance for pensioners to any risk with frankness is better (as it to EUR 150), or a third of enlarged asurance when the insurer has a high level of bonification.
It must be said that the motor insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expenditure, that is why it is essential to investigate properly the assurance that we need the most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will seek to win a point to Milan to reach the final huitièmes of

A defeat of the team of Gordon Strachan could be sufficient to classify if the Donetsk Shakhtar does not earn, but it will not computer only on this since with nine points the Games Ukrainian lies, who have lost the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who have won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the in Milan will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have every hope to classify for the final huitièmes of for the second time in the Champions League, having been fought in the latest edition by an aim of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).

‘ The fluctuations of the costs of gases are undoubtedly linked to our discussions about taxes of transit (towards Western Europe) via Ukraine ’
The last great altercation between Moscow and Kiev has caused in January 2006, the adjournment of Gazprom supply to Ukraine.
This has led to the fall of exports to Western Europe, increasing consequently prices.
The Russian gas is a quarter of supplies of the European Union.
Russia has the largest stocks of gas, even though the majority of them are still under developed.
Consequently, Gazprom complements its own with gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health must monitor its employees' foreigners'.
The Ministry of Health in Scotland must improve the controls to be carried out on its non-Community workers to check whether they have previous criminal, said the monitoring committee.
The warning of the Réviseur General, Robert Black, took place after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the attack in Glasgow airport of June.
Mr Black has moreover, expressed its concern about the fact that the Ministry of Health in Scotland has no precise information on the number of people it employs overseas.
His report has just highlighted other decisive controls, correctly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The general auditor made controls on the non-Community staff following the attack in Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years, Dr of origin of Iraq at the service of the Royal Alexandra - of Paisley Hospital, was arrested at the airport having foncé with its jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
It was a party of the three doctors who have been filmed the Old Bailey in October, because suspected of being involved in various attempts to explosion of cars in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out checks in fields employment on the staff overseas, to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experience and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Ministry of Health using the Scottish Disclosure Ecossaise for monitoring previous criminal, the agency has no right to have such information outside Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the report of the general auditor now declared that the committees are obliged to debate with the Bureau of control previous criminal, thus enabling, employers to undertake checks on various countries.
‘ although we discovered that some information regarding the staff have been verified, this is done at every time. 'announces the report.
Mr Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health pre-in controls carried out most of the jobs that it would do itself, but it has also added: 'our report highlights the areas where the system can be improved, in order to ensure that adequate information on some members of staff overseas to be available to the health services.
Mr Peter Terry, chairman of BMA Scotland has stated that it is highly unlikely that the pre-in controls employment can identify employees likely to make future terrorist acts.
He says' the report suggests that controls fields employment currently made, work well in the Scottish health system and it is not certain that these warnings can offer any added value '.
The Scottish health authorities have stated employ 1161 people overseas, responsible for the majority of doctors and nurses.
But the general auditor has pointed out that these figures must certainly be adjusted upwards, partly because of the problems relating to the identification of staff with open-ended contracts, which would be able to choose whether or not to remain in our countries.
The survey showed that the current procedures of controls of the health authorities to and Ayrshire Arran, Grampian, Greater and Clyde Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These controls are carried out on passport, work permit and qualifications.
The Scottish Government currently revising its policy and its system of controls fields employment for the staff in addition to ocean of the health service.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: 'I was keen to make this work following the terrorist attack in Glasgow airport.'
It added that the Scottish Government ally health committees would consider carefully the warnings set out in the report which should be published next month, and commit themselves to ensure better implementation of controls fields employment updated recently, and that apply to all workers, including those overseas.

The television of the largest global exporteur of oil, said that the cells of smugglers of missiles.

A cell composed of eight militants, led by a foreign resident planifiait an attack on a site oil tanker in the eastern Province, told the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia has quickly been a group of military 35 to protect sites, following an attack Al Qaeda washed up to 2006, against the largest oil site to Abqaiq.
The newspaper quoting a statement from the Minister of the Interior, said that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a ‘ launching of missiles expert 'which has crept into the country.

The climate of Venus may reveal the future of the planet.
The scientists have said that Venus yesterday was certainly a pleasant to live.
The data from the European ship in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly two times smaller than the Earth, contrary to what we thought in the past.
Is the planet Venus most around the earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar nature, although closer to the Sun Venus.
Scientists now believe that there billions of years, could have been Venus conditions similar to those of the Earth, and could even have been inhabitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to the carbon dioxide, air erosion dûe to solar radiation allied rotation at a slower Venus has led to a different kind of development.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and storms flash of and has an area of temperature hot enough to melt lead.
The findings of Venus Express, the spot checks of the European Space Agency, which has studied the planet for one year, offers a sad vision of the future potential of the Earth due to the catastrophic change the climate.
Professor the Department of physical Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the mission of Venus Express, said: ‘ we are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of the Earth, although the planets in they even are quite similar.
‘ Our new data enable us to establish a scenario in which there are billions of years would have been originally Venus identical to the earth, may be even with a habitable. '

Yet open to
Mitt Romney said not to be up as candidate for the Presidency, in reply to the questions of a slip of snow.
Despite this, the candidates Republicans in the Presidency have finally agreed to participate in this debate you Tube, during which many ordinary voters who have seen their questions, the subject to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening 28 November, any of the questions has not been as ridiculous that the one debate after another You Tube, when a slip of snow asked the democrats in their position with regard to global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have very much reflected the conditions of the republican party, candidate for the next elections.
We are not clear on what criteria, producers of CNN, who has sponsorisé the debate, have chosen the Tube result of you to show the candidate countries candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest addressing just one subject, has concentrated on immigration.
The issue is one of the subjects the strong for the Republicans.
CNN has asked a number of telephone when they would understand things pleasant: the governed rose approval increases when the candidates spoke out of blatant manner.
The exchange the harder and the longer the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, National Front leader and Mr Romney which is at the top of the list of important elections of the Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani has tried to highlight the fact that it was compliant about illegal immigration during his mandate of Mayor of New York.
It has attacked Mr Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, to employ illegal immigrants home.
The two combatants have become particularly severe when they were asked whether they would be prepared to promote a ‘ amnésia '(providing a regular illegal status and the possibility of becoming citizen).
Of the candidates minors as Duncan Hunter, Californian Canseco, Tom Tancredo, one of Colorado Canseco, have managed to deepen it.
None of them has the chance of being elected, but both remain in the race, may be due to the fact that they have begun to combat immigration before and more incisive than others.
In general, the candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: the borders more rigid, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This, combined with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or many other fears towards the outside world, to promote the Republicans to forget, or to minimise the divisions between the libertarian and Conservatives Catholics.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other issues have been raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why it had previously supported the campaign for the control of arms.
John McCain and Mr Romney have debated whether put water in the nose should be considered a torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in its entirety, the content of the Bible.
This has led to Mr Giuliani dare to say that the Bible is his book preferred, even if it is not about to believe in the history of Jonas and whales.
Another speaker has asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We do not expect to see Mike Huckabee - in pole position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to its Christian conservatism - state that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, it has put to laugh and said that Jesus is too smart to stand for election.
The human race insolitement remains open to all.
The resurgence of Mr Huckabee in Iowa coincides with the Republic of recent research carried out by the libertarian Ron Paul, and the sifflements during the debate on Wednesday.
These two there are émergés of nothingness, thanks to the fact that the two protected of the party are unable to agree to decide who is the candidate had traditionalist more and more.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unifia the party in good time and cogently thanks to a message of success on the American greatness bringing the leaders.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Of the pain gags
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole in which sink; although it démissionnait, the situation will not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, it is not particularly deals.
No decorations sold or hotel bills Paris of politicians, not of finger of marital extra sucé.
But that is only a revelation is that a rich man of case would have obscured for four years, under false names, its contributions to the current Travailliste Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: another battle which Gordon Brown is might well past.
There are two months ago, Prime Minister reconsidered its project of election, insulting the British intelligence stupidly declaring that the opinion polls have not influenced its decision, and that he hoped to the contrary, offer a compact government and effective.
On the contrary, this Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr Brown has transformed of Stalin to Mr Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on the brink of fall, has shown a loophole directives and a poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
The inadequate proposals in favour of change of the tax code have caused a coalition of the industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million of personal data on the part of the authorities of taxes, showed incredible administrative cock-up.
A general trio of retirement age have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the military expenditure cuts: they have declared that be Defence Minister is for them, part-time jobs.
At present the suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Mr Watt, the Secretary-General of gags (and its former head of vigilance) have done that they have had to resign.
All of this means that Mr Brown is inevitably leads to the door.
However governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not like the politicians, and do not have confidence in them, but are in general their doubts to hand in that a new government is in power.
It seems clear that a Prime Minister can improve things, nor even govern for a long time, then we risk the suspension: the public administration is not working; the cabinets of Ministers are stock; the research of the bad press stories; and the government is on the defensive and without any more objective.
In a sense, the position of Mr Brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, it cannot claim to be a beginning.
Although it would like to repudiate Tony Blair, it has just been its higher lieutenant.
The problems relating to the Northern Rock and data taxes for example, are linked to decisions by Mr Brown taken when it was Chancellor of the UK Treasury.
And even if it is not directly involved in the misfortunes of Blair, that the long investigation into the funds of the party 'money to the members of the House of Lords ’, the voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation that has to Mr Brown is not so tragic that it has the air.
The blunders monstrous are not such as the members of the party of the Tories believe.
As in Mr Bean, there is no victim or scam.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to implement the Stalinist tendencies of Mr Brown of always in favour of a reliable government and somewhat brutal.
The new scandal on donations policies is a good example.
Mr Abrahams, a very particular character, which compares its donations to charity, said that there was no public recognition of its charity.
It can have a different opinion, but it is not for Parliament to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of big subventionneurs politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: the public has a right to know which contributes to the success of those who motive that the country.
Mr Watt, who said to be aware of the programmes of Mr Abrahams, without knowing what it was illegal, must consequently be questioned, as Jon Mendlesohn, the collection of subsidies which had spoken of dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr Brown is not involved: there is no evidence to suggest that it has been aware of these steps, even if the majority of payments made have been made following his arrival in government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has made half.
It was quickly condemned the legislative loophole in his party, but it has not drawn attention to the fact that the power of decision is based on one thing is that it well, make use of a committee of inquiry on this subject, consisting of a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been flouted, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent President for the independent committee of the Standards of public life, without leader for six months, and prepare a good reform on the funding of political parties.
That would force the as Labour MEPs, in a time of weakness, to cooperate with the Tory vanities, which could persuade him to renounce its financial report particular with confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter that Mr Brown.
But it should face some facts supporters.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to recover the voters, and the only way to obtain a victory is to demonstrate a watertight integrity and solid skills.
Fraud cards.
The crisis of the American market contaminerait-elle mortgages of credit cards?
When there are of blood in water, it is reasonable to see of fins artificially induced, tourbillonner around.
Now that the property of the American market is going through a critical phase, the predators target the American market of credit cards.
The analysts from Goldman Sachs think that the losses relating to credit cards could achieve $99 billion if the infection of mortgages extends to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in rates of costs and insolvency, which measure the shares of the assessment not recoverable or who are more than 30 days after.
HSBC announced last month he has taken $1.4 billion in its funds to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of the bearers.
It is still too early to panic.
The costs and the insolvabilités are still moderates.
According to Moody, a fiscal agency, the rate of the insolvency of 3,89% of troixième quarter is less than almost a point in relation to its historical average.
The deterioration of the rates is partly be ascribed to the technical factors.
A change of laws in 2005 in the United States, on the personal bankruptcy has caused a fall abrupt of archives of bankruptcy, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards, and the number of archives (and therefore of insolvency rate) could increase even if the conditions for loans were to deteriorate.
The industry announcement in addition rates fixed payment, which highlight the sum of monthly debt that consumers must resolve.
And confidence in the sureté of capital of credit cards is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of finance structured.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a society of research, has predicted that the volume of emission for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links between the crisis of infection mortgages and the market of credit cards certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debts now that the home loans have disappeared.
But the issuers of cards are more attention to the flow of species rather than the value of our heritage, and therefore the fall in the price of property has not necessarily brought about a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They might even bring benefits for issuers of securities of credit.
The premiums for consumers in the payment of mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of borrowing; consequently, the indebtedness by credit card would become a priority to repay the amounts up everything.
Issuers of cards are able to respond much more rapidly than mortgage the and with more flexibility in such conditions of crisis, because they can change interest rates or undermine the limits of rédit.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of having an early resumption of actions.
‘ We will not we wake up one morning and reassess all loans. 'said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster of the market of credit cards is unlikely, there is a strong risk of having a consistent reduction.
If the lower prices of property and a reduction in the credit market America lead towards the recession, industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Please listen carefully to the fins dorsales.
The British bankers are responsible for the case of Enron.
The three British bankers who should go express their roles in relation to fraud by the previous financial director of Enron, Mr Andrew Fastow, have changed their declaration, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were first declared innocent of the seven accusations for alleged fraud collusoire in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial fraud in order to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They should come to the court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by the American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they are all found guilty of committing a fraud.
The three ex frameworks for Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Group PLC of the Bank Royale of Scotland, have become famous everywhere in Britain because of extradition procedures which have lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is still a matter for this inquiry launched following the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The accusations that were imposed in 2002, have made it clear to Fastow that it was the subject of the investigation of the government in the collapse of Enron.
The accusations against the bankers, so-called 'three of Natwest' they have come to Houston, in 2000, to organise a scenario with Fastow fraudulent and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich has invested in a subsidiary of a partner of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the orchestrator many fraudulent scenarios, which has helped àtruquer the procedures of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank considered its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the British three are already aware of its value.
A society controlled by Kopper has bought the interests of the bank of the subsidiary to £1 million.
Bankers have paid $250 000 to Kopper as interest in this society.
According to the accused, would Fastow falsely announced to Enron that society of energy was having to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its actions in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went into the pockets of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, bankers would have achieved $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would have won $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for its active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months after.
Endures Fastow imprisonment of six years in prison in a federal Louisiana.
Kopper was imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The British three have been released following the payment of a deposit of $1million each, which oblige them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, before seventh largest national company, in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting trucages could no longer hide its billion of debt or even propose its phoney speculation as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion loss of market value and over $2 billion loss for the pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the former President general Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year, for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to over 24 years in prison.
The accusations against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have failed because of his death due to a heart attack last year.

Everyone hope that the Federal Reserve will diminish the rates associated with the enthusiasm of the world stock exchange.
The actions are explosive devices of both side of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market had hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to ease the conditions of credit, further reducing interest rates promoted by the statements apaisantes of vice chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank.
The stock markets collapsing in London, New York and everywhere in Europe after that Donald Kohn, No 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, has declared that those who make decisions, must be ‘ flexible and pragmatic 'in their actions in the financial markets woven.
In a clear effort to reassure the markets irritated seen these new tensions linked to credit, Mr Kohn said that the recent fallout has partly ‘ reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
If this harsh fallout persists, it would increase the likelihood of a further rigidity of the financial conditions for the owners and businesses, a-t- it said.
These comments are investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital markets in the US, and that further reductions of interest rates might stabilise the conditions of credit.
These remarks have also enabled us to pacify Wall Street with new even worse on the American economy, such as the biggest loss of property sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of the financial turmoil was accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, investment bank, announcing that it licenciera 650 people, that is to say, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the losses to the losers of dûes bets home loans.
Only 20 posts are foreseen in London where the bank employs 1 500 people.
In New York, the average industrial wage the Dow Jones index rose by 331 points, either 2,55% to 13.289,40 while an index the greatest, S & P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index 100 took 165,5 points is 2.7% to 6306,2 adding more than GBP 39 of the value of the British companies.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6% and the French CAC40 has taken 2.3%.
Previously, the revival of the difficulties of credit in the markets has been highlighted as a result of the strong demand an auction of funds monthly sorting produced by the European Central Bank, which has cut these loans to European commercial banks in the high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressures on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and subsequent injection of funds in the financial markets, causing tension in London of credit, because the rates of loans monthly sorting ‘ Libor 'British banks, have done their utmost growth since September last year, following a strong 6,59% increase for the 12 November.
England faces an appeal to the judgment in relation to the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
That will be the batteur No 6 in England to Kandy this week ending, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as large as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, President of the sélectionneurs who was exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to take its decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, President Director General of England, is beginning to fulfil application forms for becoming a national sélectionneur, at least part time.
Who will not be able to win the dossard No 6 will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport is also necessary.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to arrive at the top of his profession while another will never happen in addition to the lower level, sometimes through lack of opportunity more than by lack of skill.
There is not just to cricket that the selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment is subjective.
Is the right moment to emerge Bopara?
Is it right to Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, who choose between John Edwards Banerjee ’ or ‘ tubby?; both, new framework with good qualifications, professionals, should be promoted, but there is room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketeur unless it is given at least a chance?
The figures are important in the decisions, but also the opportunities.
Has the interior of a team, a cricketeur must catch the eye of the captain, at the same time it must take the door and a batteur must be fortunate to reach the cricketeur for a day.
But catch the eye of sélecteurs is much more complicated.
Many have done better the last season, for example, James Anderson which seemed certain to play the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison claimed to healthy and continued to entrainer to serve.
Anderson took 32 doors first class on 33 rounds to gain a place.
Chris Tremlett has taken that 29 to the same average, but both of them have already experienced their time of glory in the greatest level and offer hope.
If it will be Shah or Bopara which will play the stage Asgiriya, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build the career of a man, but it makes little difference.
There are four years, Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and has been successful in the first, with five doors and 40 rounds useful, but it was Paul Collingwood, fighting also to emerge, who has managed to become the cricketeur crucially important Test and that, despite the fact that its dual cent marked against Australia in Australia can still be under estimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, following a further discussion after today's session Asgiriya stage, will certainly their conservative instincts and favour the greatest experience of Shah against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
The two have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable innings beginning at the Test of 88 in Mumbai, 32 hundred first class against six for Bopara, who 22ans is seven years younger and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah only ten rounds in its two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test Lord, the city of the Middlesex player, and that the immediate rejection by the sélectionneurs when Vaughan again in form, réclama place for the next game, seems to have been afflicted moose if its obvious in Mumbai.
Unlike him, the player of Essex is full of joy to live.
Nothing is afraid in an area of cricket and it has exaggerated when it has recently scuppered 4x4 on a during a presentation of Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
It has postponed that minor injuries, has been shocked, even if the first thing that he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor on) and call Alastair Cook, his équipier who witnessed scenes of further, to ask him if he had known that ‘? '
Bopara is by far the best batteur, its rate filante allows him to make services will, and that it breaks with confidence and professionnalité.
To choose the right is one thing, choose the right moment is another.
Can be the true art of the selection?
I would be conducive to give its chance to Bopara, which does not mean that Shah does not apply if, as the leaves of tea suggest, it is he who will play this week ending.
Buses bring people at work, and to fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria has happened to Baghdad yesterday, shedding the exiles without money or without a visa reviews, or others who hope that the city has reached normality.
Some have returned to fight against the activists who have far from home.
Has the bus station Mansour, even before the arrival of Damascus 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses of official government, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who have returned by their means.
‘ I have decided to visit Syria after they have killed many doctors to Baghdas' Sabah al-Qubaisi has said, a doctor Sunni.
‘ I returned today because I have seen the TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdâd and given that the city is now safer. '
'They say that the army Mahdi will more than crimes! ’, he said, referring to the militia Shia church of Moqtada al-Sadr, who has imposed on his men to grow at the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, one teacher Shia 38 years in the area of Amariyah dominated by the Sunni, returned with his two children, because it could no longer renew its Syrian visa and because the regime prevents the Iraqi to work.
Its neighbours of the Shia to Amariyah called for the report that the militia aided by the United States, has enabled us to get rid of Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and have invited to return.
One of the new arrivals of Jordan is the head of a tribe Sunni, Shia who has had to leave their homes in the north of Baghdâd due to a grenade attack after he had led people to rebel against Al Qaeda.
But it should return to combat.
‘ two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that we have put in place a militia Al Qaeda Sleikh opposed to, and that they need to me and my boys. '
‘ I therefore falls today 'said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years.
Many people say they have attracted by the growing lull in the capital, since the US troops came, and the order of training of ‘ groups of citizens involved 'well armed and working together with the US military to defend their neighbourhood.
But other say that they have been forced to return to the issue of visas and the demise of the capital of Damascus, where over 1.3 million Iraqi have fled the past.
Al-Samarrai Salaam, 51 years, father of three children, has expressed the suspicion felt by all about visas for exiled that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who would have asked the Syrian Government to limit to force people to return to their country.
More than two and a half million people have fled the country because of the sectarian squads of death.
‘ we had no problem until al-Maliki comes in Syria and urges the government not to give the Iraqi visas, forcing them to return to Iraq ‘ said the Sunni pensioner.
‘ I cannot trust in a government which supports the criminals who burned my house when I am party '.
The reduction of violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been driven out of the areas of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
It is feared that a sudden influxes of refugees does not grow again sectarian tensions and bring the fighting.
Small Saarland, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in training professionelle, and even by the presence of international orientation of its universities.
It is only in an area that a deficit hangs over the sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
'I exliqué yesterday to the 50ème time in a non-sarrois, that we are not of the French' - that is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-mockery is something, for his 50ème anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of Saarland, system which is placed fifth in the monitor of training of the Institute of German economy in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, colleges and universities cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded on Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To this day, the students have the chance to complete their studies by two or three qualifications.
Witness the high quotitée 15.6% of foreign students.
The Saarland led by also children in the country until the colleges in number than the average - many of them without a degree of Gymnasium.
'In Saarland, they benefit from vocational training systems', said Axel Plünnecke, an expert on IW training.
More than one in five young people gets its way of studies in a vocational school, and the Saarland stands at more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combination of academic and vocational training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the panel of dual training is the second best of Germany.
In spite of practical training and a growing demand, the number of diplomés engineering has however fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education sarrois forced the universities to a marketing campaign in matters of science of the engineer.
'after the first PISA studies we celebrated a large number of reforms in schools general. ", said a spokesman of the Ministry of the education.
Thus, the government has introduced in all the federal state of comparative tests.
For that children are starting earlier to learn, the last year of crêche is free of law - a model that other federal states also copy.
Only of future comparative studies will show whether the performance of pupils are improving in a sustainable way.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the quotité of pupils at risk are reduced by 29 to 20%.
Overall, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarian perform better.
And despite the sarrois, the foreign language knowledge are not measured by the PISA studies - we could otherwise gain points in this area.
Because the language of our neighbours is compulsory in the colleges – even though the sarrois are not the French.
The Chávez rule used
In Venezuela, will soon be used away other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will go back the clock half an hour in the Latin American countries.
Meantime Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela informed that, because of the new law, will be resolved at least used four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the Latin American countries gets an hourly zone which does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified its position by, amongst other things, the fact that the United States would have imposed in the world the separation of time zones in hours.
Furthermore, announced on Wednesday (Chávez local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, the fact of a case of hostages.
The left-wing nationalist announced that until the Alvaro Uribe Conservative would remain President of Colombia, to maintain relations with the head of state, nor with the Colombian Government.
'I am, already just because of my dignity', said Chávez who look forward a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil-producing country will have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would increase significantly its power in the country.
The issue now this dispute was the decision to Uribe to withdraw to Chávez the mandate for negotiations on the release of hostages with the rebels Marxists in Colombia.
Uribe would have 'craché in the face' of Venezuela with this decision, had criticised Chávez Sunday.
In Spain also Chávez is on everyone 's lips.
A new bell of mobile phone fact vigour in the country: "Por qué No te callas' (why do not tais-tu) is the sentence that already more than half a million people downloaded it on the Internet.
It has been issued by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, in the most recent Ibero-American Summit was annoyed by the constant appeals the populists of left and said to remain silent.
A reduction in wages threat Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic growth, according to a prognosis, a real moins-value of salary threatens employees from Germany this year.
Experts have mentioned all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the Foundation Hans-Böckler, employees should be expected in 2007 to a real reduction in their pay slip compared to the previous year.
'The fault lies in the low wage development, increased the Tax on the added value and the outbreaks food prices and energy', said Gustav Horn of the Institute for the macro-economic and research on the economy, for the newspaper 'Bildt'.
Burdens could also intervene in matters of assurance-chômage for an employee.
The Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück said to the 'Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung' that the planned reduction of the assurance-chômage of 3.3% in the new year is certainly correct and sensible in the current situation.
However the national agency for employment no longer has the right to be in the embarrassment to ask the Federation of loans or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
We have managed to Tuesday that the explosion in the price of food products and hydrocarbons had led the rate of inflation is at its highest level since 13 years.
In total, prices have risen by 3.0% from one year to the next.
Is the infernal twin Venus of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere hostile to life, resembles more Venus the Earth that what we believed until now: the European Space probe 'Venus Express' Estonia has discovered in the atmosphere and tourbillons of wind in the poles, similar to those which appear in winter on earth.
For almost three decades, the scientists presuppose that there are on Venus Estonia.
The European probe 'Venus Express ’ has today provided proof - it has detected electromagnetic waves to the limit of the atmosphere: the lightning on coordinating Venus to a level of around 56 kilometres in cloud cloud, Christopher Russel relates to the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine ‘ Nature ’.
According to the theory of the famous cyprine, the lightning would have revealed life on earth: the storm cloud would have stimulated the reactions in the oceans which led to the formation of amino acids, cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: 'If lives there was, it must have been a very old date of history', explains Sean Solomon 'Carnegie Institution' to Washington.
There should be no living things today to the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is approximately one hundred times more extensive as on earth, it is sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
'is perhaps the infernal twin Venus on earth, but it is still a twin', said Russel.
Why Venus, which looks so to the Earth in droves and dimensions, was hit by a development also different, is the fundamental issue of the ESA.
The departure of 'Venus Express ’ in November 2005 was an important step in research vénusienne, since there was no checks on the road to the exploration of this planet since the nineties.
In the opinion of researchers and research findings that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature 'point out not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They show that the points in common with the earth of our neighbouring planéte are more numerous than expected at first sight.
The researchers have found, in addition to the tourbillons of wind déja known to the North Pole, a maelstrom of clouds the southern side, which still has much more quickly.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents in the land hemispheres in winter, writing a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Italian Cosmica.
The second planéte of solar sytème almost the same volume that the earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 kilométres, almost as great.
The qualified planéte star of the evening or the morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it is much more slowly on itself: a day vénusien harsh 243 days of land.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures 460 degrees celsius and pressure of 92 bar, do not remember the Earth, scientists presuppose that the two planétes were formed under similar circumstances.
On the two, water has gained and has remained on earth in the form of oceans, but has lost in the area on Venus.
And while the carbon dioxide has set on earth in the form of carbonate, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends the meeting of Merkel with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler requires the end of the argument of parties on the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, it criticised the SPD because attacks against the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and after the grand coalition to close the argument about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
'We must not submit to the outside world a divided nation on this question', said Köhler on 'Handelsblatt'.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by the Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
'The human rights have a universal validity, even if I have respect for the differences between cultures' Köhler stated.
Everyone knows that Germany should retain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, as President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproaches according to which it would hold a new policy on China.
The German Federal Chancellor has not distanced himself from the policy traditionelle of One China.
'The China knows', said Köhler.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) was indirectly stated its dissatisfaction with the acceptance of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier complained particularly to the policy of devanture 'of the CDU in terms of foreign policy.
After the acceptance of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery, virulent did irritations is felt in the reports germano-chinois.
The Chinese Government has not only the German Finance Minister refused to take part Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from the Spiegel, has also frozen dialogue said of strategy of the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the two countries.
The head of the government of China Wen Jiabao now requires the Chancellor allemmande Angela Merkel of reconnaitre that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in its official duties, based Wen Jiabao the Chinese position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama would show that it tries to separate from China, Tibet and other Tibetan regiones, which also includes other provinces.
Schäuble warns against the riots as those of France.
Street battles with the police, firing, cars in fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against the riots as those of France.
Everything must be done to ensure that the social dissatisfaction in Germany does not arise in the streets by violence, demanded the German Minister of the Interior.
The barricades that burn the hooligans appeared which derive from the police with hunting gun: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Minister for the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) feared a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not also contitue at home and désamorce in violence.
We must take this seriously ', he said to the' Neue Press' study in Hanover.
All young people do not happen to cope with the rapid changes to the social reality.
The Russian Federation, the Länder and communities were already working with determination to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
This does not only affect both the integration of immigrants.
'Several summits of integration to conferences on Islam, it shows already its initial success.'
It is, however, too early to an end to alert.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no problems sociological or from the point of view of town planning as in France.
In the Paris cities in the north, young people were exposed to serious street battles with the police during the last night.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burnt.
Greater efforts to integrate the part of the German Government, that is what is necessary for President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the riots in France, Kolat were in the 'effects of imitation'.
The situation in Germany would certainly not as explosive that in France.
But it would remain, however, a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes the fact that the quota of unemployed among young people under 25 years of immigration would be higher than the average.
We must primarily ensure more seats to training.
Kolat insisted: 'We must give young people a perspective'.
President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in the family was no longer take place in Germany and France.
Many young people from immigration do not want in addition to destroy what their parents have built here.
Calling Kolat: 'But we must be careful.'
It should quickly give young people the opportunity to participate in the work and training '.
In the meantime, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was hovering overhead the area with the spotlight.
The authorities in post have expressed three arrests and of some cars and burnt rubbish.
Since the conference a deployment of around 1000 security forces ensures calm.
The police will speak for as long as is necessary, annoncait the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit by a suburb.
During the night of Tuesday, almost 80 policemen have been injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the next night, the unrest débordaient in Toulouse.
The riots éclatèrent after a traffic accident in which two young had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the public prosecutor, the police is not responsible for the death of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The utopian stage of the Chancellor shows that the coalition has finished with the substance - and there is nothing more to be expected of it.
In what country live at this Chancellor?
After his speech distressing in general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The accusation of focus too much on the policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel a sentence harsh and arrogant.
It is truly provincial, she said and has just shown that it does not understand what want to the criticism.
In Parliament, it has made visible all how important this accusation was correct.
There was no specific interest or little feelings for the problems of the country to feel.
Instead, Angela is presented as a cloud: a politician in perfect weightlessness, fleeing in foreign policy and even then remains within the à-peu-près.
For example climate protection: in this field, it welcomes again and again on the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives must be achieved in our countries.
Even the praises of others – have so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused even two years ago.
Now it is clinging to ready-made formulae, that growth would affect the people.
Hence it is destroying its image of pragmatist, which solved the problems instead to embellish the world.
But in the domain of Angela cloud, the internal political problems a development which are marginal.
Poverty among children and the concerns of workers?
It remains a few sentences for this incidental.
In this area is indicative of the number of times makes a slip of the tongue when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three démarrages to deliver a sentence half precise.
It unsteady into new terrain, from the moment when it becomes concrete.
The Attaque branch
In the debate of Youtube republican candidates for the presidency, the favourite two Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard battle is offensive - and must now absolutely fear a candidate.
The tension erupts candidates already the first issue.
It would have done in New York a refuge for the illegal immigrants', reproach Mitt Romney his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
It against its hand by heavy criticism: 'I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants' answers Giuliani and criticises the former governor of Massachusetts to have used immigrants without papers.
The candidates to the attack: as the Republican basis has furthermore no official favourite, the eight presidential candidates for the use of the debates on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The films aficionados of 30 seconds that Internet users have sent via Youtube are barely more than souffleurs.
'It is with this kind isolate ourselves from each other that we have left Hitler come to power', would John MacKein to its candidate Ron Paul which is the only one in the dance to call for an immediate withdrawal of Iraq.
Romney also happens to be the lesson vigorously by the Vietnam war veterans, when it refuses to condemn torture as a so-called "Waterboarding ', a method of interrogation where we simule drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign, however go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture is in the reactions of the Chamber of St Petersburg common Florida.
That the conservative values leased are or the future increases of taxes should be rejected, the applause déferlent in the auditorium.
This is that are once again where the weaknesses of the favourite two.
"I have made a mistake in this time ', seeing explains Romney and his apologies to the basis and the public to be television in 1994 been a supporter of abortion.
Giuliani the opposite happening in a crux coulant when we asked their opinion on the littérales interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf exists for the first time in civil.
A day after its resignation as head of the army, the man of power in Pakistan President Musharraf has been invested as President.
And eight years of domination by the army have been concluded.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf has been invested on Thursday for a new five-year mandate.
Pakistan has television broadcast live the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
President Musharraf has vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday it had forwarded its burden of the head of the army to its confident Ashfaq Kiyani and thus etait complied with international pressure, particularly that of the United States.
Eight years after its grip on power by a coup d'état without bloodshed, former General now prevails for the first time as head of marital status.
By this withdrawal of the post of supreme commander of the armed forces, General Musharraf had fulfilled the most important requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that President Musharraf was imposed on 3 November.
Even shortly after his investiture Musharraf will stand the state of emergency, according to the Attorney-General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thereby fulfils another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, that President Musharraf has occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers of its ranks, rejected last week all appeals against the re-election controversial the head of state on 6 October.
In the meantime five soldiers were killed in the tribal region in the north in Northern Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four other injured.
According to the recommendations of the spokesman for the army, a bomb exploded in a streets near the border of Afghanistan.
The founding fathers of the Krautrock do their return.
The supergroupes Germany of the seventies rejouent: the three members of the group Harmonia have again taken their reassured in a concert in Berlin.
For their return are published the recordings of their great success' Live 1974 '.
At that time, they were much more known abroad.
The planned sensational happens again in the form of three gentlemen announced to the poster at night.
Everyone has its small boite before him, his cable and above all its buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, is in the middle of a white shirt as snow.
It is surrounded by the left of Michael Rother, young 57 years and in possession of a portable computer and guitare.
In the right, observed by all the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years, on its reassured curve.
Everyone contributes to noise, among other even a Beat.
And sometimes it is inadvertently added to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem too disturb the people themselves.
The fact that the group Harmonia plays again secured some agitation among the Krautrock fans.
It has the right to unveil here: targeted surveys show that, obviously, the name argues in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case of sustainable manner so that this group also lack painfully for 32 years.
But why German would it not have the right to celebrate its living legends of the 1970s?
Because what is called trompeusement 'Krautrock' has always more agreeable in Britain and America than in the countries of origin.
Lorque music industry has awarded in 2003 the Echo prices to the survivors of the group of Cologne Can for their work, we have seen in the Chamber the faces German pop interrogateurs.
When the Red Hot Chile Peppers have thanked the groups The Düsseldorf and Neu! in pricking praise, puzzlement did more limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother sautait on the scene of the Red Hot Chile Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration into the unknown is the only.
The memory is of this fact déja taken by Harmonia, because the trio has existed for two years and during this period, the power of impact which has felt was much weaker than what has been awarded him afterwards by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the name of Cluster very promising.
We joua firstly in the cellars below the Berlin stage.
Secondly in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the Church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly dépanné in Kraftwerk and has proved a name as guitariste with Neu!, who was at the time perhaps the German group the most radical.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the fôrets of Weserbergland.
Here, in a former Weser firm, the downfall of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological that within the community 'Kommune i', where Roedelius had the right to tick off as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So-called was in the dustbin a fanion the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many retint Harmonia far from that.
The first is album was termed 'Musik von Harmonia', and that 'De Luxe'.
Because as calm and measly that sonnait music, the group had material misery.
The harvest of dead wood is not in itself the search for itself.
The CDs' Live 1974 'which has just seem has been recorded in a public together to Griessem before a record of nearly 50 head, as someone believes remember.
Rother issued at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was for Roedelius Moebius and a requirement immoral.
The Group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother atterit in the spheres of the ésotérisme and assura its existence with albums as' Flammende Herzen '(hearts in flames).
So-called cluster will réanima in the 1980s and has since most successful Harmonia that have never existed.
We must the Live album of Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its Grönland label has set itself the aim of maintaining the Krautrock as German contribution inherent in the contemporary music.
Neu! had déja been dug up to this opportunity as the effect of Roedelius staff.
The physical revival of Harmonia took place in the House of the cultures of the world in Berlin.
Subventionné publicly, in the framework of the Woldtronics Cinema.
Julian Cope is, the British, former 17-year-old punk and author of pocket 'Krautrock Sampler'.
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr Motte.
By which the whole of the fluctuation band of the influence of the Krautrock would be identified with the future pop music.
The place left behind by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno is hanging in the Chamber in the middle of the strange noise: 'The only real music, you listen to the future'.
There are photographs which show the producers with Harmonia in the room of the firm.
The projections other photos in black and white in a bazaar cable tools used to training the myth.
Before, the three veterans are once again to improvise.
But more in the follow-up to the microphones underpants and the battery, to draw the instruments of noise, by means of the instruments to unheard-of effects built oneself.
Today, the electronic music like music electronic.
The three major fignoleurs of technical.
In that even the choir of the house did nothing.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, and chuchote coughing fit under the cloud of noise, and crowed to a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah 'with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a concept very English.
It has never rock is.
The roots have been less looked in the blues music in the conservation of music (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
Anyone who cry out '68' has not totally wrong, and also Harmonia is now more annoying for this now.
But what will the most itself will be covered in detail on the scene.
When is the music and where does it end?
This can ploughing the nerves of someone (?) or grant fugaces moments of joy.
Richard Gere is simply not enough cynical.
With 'The Hunting Party' and 'murderous Peace', two new films bash the war in the Balkans.
But the two do not convince.
Either the projects are based too much on the action and on the exchange of senseless firing is on the contrary they are too larmoyants.
Here, even Richard Gere in 'The Hunting Party' cannot help.
The good news first: of course war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely here, in the hinterland as mournful of the war in Bosnia, Richard Gere player is found.
We had finally lost sight of the principal man of the 1980s, because too many roles and futils gentillets in films to feelings for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have pleased the desire to be.
Richard Gere suddenly today is the most important argument for look when even 'The Hunting Party' - when the hunter becomes the driven out (why films today should be as long confused that collective locomotive drivers?)
It gives a magnificent full representation of clins of eye: basically his person to postpone of war Simon Hunt, is what Gere could become, if the destiny and industry of films were not also accommodating: a man who has the best of times long behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruins in terminal decline, has, however, remained visible waste of his former charm.
But despite this asset, 'The Hunting Party' continuing together with the German production 'murderous Peace', which fate as this week, the continuation of failed films on the war in the Balkans.
'murderous Peace' can be quickly the trial: the film about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a of Kosovar Serbs mavericks simply, in which one of the two still falls in love promptly.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are for once not presented as the only causes for all ills, this also film dish that a téléfilm is far too quickly in the action and exchanges of senseless firing.
This is a kind of 'Alarme Cobra for 11' without motorway, but with a war in its place.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of 'The Hunting Party', why basically there has never been a true good film on the war in the Balkans.
The history of the three American war looked, who determine to seek out the high war criminal 'the fox set', could perhaps become, with another filmmaker and another (all scriptwriter both Richard Shepard), at another time a new ‘ Apocalypse Now '.
Because there are similar stories aptly: male two are in small team in the forest, to achieve something that the military cannot do and for the two male it becomes a tour of the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of 'The Hunting Party' is that it would simply not be cynical Simon Hunt left with a heart, as it is presented at the beginning.
No, the script must give it furthermore an adventure with a romantic Bosnian murdered subsequently.
Then, 'The Hunting Party' is definitely wrong when the delay, in the space of the last five minutes, by a fast-track procedure, manages to what NATO, the CIA and all the premium hunters of the world have not succeeded in five years: catching the war criminal and allow for a fair revenge for the Muslim Bosnians.
This is so poor that we should seize the International Court of the Hague of crime against the logic of cinema.
In this case, the film has a human concern too extensive.
It wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and I suspect the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agree) not lead hunting fairly intensively due to political agreements secret.
But the good intentions and the villain are this time so that a famous similar poême Brecht we came to the idea.
The report speaks of a wooden mask an Asian demon on the table of work of poête: 'Compatissant, I see his of front gonflées, clearly: as is fatiguant to be malicious.'
The films such as' The Hunting Party 'have exactly such head tumescentes, but that implies that it is fatiguant to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the war in the Balkans.
Recently, it has been reported in the newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were great flops.
We can add: there has never been of good films on South Africa.
What applies each time: when a star periphery of an outbreak of crisis or on a minefield, it has then something like ‘ Rangoon 'with Patricia Arquette,' Jenseits go Grenzen 'with Angelina Jolie or ‘ Blutdiamanten' with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all of these conflicts are simply too close in time.
Nevertheless, decades have always gone before Hollywood can turn a good film on the Holocaust with 'The list of Schindler'.
Certain films should even mature - those who are today of traditional works on Vietnam, 'The Deer Hunter ’, ‘ Apocalypse Now' or 'Full Metal Jackett', in no case have they been fêtés unanimously to their time as Heads of practice.
But perhaps we know today simply too on conflicts of the world, where each massacre is screens live on both at the same time at home.
And this happy to scénaristes the lack of scruples they need to talk of fine stories.
'to be or not to be' or 'The dictator' are in fact become as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin do not yet know how the Nazi regime really prevail.
Perhaps we should not attempt to be good if one wants to make good flims.
Perhaps we should have the artistic sarcastic and distancé of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When we have asked about the parallel between its historical novel 'Dictionnaire of Lemprière' and the war in the Balkans, he replied: 'it is up to the fact that certain things are never change'.
'The big cities will always be dangerous appallingly, men will always be murdered a facon horrifiante and war in Yugoslavia will always.'
Von Beust harvest for the cancellation of the criticism which.
The decline of the Mayor of with the candidature of Hamburg for the Olympic Games to been met in politics and the economy to vehement points of criticism.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the brink of water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in assessing the chances.
The Director of the Chamber of Commerce to Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described abandoning Wednesday as' bad for the local economy '.
In recent times, no other project had shown the same motivating forces in the city that which the idea of.
'If this objective, the momentum politico-sportif could not have been retained in the same measures'.
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new point of departure in the longer term, 'which takes as its starting point another amended agenda'.
The Mayor Ole von Beust in remained on Wednesday at its previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
'This is not Hamburg which decides to a candidacy which to, but the umbrella organisation of Olympic sports' Von Beust said to WELT ONLINE.
It renvoit expected to the decision of the Federation of Sport in early December, on the candidature of Munich in the winter games of 2018.
The means for us, that in the time that we had expected until 2028 so far, we have no chance. '
However the dream is not definitively in the past, said Von Beust.
The sporting Federation of Hamburg (HSB) cannot find the statements of Beust.
That the impression is given that Hamburg no longer wishes to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
'It is too soon to close an opportunity, in the projects already manage now', said on Wednesday President of HSB Günter Ploß.
The abandonment of the application would be more in contradiction with the statements of the Chairman of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in plenary assembly of the German Federation of colleges of sport.
There, Von Beust would have described the candidature of Hamburg to 2015 Universiades as being "not a substitute" to the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of colleges of sport was first in the course of recent weeks nominé Hamburg as candidate city.
The PSE Group of the mayor reproached the Senate not to have used this valuable time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
'The development of Petit Grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it has played the map of and which has excluded the construction of housing', the SPD representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for the Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan in which a subsequent use and housing, the CDU would have banked exclusively on 'factor Event.'
The candidature for the Olympic Games to have been in 2012 for its part raised in Hamburg much enthusiasm.
However, Hamburg had broken against Leipzig.
It is not the coffers of Warhols.
That linking the concepts Sweden and wooden box, Ikea in mind, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or if?
At the moment, of timber coffers manufactured in Sweden the shadows are on the list of works of Warhol.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxs' Type Stockholm 'catalogued there are contrefaÇons.
After that the Swedish newspaper 'Expressen' has questioned, a few months ago the authenticity of Brillo-Boxs of the year of Andy Warhol 1968, the internal investigation of the Stockholm Museet Moderna result today at a result désenchanteur: the six 'Brillo-Boxes', which the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten made gift in 1995 to Moderna Museet, are copies - and a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen 'Type Stockholm', which are circulating on the international market.
History is enchevêtrée, a chain of artistic and curatoriques disconcerting productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York its first "Brillo-Boxes', of public-funded painted in wood, based on design rouge-bleu-blanc cardboard boxes soap powder 'Brillo'.
An exhibition of his work on Moderna Museet presented in 1968, with the agreement of Warhol – hundreds of public-funded Brillo made cardboard: they did not originate from (for financial reasons) by Warhol, but had been directly exposed to the cartonnage Brillo.
It is not a question here of works of art, but rather their models of samples of exposure.
At the same time, Warhol had given authorisation in 1968 to produce a few cases in wood Brillo in Sweden, who were not exposed to Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today about fifteen wood-based coffers at the time would be entries of law in the history of the art and of auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Wahrol permitted, with the appelation 'Type Stockholm'.
Some of them have achieved in the auctions over 100 000 dollars.
The problem now is that the director of the legendary museum Pontus Hultén claimed, wrongly, later that around one hundred wooden funds had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have assigned to him.
In truth, the 105 Hultén funds have been produced in Malmö in 1990, to exposure to St-Pétersbourg.
On that date, Warhol was already death for three years.
Lars Byström, as leader of the Conservative Moderna Museet, has examined, alongside the six Brillo-Boxes of museum, three other private collections suedoises, including two were confectionnées in Stockholm in 1968: their banners stratifiés were first printed and poncés, then it has applied with a bottles of paint to olive oil.
The texture copies which date back to 1990 unveils instead that the paint industry has been directly applied without layer of substance on the banners stratifiés, with the aid of a steam paint – more, it is not a painting to olive oil, but a acrylique.
'These cases have not been authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol', suggests the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: 'If the Andy Warhol Authentication Board' its purest form in New York do not just another decision, the Moderna Museet classified without regard for the six coffers in its collection as copies / exposure material. "
As long ago as July the Authentication Board naturally has announced, that we look into the 'serious accusations' which will be raised in the case of public-funded soap powder.
But since there is there a halo inéxorable silence.
