The shortage of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
The empty tracks pose no problem as operators of ski slopes.
Lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski holidays in hotels and pensions.
Thus, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year
We have a lot of hits on our website.
Customers travel deals, asking prices but dare not commit to book yet.
And they call us, they immediately ask if there is snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend New Year's dreams in Spindleruv Mlyn, it is better not to hesitate to book too.
If we give priority to savings and quality of accommodation not just afterward, so we can try to wait another few days.
The hotel does offer to Spindler for the moment that stays of one week for the New Year
I think they will try one more time to invest, but they will give in and accept them as shorter periods.
And then the number of available rooms will decrease rapidly, "said Jandura.
The tour of Ingtours Vrchlabí yet also offers beds free for all periods of winter.
Christmas week we are most interested at the moment, it is not completely sold.
He remains free, say, half the rooms in our offer.
Therefore we have prepared some Christmas holidays last minute cheaper, "said director Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The tour of Vrchlabí can also offer the New Year Krkonoše, but there are fewer empty seats.
The first fourteen days of leave in February as well, the remaining winter stays are selling moderately.
This year, the interest stays winter was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People expect it starts to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, as Christmas is complete, "Schiefert think.
Alternatively, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of almost five percent.
We still have a few last places for New Year as Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays in January and February of Poland is selling well too, "informs Karel Rada, director of best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel car park near the central Jánské Lázně is also full to eighty percent during the New Year
Instead, half the beds are empty at Christmas in the newest hotel of Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already sixty percent occupancy at present.
February is a little low at the moment but once the snow is falling, interest stays in the Krkonoše certainly grow further said the director of the Omni Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The hoteliers of Krkonoše however, should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and there is precipitation, they should be snow in the mountains.
But thereafter, the weather should be warm, informed Jiří Jakubský station in Hradec Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the painstaking effort with which Barack Obama, President's reputation wise, mimics the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, he regarded himself as quite simple.
When he eventually let her sweat doctrine so eagerly awaited, it turned out he had copied the carbon paper from the timeline of Bush's Iraq three years ago.
Not content to use in the text several times the phrase "as in Iraq," he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as part of its own discourse: " A new way forward "
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending reinforcements in Iraq consumed by civil war as "irresponsible and a decision in its catastrophic consequences."
The following months have shown, however, that the Bush strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of commanders campaigns, was the only possible and likely success at this point that the newspapers today do not speak at all about Iraq.
This did not improve the reputation of Bush, having said that, objectively speaking, he left his successor a final situation much more favorable as could be hoped.
Barack Obama hopes that Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
This is again the campaigns of commanders who have called for increased military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal that even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He demanded 40 000 men in order to make the situation better.
The president hesitated for three months but if a better option, he defrauded at least 10 of the General 000 soldiers.
He managed to extricate the promise of additional 5 000 from Europe, although there were 10 000 at the origin.
What causes the most problems in any of Obama's strategy appears to be its intention to withdraw the forces from Afghanistan within 18 months to complete this process within three years. Any doctrine Obama brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase in half take the same fruits that progress in Iraq.
In spite of the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its officers honor their agreements.
The Afghan situation differs from the exact opposite - you can not count on anyone and no treaty is respected.
In these circumstances, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, used to change the leader from day to day depending on what suits them.
Political institutions, though formally based, will just be a smokescreen behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state ready to act," which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem very real.
The time horizon of the strategy Obama is perplexing because of its voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a pure heart romantic and out of reality can be confident that the young soldiers sent to the tumult of war for their "speedy return home" will bring is a miracle.
From a political standpoint, set a date for withdrawing troops is irresponsible purely because the Taliban consider as indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan moving towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or do not want to explain to their constituents how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that the strengthened sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans find themselves facing the difficult issue of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
He will respond, for example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this kind will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Obama is that he stays three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for that board on a new strategy, if it would prove to be a total fiasco .
The leaders of Goldman Sachs will receive more rewards in cash
Employees senior leaders of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will receive this year from cash bonuses.
The company has announced in response to strong criticism about its pay practices.
The group of 30 key executives will receive shares instead of cash, they can not sell before five years.
Shares may be withdrawn leaders if they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs and arises in the lead of the effort to link remuneration with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning to be taken, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott society JPMorgan
The concern lies in the details, "he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after having set aside nearly $ 17 billion for bonuses on the first three quarters of this year.
For the year, total premiums will likely exceed 20 billion dollars despite the announcement made today, according to Reuters.

In defense of his policy he added that in some situations war is necessary for peace, even if the price is high.
Janota Minister intends to resign. Klaus was invited to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who weighs his time in government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was passed by the House of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota cabinet will be the agenda of their appointment on Friday.
Klaus also criticized the budget.
He said the deficit is too large, thus increasing further the public finance crisis.
It is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who briefed the meeting.
Janota will then discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget will be submitted for signature by Klaus, is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should be managed.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies Wednesday endorsed the proposals of the Left about the money transfers and increased rewards for staff, operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused the Social Democrats' proposals that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent dispute arose between the left first, the government, Klaus and the right second, disagreement calls into question the future of the firm of Fischer, who had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the CSSD and the Greens Party.
Critics say that the budget as voted by members, removes the package of savings measures passed by the government of Fischer and his opinion must contain the state debt.
Klaus, who may ratify the law on state budget but nothing obliges, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs that policies have long neglected the "serious problem "from the" uncontrollable loss "of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no positive solution.
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, it could rely on a consensus of political parties broader, as the president.
The chairman of the ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is staggering and that the government should question its future existence.
The Vice-Chairman of the ODS Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an office administrative support by the CSSD, the ODS and the Greens will work more clearly.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words as "drastic verdicts.
The leader Jiří Paroubek CSSD reacted to Topolanek, said that the budget deficit for this year prepared by the former government of Topolánek is staggering and it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Wednesday already, the CSSD has trained successful ratification of the state budget for next year.
The Popular Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in new movie by Clint Eastwood
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, the South African claim that the new Hollywood movie Invictus - Unbeaten world to expose a lot about the country, its struggles and victories.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, actor award at the Oscars, the film embodies the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said that Mandela is an old ninety-one years asked him to embody in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him: "If I have to embody, I should be able to see you personally ..
The actor sixty-two who was awarded a prize for his role in the drama Milion Dollar Baby Clint Eastwood's located in the middle of boxing, for example, played the leader of a movement against the 'slavery has itself become a slave, a fictitious U.S. president, even God in the film Evan Almighty, but never someone still alive and as important to many people that is Mandela.
The former statesman of South Africa has been imprisoned 27 years for his hard work towards the end of apartheid in South Africa.
It was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for peace.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the rugby team of South African Francois to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country resteencore and still racially divided and economically after apartheid.
He is confident it can unite his people through sport and decides to join the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world rankings.
The South African team will eventually move into the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked for several years to bring the story of Mandela on the big screen.
I had no other goal but play that role so as to bring as much reality, "said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me it was safe to talk like him
The actor said that if he and the politician International were in the same region, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, being backstage before his speech.
Most important for him to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get your energy, it is transmitted and felt how you feel, "he said.
It is important for me to try and become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the movie Francois Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh environment of rugby.
For him, his first encounter with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I rang the front door, he opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I look much bigger in the movie.
Despite the differences between actors and models real Invictus under the leadership of director Eastwood has received positive reviews and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety newspaper summed up his assessment in these words: "It is a very good story, a film very well done."
In scores of films on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive feedback.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
We observed a strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway.
The Department of Defense has acknowledged yesterday Russia had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch has however been a failure and the type of missile "Bulava" which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its presence in repeated tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the successful test flights.
Most of the time, or Bulava has not flown, or it was damaged in flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" like "missile that does not fly"
A missile does not fly but which shines
The 13th trial was going to start normally.
It was not until the end of the flight that there was again damaged equipment.
This is clearly the engine of the third floor of the rocket exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew submarine's nuclear Dmitrij Donskij who sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired just a moving boat and immersed
That is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely was probably a "Bulava" defective.
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that he is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we can not speak of absolute failure.
The first two floors of the rocket and have withstood the damage that has touched the third.
In previous cases, the engines have been failures on the first floor.
Even if none of test launches has passed without a hitch, the direction of the Department of Defense considers that only six out of thirteen have been failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent filled so the general optimism and they always say one day "Bulava" fly without problems and it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear cores weighing a total of 1.15 tonnes .
The legendary Fetisov signed for 51 years a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow
The legendary defenseman Vyacheslav Fetisov will appear again in a professional match at age 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will lend a hand to his team CSKA Moscow in need and will enter probablementdéjà during Friday's game against Petrograd.
Fetisov, who ended his career at forty in 1998, is for now the president of CSKA.
After the injury Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and is willing to help the team.
We must still resolve some details on the form, "said club coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP.
It was not clear whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those able to strengthen the mind of other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the event of his return to the ice, Fetisov became the player of Russian professional hockey oldest.
In NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford and earned 15 goals and 26 assists.

In the second part of his career, he also reaped the tributes in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He is a member since 2001 Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The factory management Hyundai Nošovice has agreed with unions to cancel all overtime.
Precisely because of frequent overtime that unions have declared a state of emergency Monday strike.
The spokesman Petr Vanek of the Hyundai plant was confirmed.
The management wants to save but still agree with the unions worked on a Saturday this year.
We can not forego our production plan, it is essential that's why overtime volunteers were offered Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, "said Vanek.
The site Sedmička.cz said that the company has proposed a CZK 400 bonus to employees who would be part of the team Saturday.
It is also assigned a posteriori to the working day November 28.
The company, according to Vanek, decided to change the way of motivating his employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can be a replacement leave December 28 and prolong their holiday year-end aindiqué Vaněk.
Besides that all employees present on Saturday will be compensated for the costs of transportation and lunch.
Given the fact that overtime was not the most urgent and warmer in the comments and claims of unions as employees who have voluntarily ceased production last week, management has decided to cancel all immediate overtime for the month of December, "said Vanek.
Until last week, employees of the car factory were forced to work almost two hours more daily in addition to eight hours.
The unions have set aside the state to strike after signing the agreement.
The next trading between factory management and auto unions must take place Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said Wednesday they were ready to stop the state to strike if agreement on their demands and signing a joint document.
The situation at the plant peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 workers have been on strike spontaneously due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor conditions and wages of alleged hazing.
Management has defended the fact that employees had to work extra to meet the requirements for automobile production.
In announcing the strike Monday, the unions have also asked that employees who have ceased production are not subject to any sanction.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a fee of 5 000 SEK (209 €) for them.
The Hyundai car factory Nošovice currently employs 2 000 people.
It began mass production last year in November.
It has produced about 80,000 vehicles until September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Discover Czech: a substance that works on HIV "steadfast" as
A team of German and Czech scientists test new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved material is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed an immunity to drugs.
The reality is, in some cases, over the fact that the combination does not work as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
One can nevertheless dramatically extend the lives of patients through a combination of drugs that inhibit the multiplication of HIV in the body.
Their use, however, entails a series of side effects.
Further suppression of this multiplication effect the development of so-called viruses resistant to which drugs are most effective.
The experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague VŠCHT and the University of Heidelberg opens up a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes affect the protein responsible for viral replication of HIV.
The metalocarboranes are a blend of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a manner different from all the drugs used until now and therefore they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work led them to discover new substances "improved" on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bonds on proteins of the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two cages multiple walls are formed by atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A virus resistant traitor.
The HIV protease is an HIV protein that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of HIV caused by HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of virus.
If you stop the HIV protease, it will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers said in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A somewhat smaller but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the HIV protease was tested in test tubes as well as its resistant variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
In the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as the clinical drug, however it does not weaken the resistance against which releases the current medications are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their chemical and biological stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are interesting combinations to be examined further to move towards the development of drugs effective against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the Laboratory of Structural Biology Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over the budget. The ODS blames Fischer, who defends
The chairman of the ODS (Civic Democrats), Mirek Topolánek has described as "staggering" the ratified budget for next year and he said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The prime minister called the remarks of the ODS drastic verdict.
He said take time to analyze.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of an office administrative support by the CSSD, the ODS and the Green Party did not work more clearly.
According Nečas, the head of government should decide s'ilprend to the House of Representatives support the minority who cares to fight against the growing deficit, or if he cares to stay in his office with the help of parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats over the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, however the proposed amendments to the tune of 12 billion crowns included the left.
The House has increased money for staff salaries, operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government complaint against the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, thus obeying the wishes of the government as a budget which is a modified variant less bad than the interim budget.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feelings of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office if the ratification of proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, took Janota appointment Monday with Prime Minister after his time in government:
He said while he wondered whether he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue the fight against the deficit, Nečas believes that representatives of the CSSD, which imposed changes in the budget, have no place in government.
The Prime Minister should also be clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other legislation increasing the deficit, such as those involving health insurance, pensions, or reform the law on services.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS is not in question.
This is the case of Fischer Head of Government and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS did no harm, Topolanek said in a statement text from the United States.
He recalled that the vice-ministers of some departments claim to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas said that if Fischer decides to resign over the fact of conducting a struggle against the amount of fiscal deficit, "it is entirely logical and correct it based on the majority of which is currently left to the House. "
That said, he does not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I did not think and once it's up to the agenda so I will dedicate myself, said from the House reporters, the defense minister Martin Barták elected government precisely by the Democrats.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon to debate the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has backtracked at the request of Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would have probably voted Wednesday against the amended budget he had not specifically asked members to allow the Democrats vote on the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we're not little children, he responded to the question whether the ODS had not been subjected to criticism from the president of the Party the House or the country in negotiating the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have failed.
I knew when I gave up my tenure that what would follow in the coming months would be a takeover of the House and destruction of everything that was positive, reacted Topolánek himself.
According to the new schedules of the CD there will be fewer trains for the same charges.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from December 13 some express trains and regional less responsible and instead strengthen others.
The total coverage of transportation will decrease on day of entry into force of the new schedule of two percent compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including base rates and the reduced fare.
Examples are the inhabitants of the Ostrava region which will have more routes to the capital, the Railways will add a Pendolino train.
Instead, an express train will stop serving Bratislava.
There will be fewer fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the hotline Prague - Letohrad be drastically reduced.
Regionally, the largest decline in transport for the region of Hradec Králové eight percent overall, in contrast Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are canceled and the movement of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest changes we may see the introduction of a new hotline Milovice in Prague at the moment residents Milovice must change Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the commuter system Esko, whose opening is possible with the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The remote lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The CD will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk / Jeseník leave at intervals of two hours.
Travelers will no longer take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million SEK extra.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transportation and pay the railways next year a total of four billion crowns to adjust losses visible, the same amount this year. Regional trains are controlled by the regions who will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate to the tune of almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years until this time was still a year.
Railways like the system, which also explains that they have not resorted to a price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
The changes affect only the tickets a day ČD Net and tickets reduced Internet Eliska.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of CD Net increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of newly Eliška will depend on the distance traveled, whereas previously it was valid between the towns of a region selection and was a single tariff of 160 crowns.
Philippine rebels were still holding more than 50 people, children have been released

The history of South Africa for everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
The new Hollywood movie by Clint Eastwood arrives in U.S. theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official title Czech Invictus: Neporažený) and narrae part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against apartheid world famous returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody.
The Actor's legendary champion South African rugby has been assigned to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, returns critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
Full name Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela, was born June 18, 1918 at Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of mind in 1993 then he received the Nobel peace alongside de Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film has great expectations since it was introduced at a time when a part of South Africa is in full preparations for the World Cup soccer, and partly because the media are agitated by d ' alarming news about the increased racial conflicts and discrimination of people from the black majority to power.
According to AP, the reactions to the new film are at present quite positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to where key roles "strut" of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is, however, repeating his own words, proud of the film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and I am well prepared.
I also met several times personally Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - to recover his energy, he said during the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we can remember through the film's personality and message of Mandela.
It is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but for each individual he added.
Wear the jersey of the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the novel by British author John Carlin entitled to be freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave the people it depicts the South African defender of human rights during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman is trying so during the movie to pick two racial groups of people long divided and as Nelson Mandela in 1995 he entered wearing the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the World Cup, that Africa South had won then.
To have shown the lawn jersey, which is considered South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been a long standing ovation fourteen years ago mainly white audiences and was recognized by the white population.
Hopefully the football league will succeed in uniting the people again as one nation, "said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only" black "from the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the South African tense situation will improve.
The white South Africans are skeptical, however, as recently confided in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, rugby fan who fled to Great Britain.

A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the region Louny
A fire engulfed a transformer on the morning of society vines distribution center near the town of Vyskov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan spokesman Fire Ústí, there are six units operating on the fire.
They had originally allowed the processor to consume, but they have revised their opinion and extinguish the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical fault, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
Nobody was injured and according to the spokesman for the company Pavla Mandátova the incident did not endanger the safe operation of the entire transmission.
Damage is estimated at tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure will be known once the fire extinguished.
According Mandátova, destroying the transformer will be replaced by a new one.
She added that in ten years in business, society vines has experienced anything similar and that such incidents are isolated.
The electricity supply was not interrupted, said the spokesman for the company ČEZ Bohemia North Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova the functioning of households, government and industry has not been affected by fire the transformer station.
As vines is the exclusive operator in the Czech Republic sets of transmission and power lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
He maintains, renovates and develops 39 stations with 67 distribution transformers transfer electrical energy from sets to sets of transmission and distribution grids with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura will sue for defamation against three prefects ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency will now file a complaint for libel against three prefects Social Democrats.
And actually cons Michal Hasek in the region of South Moravia, Radko Martínka cons of the region of Pardubice and cons the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura stated in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál.
The complaint relates to the attempt by the company to operate regional railways in certain regions.
All regions but eventually signed long term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and say we made the poets, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech Railways, which were signed last week.
So it remains for us to defend ourselves.
In exchange calumnies about the company Student Agency, said the Jančura Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he reported evidence that no region has proceeded in line with European law.
We prepare for this complaint to the European Commission.
Hasek believes that the complaint of Mr. Jančura represents the result of his media spectacle that serves as free advertising for his company and himself.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and call the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this is an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Jančura gentleman who manipulates public opinion and uses false and deceptive arguments about regional rail transport, "said Hasek
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest several million crowns in an advertisement which shall indicate the steps unfavorable regions.
He said he Radiožurnál abort the campaign after Christmas and he intends to resume after the New Year
He said the campaign will target corruption at large.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions have agreed to entrust the Czech Railways operate the rail for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing tender.
According Jančura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to threats Jančura a member of CSSD.
The only threat was that if we did not stop, we could lose our licenses bus.
He introduced himself as member of the CSSD, I do not know who it is but I will not say his name, said today Jančura Radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcus is free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcus overturn old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Already some voices saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcus peak.
The institute defines pharmaceutical vaccines already the maximum prices that will pay for health insurance.
Specialists are also clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August
Since January, the children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcus.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If we started the vaccination last year or earlier, you must pay yourself the following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year one-quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
Yet parents paid 1600 crowns for one or more doses.
Vaccination of younger requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year health insurance spends USD 300 to 450 000 crowns doses of vaccine.
However, they save on medical care than unvaccinated children require.
So far the state was spending about 500 000 crowns per year for any child immunization.
Vaccination reimbursement was introduced with the package Janota.
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to surveys in hospitals, there are even 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination refunded.
Vaccination Will mandatory?
There is advice on a possible vaccination requirement in the future.
Starting in January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the association president Rudolf Kalovský Nahla said that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcus.
At an international conference in which our association has helped, experts were not really satisfied that we have a voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have at least impose this.
I think it's a direction that we must now follow Kalovský said.
But the health ministry does not change the process of vaccination against pneumococcus.
We did not look quite yet, said spokesman Vlastimil Sršen.
Optional Vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, President of the Company specialized pediatricians, recognizes that immunization is based on voluntary faults.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a lower renewal of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine costs a sum as I understand the decision making vaccination voluntary" said Cabrnochová however.
The experts predict that next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcus also marks a break because it's the first vaccination of children is financed by insurance and not the rule.
Cabrnochová said that insurance should release funds for prevention, they would save and on possible future medical care.
Physicians should buy their products themselves
This is however linked to the concerns of practitioners, pediatricians, concerning the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to buy vaccines through insurance, the doctors receiving the same manner as other products of vaccine provided by the state.
Some Members expressed their concerns that this would allow insurance "deduct amounts of health insurance.
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance reimburse them.
According to estimates, individual pediatricians will invest approximately 40 000 crowns per month vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according Cabrnochová.
Still us and them
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, fans of the last book of the author, "Why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), an elegant study, well documented on an issue that has divided and preoccupied the country since fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
The latest book by Mr. Bowen has a much wider frame and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes in France now provide this quem. Bozen-called "Muslim areas" for 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well listen to and reproduce the discussions between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
A Muslim has to marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
The evolution and gay rights have to be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman may marry a non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on interest for a loan?
These are practical problems, says he, are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas of concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab, born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not grow until after the debate.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts advocates of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today constitute a small proportion of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and secularism of French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved with the efforts of both sides.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite so fierce guardian of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
He said Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, he detects a "narrow core values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The sight of the darker world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than anywhere else on the planet.
The ice which is composed melting at an alarming rate, taking with her a life that can not survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, fishing expeditions and sailing into new waters open, with diplomats, lawyers and writers now in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, author and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
Aware of the history and policies Complicated whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were proven by hunting polar bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, while courageous midshipman 14 years who had to fight just the tip of his rifle, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
Young cubs, caught as they swam alongside their mother just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early twentieth century, a show celebrating 75 bears gathered together.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still typically a millionth of the area necessary for an adult release. the climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore has turned green because of algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells stories from other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where hunters helicopter and Inuit Indians jet ski use fusilsd'assaut powerful drive their game.
Ironically, it is in the shallow waters of the north of those two nations to hunt the ice remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist offers a clear and frightening to the science of the Arctic and a fascinating overview of what may be the future there.
Not that the scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists or oceanographers can accurately tell the speed of change.
This is not for lack of trying.
Late nineteenth and early twentieth, travel pioneers Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information about the melting icecap.
Submarines of the Cold War were then mapped changes undersea it.
The surveillance satellites and sensors placed on the iceberg are a great help, but most work is done by men hardened camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary world of tiny tributary system of the Arctic ice, formed by the threads of brackish water freezing in a hurry.
But the bear raised above the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the ice was provided between 2013 and 2050.

Marines, among the 6 000 people laid wreaths on the graves at Arlington
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19, has been a journey of seven hours by bus to make a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and other Marines who made the trip to Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina Cemetery Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, this day was devoted to salute the men and women who one day were their place.
In a few months, where we sent, we might be in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6 000 volunteers have gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in different sections of Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, has launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, are the annual trip, stopping in various cities on their way to organize celebrations in honor of soldiers and victims of terrorism.
Worcester also founded an association for nonprofit, Wreaths Across America (Wreaths Across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers have placed over 16 000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of the cemetery enArkansas Fayetteville National Cemetery in Battery Park in New York City and the site of the memorial for the victims of Flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Foundation Walmart Foundation gave more than $ 150 000 to buy and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career soldier who died.
Although her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed.
It's a small gesture that can civilians to support our troops, "she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked among the lawns and hills of the cemetery expanded.
The volunteers chose ancient tombs dating from the First and Second World War and the Vietnam War, because they are not visited as often as new tombs, organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while children were playing and couples holding hands, carrying the fresh pine wreaths on the graves gray.
Each had a round crown dark green, with a small red bow tie on top.
Nearby, hovering silence on Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations has given 1 000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of today's wars filled the area.
Some people wept openly, others prayed and families and friends is supported in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others are inclined to see the little information cards black and white and buried in moist earth for those whose graves had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on the grave of her son.
It is part of Zanesfield, Ohio and led to eight hours to pray over the grave of Sergeant Shane Spicer GunneryDavid Marine died in combat in July.
Nobody should ever forget what grace we are free ... my son has paid for it, "she said.
"Long after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested an American national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs U.S..
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc.., Based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested December 5.
The specific charges were not disclosed, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All activities so-called revolutionaries, including protests moderate and critical writings, run the risk of arrest.
Graffiti and anti-government speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers growing, led by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who writes frequently about how she and husband were followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez made several requests to leave the country to receive awards but the permissions have always been denied.
The detention of an American national will may increase tensions between the communist government of Cuba and brothers to the Obama administration is pursuing an approach that "soft" to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by The New York Times, Friday evening.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government lead by concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition to the United States to reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although it is consumer goods new and desired in a country where the average salary of an officer is $ 15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has given ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones: they are mainly used for texting or a conversation of 15 minutes which corresponds to a day's wages.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and foreign visitors in the country and in certain government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often must send their names to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few U.S. prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berben, press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berben said she could not provide details on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity which in any other company would be allowed - to distribute free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas Program director of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently issued a scathing report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his brother ill.
According Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and jailed the same day.
He said any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries began to initiate a better dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men into Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities have detected an organization supposedly preparing a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hoped the case would remove a large network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet looking for young men radicalized.
Investigators said they were hunting an insurgent hidden personality, known for Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after having discovered when one of them made comments endorsing the waves on the terrorist video site YouTube on the Internet.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote tribal belt of Pakistan, home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret service has been informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to persuade the commanders of al-Qaida that these men were not involved in the conspiracy of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network .
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains northeast become a haven for terrorism.
They were regarded as undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative authorities said the men were determined and they were always trying to obtain the necessary permits for entry into the camps of al-Qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of law in Pakistan.
The case of five men - who remain in Pakistan and questioned by the FBI - insist on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more important in determining the persons who give confidence.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. secret services were a priority to infiltrate men in the al-Qaida network.
Recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers, denying entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who can prove to be spies.
According to analysts, the U.S. potential recruits are studied closely by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their access to potential U.S. targets and their value propagandaire.
But Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups must also do more and more attention in recent years in choosing who they accept as U.S. intelligence became experts regarding their methods of recruitment.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model that many others have followed? Kohlmann said.
The model is one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants to call Copenhagen "action" on climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants marched in the streets here Saturday, calling for greater action on climate change on the part of negotiators working on the Bella Convention Center Convention Center in the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100 000 people, 25 000 but estimated the police.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked militants have turned on some explosives near a group of government buildings in downtown.
In this day when little happened during the discussions on climate change sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the town, displaying signs in English saying 'There is no planet B "and one in Spanish, saying" The Earth said it had enough ".
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the homeland of his mother, Peru, has opened his eyes to the harrowing problems faced by the country because of the impact of climate change already occurring. "
This is one reason why I decided to join the great march - to spread the word and launch an appeal to world leaders to take decisions that are fair, ambitious and committed, at she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said it had arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said it had arrested 19 people because they wore a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
A passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in discussions on climate, activists wearing masks and black clothes, lit several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen which is surrounded by some departments .
They threw them near buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, then followed by "several large explosions.
Inside the Palace of Congress, the people gathered around television screens to monitor the progress throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the conscience of the key such that Su Wei, the China representative for the climate.
When asked if he thought that event would have a positive impact on the international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, it's something I was not aware.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I can not hear what is happening outside."
He noted that the march might seem helpful or harmful depending on the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, "he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say they disrupt negotiations or they interfere with the freedom of others."
The test results show persistent differences between races
The federal report last week on mathematics achievement has brought good news for public schools in Washington DC
Although the District is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are far greater progress during the two years preceding that in cities like Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress) is the persistent gap between the outcomes of African Americans and whites, in terms both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white children in Grade 4 (CM1) to WashingtonD.C. increased during the past two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates African-American increased by only three points from 209 to 212.
The achievement gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only one point from 245 to 244.
The average score for whites was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overview of a period of six years is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1) when the first NAEP report was published in the District was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups had increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed concern that the increase observed by the Group Director of Schools Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were propelled by the white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the ladder, which is problematic and embarrassing, "said Jeff Smith, director of DC Voice, a group nonprofit that promotes equality in Education District.
I'm not jumping for joy for a couple of points earned, "said Kwame R. Brown (Democrat related), member of the Council of DC and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said the message of the test results is that the middle schools (colleges) in the city desperately needs attention.
Really, you always want to see positive signs and I respect him.
But what is scary is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading the Wilson Reading System, for the kids classes late elementary and early middle school who failed to incorporate the basics of reading more early in their school careers and are quite late compared to their peers.
Each day, the mathematics curriculum, for grades Kindergarten (Kindergarten) to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on games and experiences of real life, as they were introduced in the District by the former chief Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think that we must continue working to provide better assistance to those students below the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to boost overall system performance while providing the money and resources to schools with less well to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an instructor of education at the University of California at Berkeley who studies test scores of cities.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting may affect policies that interfere with this important program.
The problem, of course, is that like other schools superintendent, she tries to use the middle-class whites and blacks.
Our focus for the development of a system of good schools.
We must strengthen our city schools so that all families, regardless of the place from which they originate, are assured that their children will get an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the essential elements for reducing the achievement gap étaitla duration of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the District Washington to be in competition with charter schools.
It should get about 200 days for having the strength to change, "said Janey, who has come to an agreement with its teachers union last year for 185 days, he considers a" starting point "for still get an increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise of future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinked his eyes a moment at the sight of white pillars, the facades of brick and green lawns.
Graciela's parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Also, while she and other students in Grade 8 (4th) group explored Gettysburg where tuition is $ 38 690 per year, his attitude was less than an enthusiastic new student impressed.
Super's where I'll study! exclaimed Graciela wishing to study medicine, while the guide directed them towards the entrance of the Science Building.
Yay, really? she said thoughtfully, when he pointed to the low ratio law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh as visiting children in their journey of discovery and now three days, they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still largely to the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrants who have left school when they become parents as teenagers, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, a "Hispanic" second generation "on cinqpoursuit's high school - a significant achievement considering that many of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States United without completing high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they pave the way for future generations who will play an important role in the workforce of the country.
Researchers studying the swing state that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play an important role in helping Graciela and millions like her to get to university - especially if their efforts are regular and long term.
When you look at the children of low income families with parents who lack the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention at any time, do not help said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We must think of providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit universities Graciela is a good example.
Known for GEAR UP (get ready), it provides more than $ 300 million per year to local school systems to organize preparation programs at the university began when students from low income families are in middle school (college) and continue until late high school.
Since 1999 the program was attended by more than 10 million students, with over 60 percent entering college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi oil ministry obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure problems in two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in rehabilitating the Iraqi oil industry , struck down by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies are distributed with an interest in only two of 10 fields auctioned.
September U.S. companies had paid to attend the second auction, which began Friday.
The only had one bid has been lost.
Two U.S. companies have won contracts for the fields auctioned in June
The low representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies are companies in Asia and Europe leading the way, "said Ruba Husari, editor of Forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site of information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Concerns about safety, supported by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday and political instability while the U.S. troops withdraw slowed the U.S. oil companies, preventing them to enter with greater force in Iraq has the third largest crude oil reserves in the world, analysts say.
U.S. companies were in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose costs of labor were significantly lower and were more willing to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc.. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
U.S. companies most important, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and him have brought their technical advice, are left empty-handed.
Russian companies Gazprom and Lukoil were both shareholders in two major contracts awarded over the weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp.. Owned by the state, has bid on more contracts with other companies and is left with substantial interests in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy and a technological powerhouse, "said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Oil.

One of the main organizers of al-Qaida have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that a U.S. missile, which struck along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations of al-Qaida this week, said Friday U.S. authorities against espionage.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles in their car Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local officials said the missiles had been fired from an unmanned aircraft type used by the CIA inside the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border where the car was hit, said a Secret Service Pakistani civilians, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
Representatives of the authority stated that the premises suspected militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "body completely shredded.
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of victims, but the two representatives anti-American terrorists gave evidence that unspecified part of the Somali people.
Somali was described as one of the organizers Military Leaders of al-Qaida who directed the operations of terrorist groups outside of the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize conspiracies in the world, said an authority who requested anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the instructions strategic leaders of al-Qaida and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority has said that Somalia had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relationships with other extremist groups in the region.
It is perhaps not known to the general American public, but this does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official.
If her death is confirmed, Somali is the second important figure of al-Qaida or Taliban leader killed second since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, and three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by unmanned CIA has declined since the summer, about six transactions per month to two, according to figures developed by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a group nonprofit.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site says.
The Special Envoy of the UN in Kabul retires
The special envoy for Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday he would resign in March to the end of a tumultuous term marred by allegations of widespread corruption during the presidential election supported by UN.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration decided to send 30 000 troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the schedule for U.S. troop withdrawal to begin within 18 months and would require other NATO governments to withdraw forces.
We must accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, sending the right signal to Afghans and remind them they can have confidence in the international community, "Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international staff assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
Increased military must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign but simply respect the commitment he made to his family in March, did spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon knows now that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said it was better to start looking for my replacement, "said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to representatives of UN, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
The representatives say the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted, it is an Italo-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guehenno, a French who has previously directed the keeping the peace of the United Nations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan has been tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September to encourage President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections and conceal evidence of widespread electoral fraud.
Eide has denied the allegations but said that the charges Galbraith - who was fired - "have harmed the mission because there was already a healthy dose of skepticism regarding the International Election Observation" .
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the heads of the United Nations to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy regulation of hiring UN hindered its ability to bring new talent.
The UN rules are such that I could recruit a single person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it can not last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before an audience of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit from a week in the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has played down the possibility of military action against the Islamic republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a question from a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome. ¨
One thing that troubles me most is that if I learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictability inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates said that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranian street.
He said a "combination of incentives and punishments" would be needed to persuade the Iranian government that would actually lower security with nuclear weapons "since" his people suffer a lot 'of sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement of the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences "probable" if it does not reduce its nuclear program in full compliance with the Security Council of the United Nations and its oversight agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran keeps saying he wants to develop its nuclear test only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he said he would resume the dialogue on reducing its nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant portion of its storage of enriched uranium fuel in exchange for desperately needed Medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed into such an agreement, means to develop trust on both sides and to gain time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have receded attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the fact whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think the tightening of Iran face some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually given their agreement in early October, has prompted the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, come together on what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before it turned to other options, including further that the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has a Once called the "enhanced penalties".
In a statement Thursday in New York, Mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it called "unfounded allegations" of some members of the Security Council on nuclear activities of Iran and said that it was agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "to obtain a satisfactory long term."
Gates, who was returning to Washington later Friday morning met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region to the derencontrer Responsible troops in Kirkuk, and Kurdish Irbil .
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, especially on the borders, property rights and revenue sharing.
Gates has urged both parties to reduce the conflict potential in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops, 115 000 50 000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to allay the anxiety of the Kurds on the pending withdrawal. The U.S. authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you. "
In China's aging, a change of direction
Weijia Wang and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda poster of sermons, "The mother earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "One more baby is a grave and more.
They were so well learned the lesson that the authorities of Shanghai Government, alarmed by the rate of poor birth of their city and the aging population, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm forever.
We've already given all our time and our energies to one child.
There remains no second, "said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and has a son 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of one child in China, creating two generations of children known to be unique with chubby cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatening the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, then it is expected that the number of residents 60 and older will explode, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning) said that fertile couples should have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of population aging and prevent a shortage of manpower in the future. "
Shanghai is about to become "too old - but not as rich, though - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual reduction
Posted in the country's constitution in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child so far is undoubtedly the most controversial requirement introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines - up to three times their annual income - and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while lawyers for Human Rights denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of authority have forced women pregnant with her second child to abortion.
In addition, many couples have used selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys - girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of one child.
In 2004 they were granted more exceptions to the rule - including residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which man and wife are only children already - and in 2007, they have softened many of their slogans hard.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of Population Research) at Peking University, said that central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such that allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families to having only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations detailing who is eligible to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has dispatched officials to family planning and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and drag prospectus under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those wishing to have more than one child.
According to the official family planning, the response was disappointing.
Answer disappointing
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the most urban district reported that there had no change.
The common Huinan, with a population of 115 000 inhabitants, for example, continues to receive four to five applications per month.
Officials of Shanghai, disappointed, argue that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165 000 - slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the town of Caolu Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to fill their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and they are legally entitled.
But like many Chinese, they have only minimal health insurance and life insurance provided by government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly believe that the policy of one child is a rights issue, "said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
True, we steal the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is money.
Other reviewers cite psychological reasons to explain their reluctance.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she only wanted a single child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and had a habit that everyone takes care of us."
We did not used to taking care of someone else and we do not really want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company says more bluntly.
For couples with two working, middle class, that lower birth rates, he said, he must be selfish pourbien succeed.
People 20 or 30 years have grown up watching their parents fight in the early days of China's capitalist does not want to have their own style of life, "he said.
Even one child takes time from his parents, he said.
A parent must give at least two years of his life.
Then there are space problems - "You must change your apartment" - and planning - "When your child is only 9 months, you must write a CV for a place in the highest maternal .
Most of his friends are ready to experience this once, "said Chen, but not both.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, "he said.
We do not make too many sacrifices.
The UN group has draft plans for reducing emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the UN - so far characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations - has returned under the spotlight Friday because of the publication of a document outlining the reductions ambitious greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden in the coming time.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, said the remaining obstacles, as it has illuminated the path to take.
But it was seen as a breakthrough in negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 world leaders arrive next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a special working group of the UN, the text does not say how many rich countries give to the poor to withstand global warming, short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how the developed economies and emerging economies could further reduce their carbon output and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that would be responsible willing to tolerate.
It provides great flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, at Washington Representative of Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote a six-page document, considered a negotiating text of 180 pages to focus on what describes the Executive Secretary General on Climate Change United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as " the complete picture ".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which the industrial nations reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while the major countries in the developing world during the same period, would reduce their 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent for 2050.
The European Union has also revived negotiations Friday, promising to provide $ 3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to impacts of climate change - to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
But Friday, the same verbal altercation occurred, which have dominated the negotiations last week.
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States to the negotiating climate has rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by industrialized countries, compared to voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not financed by developed countries.
This change is a sign that the Obama administration becomes harder to China that the Bush administration has been two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of key countries in the developing world, "said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not sufficiently to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei has said that the U.S. chief negotiator, or lacked "common sense" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help financially China to fight against global warming.
With the economic future trajectories of major world powers involved, defects appeared both in the Third World and between the industrial and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about the rescue of individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States are squabbling over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist on the fact that two dozen countries most influential ignore the scientific requirements to act more boldly.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, although the country had become more vulnerable aggressive in their attempt to make major emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game which is developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also adviser on climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change said they would continue to put pressure for a treaty legally obliging in Copenhagen, although most of the key participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States which includes 43 members, has prepared a draft treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of Climate Unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the entire political process, partly by what they are now unified and they want to emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become an urgent matter, while the delegates focused on the fact that they had resolved most issues pending before government leaders reach an agreement.
The high-level officials such as the Environment Minister of India, Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice-Minister disembarked from their plane and rushed into the building at the Bella Center to attend meetings behind closed doors and Conference information, in order to make claims that will be studied during the following week.
The real image of the rally - during which 13 000 people enter and leave the Convention Center each day - activists guitar players have nightly performances ridiculing the country that they believe themselves betrayed and that proposals are drafted and distributed on paper rather than by email - is a real challenge.
The intensity only increased: almost all ministers are important here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the big league, "said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The trucks arrive.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km / h will redefine syndrome Monday
At 5:13 am Monday morning, a whistle pierce the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution in transport in Great Britain.
The first commuter train at high speed in the country will reach 225 km / h, then it will spin Ashford, Kent, London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first train commuter Javelin outside London.
He hopes the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and will link the major conurbations of the Midlands and North of Scotland in London.
Small holes become lost suburbs flourishing times of business will be much shorter and the transition from plane and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to the project.
But ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle planning and the inevitable fears of dangers to the environment may dampen the high-speed UK.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to make the government a feasibility report, will make its paper to Lord Adonis December 30.
This will enable it to obtain a detailed map of the route the next step planned for high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five meters of the urban area and sites where environmental impact can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters of the final itinerary.
It is also anticipated that HS2 presents three options for a high-speed network bigger, going north.
Lord Adonis will meet in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a Y configuration where a high-speed go up West Midlands.
The line splits into two at or near Birmingham, with a branch running west of the Pennines and Scotland àManchester and another going north-east towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems to be the best option for performance 'said a professional track.
When this is completed, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with a trip today.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km / h, making the British network's fastest world.
The initial layout is designed to train 400m long and can carry 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a route London - Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given space constraints, it is anticipated that existing terminal will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
The industry experts say that the rail only St Pancras International and Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not believe that the project should be put in place, but the longer public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if the machine starts, the network will be built part by part.
The trains will initially be forced to roll off the lines at high speeds on existing track north of Birmingham, maintaining journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure planes to trains, providing a point of reference for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay back the loan of 75,000 GBP for the orangery Tory
Alan Duncan, Senior Tory member of parliament, made payable to the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orange grove he built his house in his district.
The party official who was demoted by David Cameron for having complained that MPs were "maintained", has increased its borrowing £ 75,000 to build an extension to his second oak house in Rutland.
He had been allowed to charge additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities have received complaints at that time and have not been interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who makes an expenditure control members. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could be "clearer and simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for nearly one million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, lounge and dining room, but the emoluments of office says that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a porch to the house, in describing his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors described her as "a conservatory for fun".
He was not asked Mr. Duncan to give any explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation made by the Committee of Privileges and standards of Commons on its borrowing arrangements beforehand.
The Committee has cleared last month of any accusation of non-compliance, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan has changed the legal borrowing of £ 271,406 of his property in London to his constituency home he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed around 1,400 GBP per month interest on loan until March of last year.
In April, its applications have increased by over 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS Mr. Duncan has not been changed at this time, suggesting that all increases were intended to fund the loan of 75,000 GBP.
The standard interest rate variable RBS fell 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since.
The last publication of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to ask £ 1250 in May
Duncan lost his position as Head of the shadow cabinet in September after an undercover journalist was allegedly filmed saying that members of parliament were living "on budget" after spending scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you must live" on budget "and you are treated like" the m ... e "
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and I asked a game based on what was correct.
and damn I could ask more, but I did not. "
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his former position as a trader in oil, began to have to explain his spending in May, after it emerged he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, front of agree with the office expenses that it "could be considered excessive.
An activist has dug a hole in the form of pounds into the lawn of Mr. Duncan to protest after it was revealed he had asked £ 4000 for three years.
Asked about increased borrowing last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved by both the office expense and by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of evasion or development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear in the rules allowed, etc..
It could not be clearer or simpler. "

Like Bousquet, almost all of the swimmers were wearing suits made of polyurethane, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
Originally 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which hosted the first in 1999 at the same competition.

USA: Polanski's lawyer calls again the non-prosecution
Counsel for the Franco-Polish director Roman Polanski was asked again Thursday at Los Angeles (California, western United States), the dropping of charges against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a sex scandal of over 30 years.
Chad Hummel, counsel for the director of "Pianist", was denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeals for the Second District of California of serious procedural errors at the time, in 1977.
I demand the surrender charges here and now, Hummel said, adding that the conduct of the judge handling the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling."
He said the judge Rittenband - since deceased - have discussed before making its decision, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison - which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired) of the mouth of the attorney in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells was finally declared the end of September had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
If the court refuses to drop charges, Mr. Hummel has called for a trial, which would allow him to present evidence of his argument.
The prosecution's side reiterated the arguments already developed at trial, namely that no surrender charges could be seriously considered as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The filmmaker, age 76, fled the United States in 1978, before sentencing, to "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a minor of 13 years.
He never set foot in the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor of the county of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, has said that Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the hearing.
In this case, do we send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski), but also to other defendants, it is possible to escape?, Asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "asks a favor at court, while despising his authority."
One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to make their decision - also emphasized "that there were other alternatives to the leak.
Mr. Hummel was not alone in seeking dismissal of the charges against Roman Polanski.
Counsel for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also claimed, again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that his client no longer stand being harassed at every twist of the Polanski case, she added: "Nobody in this room can say that the process was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough ".
Roman Polanski was arrested September 26 in Switzerland on U.S. warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was under house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.

Technology stocks lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.540% against 3.482% Wednesday night and that's good for 30 years at 4.497% against 4.492% yesterday.

The new Johnny Hallyday's "very positive", according to his son David
The new Johnny Hallyday's "very positive" Friday assured his son David on his arrival at the airport in Los Angeles where he was to visit his father's bedside in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very loud, it's going very well, told the press David Hallyday at the exit of the plane that brought him to Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (2100 GMT).
The son of singer, looking relaxed and assured that he was going "very fast" to the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was called Monday for an infection resulting from the operation of a herniated disc November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma last night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent suffering and be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection resulting from the operation of a herniated disc November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reoperated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of serious damage resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia Friday morning went to French school in Los Angeles where educated their daughter Jade to attend a performance school, found an AFP photographer.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Trauma Hospital de la Pitie-Salpetriere, Yves Caton said Monday he would travel to Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer was violently challenged Dr Stephane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer November 26 at the International Clinic in the Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, "said Camus.
I heard about a possible future legal process, "he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was "gone too soon to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon.
I had the doctor in person in line who assured me there was no problem for this trip and it amazed me, since I myself had two herniated discs, has he added.
Shortly before on RTL, it was reported that the singer was apparently "left no drain, no nothing," after his operation in Paris.
Dr. Stephane Delajoux is well known in artistic circles.
He made the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma following a brain haemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor in the sulfurous reputation, repeatedly condemned by the courts in cases of medical malpractice and tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the doctors, was accused of being "an unscrupulous man" continued "regular" before the Bar Council, which is "far from being recommendable.
After several days of silence, Dr. Stephane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was "very smoothly" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not bleeding and does not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, appears in parentheses.
Clearly, a resumption of the tour January 8 (in Amiens, editor's note) as expected, it seems very short, "said Camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and amount of the New Center to stop using its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the modem of François Bayrou, reacted Friday to the takeover attempt of the President of New Center, Herve Morin, the initials of the former party Giscardian, by giving notice of not more use in any medium, under penalty of prosecution.
Herve Morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym UDF, François Bayrou holding that did not deserve defending his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Herve de Charette (former UMP spent in NC) who claims ownership of the mark UDF for being the first to testify in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property .
But Friday night, the office of the Association UDF controlled by friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to leave dispossess, emerged from his silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and MP, demanding that they stop use the initials and their transfer ownership of the mark, on pain of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, the statements that you would propose for your political movement of + resume + acronym UDF, the association wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24-member board, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of MoDem and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist Alliance.
You have also seen fit to take on your hardware and activist on the front page of your site, the name of this movement, the New Center + + slogan + UDF + today, also note the signatories mail.
As you well know, you have no right to use this symbol, said the office of the UDF, which is still in the NC to withdraw "immediately mention the name of the UDF in any medium and of (its) website.
He also asked Herve de Charette "of transferring ownership of (the) to mark its legitimate rights holders".
If you did not do it, the courts would take to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF is a political movement in its own right since 1978 "and point out that Mr. Morin and his friends had" chosen "to leave in 2007" to create a rival movement, as d other had done in 2002 to create the UMP.
The new center has therefore, in their view, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 joining the Modem for three years and creating an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the training grounds by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As to Herve de Charette, said the office "when he filed the trademark" it was "most member of the UDF for three years, but the UMP.
He enjoys scandalously and the abscence of fraudulently filing acronym UDF to perform on his behalf.
This dishonesty is being transformed into a crime they denounce before the ironic strategy of NC: "It seems that in politics as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself Even to try to break the anonymity fraudulently taking a name that has not right ".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: Francois-Marie Banier be tried for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist Francois-Marie Banier to determine if, as acknowledge the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a weakness of the octogenarian for deprive a party of his fortune.
The photographer of 62 years, known for his photographs of celebrities, will be held on 15 and April 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offense punishable by a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and a 375,000 euros fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter tear while holding the reins of the empire of cosmetics L 'Oreal.
But the 15th criminal court also ordered a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years, should be taken collectively by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such examination, at least not in the terms proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor during the investigation.
DMPs Friday will provide a report by March 10, 2010 in particular saying if Liliane Bettencourt could be in a state of weakness and for what periods.
I think that it will submit.
I'll tell him, said upon leaving the hearing counsel for Ms. Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman.
For his part, counsel for Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, Mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court decision.
This is great news (...) expertise demonstrate that he (Mr. Bani) has handled this old lady that needs protecting, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist touch to everything she accuses of having benefited for years of weak his mother for one billion euros in donations in the form of checks, contracts of life insurance or master paintings.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, considers it a longtime friend.
While the court must consider the admissibility of the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt Meyers, the lawyers' arguments were sometimes turned into a great family unpacking Friday.
Thus, the lawyer Liliane Bettencourt reported on three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his solicitor in which she said was suspicious of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Frances, I could never speak to him since his marriage.
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre has again found that the complainant was not entitled to act, especially as a guardianship judge has refused in recent days to grant his request to open proceedings legal protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to sue, it is not protected and no guardian.
Nobody else has to act in his place, "said the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that he would decide after the trial is held on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt Meyers.
Managerial revolution or the end of the intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our struggle for development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to its employees, said the position of companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to join the staff at "values" determined the top as it was formerly to impose on the consumer products designed by technicians at the plant.
By putting the customer at the heart of business, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquest of markets in place ... although the temptation to impose authoritarian products disconnected factors preferences of customers come back regularly!
A demobilization of employees may lead to demoralization deadly.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much wider phenomenon, affecting in particular settings.
The demobilization and adversely affect the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R & D and, more importantly, of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE "demands that all parties involved (...) a proactive vision and foresight" and it requires from employees is a commitment that revenue management authoritarian contradict completely.
We therefore call for a managerial revolution that would put the employees at the heart of the concerns of the business as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Opinion polls internal-like questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees, they will incite revolution in management practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First, because I saw that face a new situation, the whole structure finally arrives, after many detours, to make this a priority ... it always has. !
- Also because of authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power-increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently revived by the "neuroscience" Americans and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by research institutes and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) the commitment of managers, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr confirms she's leaders in a posture of governance mechanistic , unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure factors mobilization
Instead, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, involves adopting a final vision of human behavior.
It is to incorporate into any argument or governance practice, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it is clearly a means to achieve some of their dreams their ambitions, their plans.
Currently, only studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have demonstrated that they consider their company based on a predetermined doxa which allows them, through their perceived image of the company, evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these factors mobilization, business leaders can monitor, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resource management "in place".
This creates a fertile ground for developing a concerted intelligence robust and efficient.
Speeches Oslo: the "just war" is right to praise Obama
The American right has welcomed Friday's speech yesterday in Oslo by Barack Obama, met the Nobel peace in 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had taunted the award to Mr. Obama October 9, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the vice presidency in 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican party in USA Today, adding she herself broached the subject of war "sometimes necessary" in his memoirs that just been published.
War is obviously the last thing I think that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists down there, "she said.
Mr. Obama, who has inherited two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send additional 30,000 troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had in Oslo "great job".
I found that the speech was really good, welcomed the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which has particularly appreciated the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" about the president.
In some part, I found that speech-to-all historical fact, Mr. Gingrich said, when asked during the radio program "The Takeaway".
Former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for president in 2012, said he was delighted to have seen "a leftist president" to remind the Nobel Committee "that would not be free and could not give a price for peace if the use of force did not exist. "
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush converted to the Washington Post columnist, Mr. Obama delivered a "very American speech".
In addition to appear in "global citizen" as "it always does," he spoke as an American president, "reminding the Europeans that" they live in a bubble of safety they did not create and they do little to preserve it, "said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few right not to be satisfied, a hawk of the Bush era, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "dull, turgid and uninspiring" on the website National Review Online .
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When the war is wrapped in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocents, "he warned.
The press center-left, however, remained Commendation to the Speaker.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel was awarded prematurely Mr. Obama called his remarks "blockbuster" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech Oslo "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," ignited the Daily Californian.
Mr. Obama "gave the speech he had," said the New York Times, claiming it was "both dark and uplifting.

After three sessions of marathon negotiations, trade unions and the road sector TLF, only employers' organization to be stayed until the end, reached late Friday an agreement to end the slogan of the strike threat Christmas supplies.
During the autograph session Friday night, Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, has "welcomed" the agreement, after several rounds of negotiations, which started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators had left at dawn Friday with hopes to sign quickly in the late morning the text of the agreement.

But it took more than six hours meeting began at 11:00 am for everyone to agree and to 18:00 on the text is signed.
The conflict "has been very damaging for businesses" and "it was feared that disrupt the holidays of years," said Bussereau.
The text provides a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in road transport local and regional), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In the hourly rate for low-wage, "it goes from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but from afar, "said Patrice Clos (FP).
Whether it will give orders to our members that there is no blockage, no blockade of supply centers.
But we can still be a few holdouts who are not happy, "he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, hailed "a good deal," even though it was difficult to grant increases on the high salaries given the international competition ".
He said the increases will be around 170 euros a month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.

The agreement also provides for the upgrading of the travel expenses of 3%, and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will particularly address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.

The signing of TLF provides that the agreement applies initially to companies adhering to this organization, and a second time, to any occupation, if extended by the Minister of Labor.
It will be "as soon as possible," assured Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations may only delay the process.
FNTR has denounced a "fool's bargain", as 100 million euros "have already been promised to the sector to help offset the carbon tax.
The Secretary OF State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in l? Emergency, not concluding? Shared analysis, but not thwart the eating of turkey next Christmas Eve, has deplored the Unostra.
For ur the agreement is likely "to dig the grave of? A very large number of SME sector in the next 12 months."
RER A: disruption this weekend, unions unhappy with proposals RATP
Disturbances on the RER A, the largest online urban transit from France, will continue during the weekend, when a meeting Friday at the 2nd day of strike between management and unions of the RATP has left on unsatisfied demand for their premium.
Saturday and Sunday for this important weekend of shopping before Christmas, there will be trains between 10:00 ET 20H00, due to a second train on the central section (between La Defense and Nation) and a train of four outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, awaiting 200,000 customers each day, were pleased that "the RATP make efforts to serve the department stores.
The RER A cross from west to east in the Paris region.
The RATP short stretch of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Leger et Marne-La-Vallee.
Friday, about a second train was circulated to peak, and almost any train in peak hours, as expected.
Since Thursday, there were no crowds on the docks, having organized Ile.
So early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the lack of high school students.
A Boissy St Leger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina engineer 29 years, explained himself up "half past one earlier, to be sure to arrive on time.
The Gare Saint-Lazare has not been saturated, said the station, which had provided guidance to officers and law enforcement.
The A-Train operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Gare Saint-Lazare to join the underground.
Further meetings of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results, considered "scarce" by the unions, meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RSP proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A in all aspects of working time, career etc.
This is not what want drivers who want a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP is even his proposals premium brackets, the CGT was indignant, saying that management "was not damned to solve a problem while in the station road and done."
A further meeting is planned Monday for a "broader review of conditions of practice," said RATP.
What has also told the unions that the company "made fun of users of the weekend.
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded a committee established at headquarters in Paris.
Then the management who previously refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "for the sake of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B Tuesday after the filing of a notice by UNSA and Independents.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (UNSA) EUR 150 EUR including 30 variables (CGT, FOR, CFDT, South Independents) and complain about deteriorating work on this line a million passengers daily.
The RER train drivers, all in second half of their careers, receive from 2,200 to 2.700 euro gross and 600 to 650 euros bonus for staggered hours, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish court dissolved the pro-Kurdish party, a decision fraught with consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court delivered Friday dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country, a move that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in south-east and in Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the task of government, which has to reach out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) has been disbanded because it had become a "hotbed of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," he told reporters the Chief Justice Hasim Kilic , after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to dissolve, Kilic said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its chairman Ahmet Turk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the immunity enjoyed by Mr and Mrs Turk Tugluk and confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that members would leave the Parliament rather than serve as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure introduced in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya, who accuses the DTP to obey the "guidelines" of the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a showcase of Legal Policy PKK rebels.
The party, however, ensures that he has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calling on the government to negotiate with him.
The Court verdict comes as the government is reaching out to the Kurdish community by offering a series of measures to reinforce its rights to try to dry up the support of the Kurds and the PKK to end the conflict.
DTP leaders had said that termination could lead to renewed tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan has degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of Justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered outside the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the South is populated mainly by Kurds.
The police fired teargas and used water cannons, when demonstrators hurled Molotov cocktails and stones with slingshots.
A hundred people demonstrated also in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the decision of Justice was "deepening despair.
Turkey can not solve this issue (Kurdish editor's note) by prohibiting a party, "he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party resulting from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, "said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total of torpedoing the democratic opening launched by the government, "commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction to the PKK, "he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For years she had the reputation of secret city, closed to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of ten districts of Moscow, was under Soviet rule, a place to search for secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216 000 inhabitants 37 km from central Moscow, the town has a reputation as the "Silicon Valley" Soviet.
Major production sites and research in micro-and nanoelectronics are located.
From September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd has established links with Riedberg, instead of Sciences Frankfurt - with academic institutions and companies innovation center in Frankfurt (FIZ).
There have been meetings and reciprocal last Wednesday with representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a "Memorandum of close collaboration."
Signatories were Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Anatoly Smimov prefect of Zelenograd in the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz section chief project for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is research, Zelenograd to leave for a seminar.
Scientific Exchange
It is an exchange of scientific development.
But also economic relations.
It will enable FIZ companies to enter the Russian market expanding.
Unlike corporations Russian scientists seeking contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of institutes and research firms Soviet famous.
It is the Institute of Electrical Engineering from Moscow, the big firms and Sitronics Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The town was founded in 1958 as "socialist city planned" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") derives its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centers are located.
Project S21: a brake Stuttgart
We can not place high enough magnitude of project Stuttgart 21.
To its supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If you want. S21 is more than the burial of a railway station, but a huge construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Wuerttemberg, in a hopeless chaos of sites for a decade .
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 80s.
The head end stations, with tracks that ended in the city, had the reputation at that time to be relics of the transport technology of the nineteenth century were the effect of brake shoe modern rail traffic as it was once a long time to get the locomotive back to front.
Arrival, shortstop, starting - this is what to do.
Therefore the head end stations must disappear in Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart also: a station of trains, which is located approximately midway on the Magistrale Transeuropéenne rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava in the motto "heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really begin, although visions of the 80s are more long-compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Indeed, the head end stations no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, railcars and reversible car-driver on both ends.
However it is now launching the implementation of Stuttgart 21 next to the new alignment of the inter-city line to Ulm.
The regional political and community have prevailed.
The company's railway is part because it is the taxpayer who paid the price risk of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public company.
From the perspective of urban development project is allowed fairly well justified.
This gives an urban space that - if one believes planners graphics generated by computer - will be very green.
For the rail transport system on S21 is negative.
The railway crossing and widening of the section are designed for human trafficking which was attributed - and this is typical of the 80s - a tremendous growth.
At the time there was not competition from cheap flights.
The modern trade policy should first focus on building traffic for freight transport by rail is more environmentally friendly than trucks on the road.
But the new alignment, with its inclinations, not suitable for freight trains.
The S21 and it is much more serious concerns indirectly many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of Swabia.
This is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion is more realistic.
One thing is for sure in the next decade that money to fail other junctions and bottlenecks in the network.
The list of Department of Transportation says in all sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the Rhine Valley 180 good miles.
Since 1987 this line is built slowly.
It is really urgent support by building on the fungus.
But the S21 project had the effect of a braking device.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of traffic of goods internationally and in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the ruling on the airport
At the regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the state government has raised the possibility of appealing the decision of the Administrative Court of Hesse on the ban of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU / FDP had appointed experts to examine the legal point of view the ruling by the Administrative Tribunal and is a document containing over 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel was justified in a written document that the state should adjust the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in case the project of building the airstrip north-west of Frankfurt airport would be realized .
The authorization for 17 had landed between 23h and 5 am, as envisaged by the state government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air pollution at night.
The coalition must have decided to January 4 if it wishes to make an appeal against the ruling.
Opposition criticism that period and attempts to pressure the government representative for it cirenonce to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and FDP to return to their promise before the elections and that was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will CONSIDERATION like a total failure at a given word.
It's damn hard to be allowed to keep his word, "said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's election slogan" We keep our promises. "
Dieter Posch Minister refutes criticism of Schäfer-Gümbel claiming that the state government is trying to still allow night flights by using "of pettifoggery and cunning".
It takes time to make a specific legal review.
The coalition does not take a decision on the basis of a "quick first impression."
It is necessary that the decision is legally secure, "said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the part of his statements on the ban of night flights is completely erroneous.
U.S. banks repay the aid granted
Large U.S. banks, heavily affected by the crisis, shedding their relationship vis-à-vis the state.
Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $ 45 billion (over 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the bailout Tarp.
The U.S. television network CNBC reported that in a report that Citigroup is also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions are seeking to get rid of the restrictions that accompany the acceptance of money, such as limiting the bonus awarded to the leader and the regulation of higher costs.
The Bank of Americae launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors who reported 19 billion dollars of new money.
The rest of the money comes from funds of the bank are met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis CEO of Bank of America held specifically to thank the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has helped considerably to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had overestimated his capabilities by acquiring the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup also plans to raise money on capital markets to free themselves from the tutelage of the state.
The U.S. bank could open as soon as Thursday a capital increase of $ 20 billion, CNBC reported, citing the banking community.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not want to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Election accelerated
Finally everything has still spent more quickly than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current holding the post of editor in chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already named.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey who directs the writing of ZDF Berlin was the favorite.
The chain has not wished to be confirmed - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the desire not to further impair the Intendant of ZDF, Markus Schächter if the proposal is not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is the candidate Schächter, needed the vote of 9 members to 14.
A vote was not known at the end of writing this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schacht had proposed to the Board to extend the five-year contract Nikolaus Brender but it was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had supported the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against. The impeachment vote by Brender was a bitter failure, although predictable Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which has a majority in the Board had suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to renew his post Brender.
It's Roland Koch, Minister President of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor.
He denied that the contract's esteemed editor in chief be extended by invoking the fact that the rate of listening to news broadcasts from the ZDF had fallen below Brender.
That is why the protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, condemning the growing political influence exerted on ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and felt that the way to act Koch was unconstitutional.
But this is for nothing.
Peter Frey: Who is it?
Peter Frey was born August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy andthe Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at Südwestfunk (body radio Rhineland-Palatinate) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German newspaper of national scope).
In 1983 he became editor in ZDF first to the news magazine "heute journal" (newspaper today).
Then the journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was deputy editor-in-chief at the time, then Washington correspondent in 1991/1992, and then until 1998 he was chief and presenter of "Morgenmagazin" (bi-monthly news program presented in the morning) until 2001 he was head of foreign policy and ZDF chief editorial Berlin.
After the disgrace of Brender, while it had just been elected Journalist of the Year by the magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent to the Board, the Minister President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Treaty Intergovernmental ZDF so that proposals for the steward staff can not not be blocked by a political majority sided.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of members of political committees to monitor the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor Brender had deftly maneuvered to the Board of Directors by criticizing the committee vehemently in his decision to sack Brender.
With this evidence of journalistic independence, Schacht was able to propose for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, as the Board of Directors could be elected without being suspected of placing in a post-partisan politics.
In the arithmetic of party representation, Frey is ranked liberal left.
Major cleanup in the university
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory at a meeting between the Ministers and delegates of the Conference of Rectors, agreement was developed stating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They are especially made to accordpour lighten the weight of tests: a single must enable close study of the module chosen.
In addition, the workload will be reconsidée to ensure "realistic proportions and acceptable".
The political authorities and institutions of higher education wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also agreed to organize joint structural requirements for more flexible courses of Bachelor and Master.
At regional level, it should not be any different regulations from state to another.
Under examination
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have always mouth the buzzword: "étudiabilité.
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain tests: Each module should normally be concluded by a single examination, "it said in a document of some thirty pages on the future admission the graduate university.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board said that significantly reducing the burden of examinations should be able to stop the slippage, which interfered significantly with étudiabilité.
The "étudiabilité" should additionally be in the future, the decisive test of organizational studies.
Modules like the background must be examined carefully to see if we can not avoid the feeling of suffocation that one sometimes experiences in choosing courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - The latest knowledge on RAID Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and flexibility necessary to enable and encourage personal initiative."
The new regulations concerning access to new university courses but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "re-accreditation" every 5 years, which means, however, that it was not until 2015 that all cycles have been examined.
There are 10 relevant accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory dependent Accreditation Board established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on agencies to ensure that programs are not overloaded and the examination system not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional departments to take appropriate action.
Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only state to have agreed to allocate more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities should organize programs tutorielset strengthen educational guidance offices and the offices of examinations and the International Relations Department
The Länder and universities that provide for a budget of 10 million euros.
Beginning 2010, the Government wishes to submit to Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
After that it will spend more than one exam to complete his studies.
The organization studies should be more flexible, more must be assured recognition of transcripts from other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "étudiabilité" from all levels of the university will be considered.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have once again discussed the issue of study conditions in the country.
The décisionsont been appreciated but critics have been heard.
The Federal President of the Socialist Union of Students said he would like the organization of educational policy happens in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and rectors of universities.
At the latest after the strike educational students as individuals concerned should be able to speak a little.
Future graduates of higher education they received support from President Commissioner of the Rectors' Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the student experience is very useful," she said Thursday during a meeting with Ministers of Education of the Länder with which HRK working on a joint project of reform.
For the Union of Education and Science (GEW) decisions taken in Bonn did not go far enough. He claims the right and opportunity for each Bachelor degree to enroll in a cycle master.
Andreas Keller board member of GEW also requests that the Länder provide students Bachelor of today, tomorrow there will be enough places for Master studies and study conditions as good as possible.
The Länder must hire more lecturers.
For cons, the Ministers of Education have raised the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on page Herta Müller
With these words, "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost no supervision ... "Begins a work of poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematized in snatches of sentences disturbing experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany has gained freedom but lost at the same time his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, series editor in a publishing company for the youth before settling Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has received several literary awards and in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry of Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he is director of Forum for Literature in Hesse's house artist Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He did a lot about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday at a conference in Munich, whose theme was "The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your folders Securitate.
Visibly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he admitted to his fellow writers Germano-Romanian as Richard Wagner, William Totok Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer he had worked as an informer for the Securitate secret police.
Söllner received in 1989 the price of the German language together with other participants.
The tests had begun insidiously enlistment in 1971.
I am Söllner concludes "So someone who has not sufficiently able to resist intimidation auxessais Securitate.
The poet is Werner Söllner informant Walter (Walter IM).
Almost simultaneously with the honorable Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his quarrels with literary pieces mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene was shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, a case which clearly shows the depths and the meanness of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also the victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, provides specialist literature Michael Markel after confession Söllner and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter, who had interceded on his behalf.
"He had drawn out of difficult situations all the time," according to Markel.
Markel has felt the need moralde to this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, but the confession of a former dissident of its collaboration with the Romanian secret service is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a nice reserve for the Securitate spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of his own record.
Presumably, the victims have been speculations and will sometimes guess what the actual names were hiding last names borrowing Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where the time between the consultation files of the Stasi is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic explanation has been repeatedly thwarted and hindered in the past.
It was not until 1999 that a national council to match the institution Birthler has been created to work on the assimilation of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) but the return of records has been dragged instead.
It exists since 2005 a law that defines records management.
The influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, is confirmed by an interview with a former head of the Securitate Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Herta Müller spoke in a very contemptuous towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and ultimately no one had questioned only once.
The infamy of power thought to be expressed here, without any gene under the guise of freedom of expression.
While many issues are inevitable if associated Söllner as happens so often in the context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who was robbed? The reaction Weighted listeners, the admission of Söllner, gave hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge by accusations and shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize is more than a footnote on page.
Turmoil in the Champions League
We felt that a representative arrived there, all dressed up straight from a Christmas party fun, which the manufacturer of sport had spread his wares when the new coach Christian Gross VFB went to midnight least one quarter in a Mercedes C class, he had just called an orange plastic bag supplier to the hand.
The man, whose bald head drew attention, to be led in the city he was still foreign.
Otherwise our fifties could itself take the wheel - he had not drunk alcohol and he was not drunk with happiness.
He had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow it should return to work.
For it now that it would begin.
The words of Switzerland that it had hired three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the knockout round, ie in the Champions League thanks to our 3: 1 cons of Unirea Urziceni Romania "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. This will be a brutal fight to avoid falling.
The "big job" ahead Sunday.
There he is again in Mainz results of the Champions League every day.
And he will overcome the weaknesses that surfaced after the three goals of expeditious Marica (5.) Träsch (8.) And Pogrebnyak (11.)
Draw
The eighth-finals of the Champions League (first leg 16./17. + 23./24 February / leg 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on the 18th. December in Nyon.
The joy of the inauguration of the successor of fulminant Babbel was so moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate in those who had much luck, which was sent to professionals Stuttgart destabilized, an unfailing motivation and pleasure to play.
I went to see the players and told them they needed to focus on their strengths, I have advised them to be more courageous, "explained the" plumber's souls "- Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so bienmais who did most effect with the trainer Babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic, "confessed Jens Lehmann - supporter Babbel -" in the foot when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things you never thought possible.
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks break for injury, advanced to the rank of best player thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed by the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "C is someone who takes action and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation. "
But Babbel had apparently failed.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet turned the corner, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart especially need tenacity.
Like Gross, players and managers are careful not to overstate the victory against a defense totally outdated and weak Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having four days later a bad alarm clock with Leverkusen 0:4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, manager, reported that they had reached a goal of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
Heldt that the day of his 40th birthday did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home win for three months, the events of the weekend television interview that goalkeeper Jens Lehmann made bouncing just before the start of the match.
There are other decisions that are not Jens, thwarted Heldt, in response to harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He was accused of weak leadership style and said she had decided to change coaches under pressure from fans puberty.
Lehmann was also considered as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele that his day off after the games it has been deleted.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness" and drove Heldt told the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were more likely to become lifelong friends both forties.
In any cast, they agreed to everything else, ie without the preliminary work of the group by the coach replaced the high performance sports and fighting would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have been "largely successful in" retorted Heldt and Lehmann in chorus - and even the plastic bag man nodded.
Championship heavyweight
Hot Fight in Bern: the challenger Kevin Johnson continually provoked verbal and gestural world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve hard rounds the Ukrainian defended his title as world champion heavy weight from the version of the federation WBC.
A unanimous decision he made it on points.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko retained his title as world champion heavy weight.
The WBC federation announced that on the night of Saturday the champion of 38 years had won a victory points to unaminité judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honor since her comeback on stage in October 2008.
Earlier, the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion federations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately he failed the KO as expected.
Klitschko, left 39-time winner in 41 professional fights, had to admit twice its defeat because of injury.
The challenger of accepting Johnson's first defeat at the 24th fight.
In the Arena in Bern, before 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko especially wanted to dictate the fight, down from its 2.02 meters, its cons left.
Johnson, eleven inches smaller that before the duel, had announced the end of the era Klitschko managed to avoid the blows of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko to bring into play its cons right dangerous.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has mostly tried to go rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko in words and actions did not reach its shots rarely championed.
It is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having passed with Klitschko distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko, calling him a "nasty zombie" who "is not really capable".
During the weighing Friday, the champion could not help but provoke Johnson making him drop his sunglasses nose "in order to see his eyes."
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko has emerged again in his fourth fight since his comeback October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten the then Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without a fight.
This year, defending his championship, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and September against Chris Arreola U.S..
"I just took a blow in this fight and am in perfect shape," Klitschko said in explaining his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to unite the family in the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is Champion WBO and IBF federations.
But the UK is David Hague, who dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, is the WBA belt.
This summer, Hague had canceled a match against Vitali Klitschko, which was scheduled for September.
It seems that his development company is planning to play this game at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: the parliamentary leader of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, has accused the Minister of Defense Guttenberg lie in the case of In re Kunduz.
The parties SPD and the Left Party (Die Linke) asked the Chancellor of explanations.
Hamburg / Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on air attack in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally "made untrue" on the deadly strikes of two trucks in September, said the parliamentary leader of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the news program of the ARD " Tagesschau "(The Journal of 20h).
Clearly, it means that he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the ISAF security in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is essentially the contents of the report available to NATO and was read by Mr. Guttenberg said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of lafrappe was actually not to destroy the stolen truck, but was good to eliminate two key Taliban leaders.
According to the investigation report of NATO, 142 people had been killed or injured during the air attack had been launched at the request of Colonel German Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to rule as soon as possible before the federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast believe that Ms. Angela Merkel should make it clear whether the strategy of targeted killings is part of the policy of the Afghan Government fédéralet whether the chancery, the army and intelligence services have endorsed this new strategy.
The spokesman of the Government categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancery has in no way influenced the military interventions in Afghanistan, "he said.
Saturday, voices were increasingly strong to express the real reasons doutesquant referral of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as it had been presented by the Department.
According to information from SPIEGEL log the information they had submitted to Guttenberg attack on tankers were both correct and complete.
Officially, they have concealed the existence of NATO report to the Minister and concealed some embarrassing details.
In the entourage of two senior officials are suggesting, however, they have informed the Ministry of Defense of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that would Wichert meantime requested in a letter clarifying the facts.
So far it has not been answered
On Saturday, the Ministry declined to comment on these allegations and referred to the Committee of Inquiry of the Federal Parliament was going to be the following Wednesday dapporter to clarify the facts in question.
The worlds of dreams
Some are wide awake, images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears.
Not only among mentally ill or under the influence of drugs, the boundaries between fantasy and reality merge.
Until these events occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we're lying in darkened rooms, we can give ourselves unfettered dreams and wildest fantasies.
But one who, awake, had the experience of dream state, hears and sees things that others do not, soon the reputation in our Western world to be mad or drugged, or at least be an original.
Such images and voices that do not appear among mentally ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is involved: the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but that sometimes leads the boundaries between dreams, madness and reality to melt.
A state of conscious awareness, in the form of a dream can come under the most diverse forms, in the best case it is called visions, the worst of the madness.
But even if the trigger and effect are distinct, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychosis and hallucinations are due to process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of neurotransmitter substances in the brain - first and foremost dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achétylcholine - is broken and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions occur very often for schizophrenic psychosis.
The strength of Earth's gravity has more power over the individual.
Since antiquity, philosophers and physicians have always looked at the relationship between madness and dreams.
For Aristotle, the hallucinations were a form of dream-awake Wilhelm Griesinger, a founder of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and dreams, to Sigmund Freud the dream was even" a psychosis all irregularities, fantasies, delusions and delusions which consists ".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T becomes a character in a cartoon.
His body is in two dimensions gaudy.
The Earth's gravity has more power over him, he hangs flush with the ceiling.
He felt a sudden.
Behind him the devil winged creatures, grimacing, mouth bloodied, showing teeth.
They pursued him, give him kicking with heavy boots flamboyant, throw it against the walls, he felt pain throughout the body.
The thundering voice, nasty, screaming, leaving the walls and the radio.
He can not bear these voices that insult and humiliate.
Henning T. snatches two cables of its stereo, makes a loop and attaches to a hook in the ceiling.
He mounts a speaker and passing the loop around the neck.
He jumps.
The loop stands.
Let this be a lesson, "cried the voice in a chorus to snatch the eardrum. "Go to a clinic and let yourself heal!"
Today Henning T. 40 years, he spent six acute psychosis, the last 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, he is also manic-depressive, he is taking medication against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis of fear I experienced terrible and profound despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
One per cent of the population suffers at least once in his life of schizophrenia in clinical psychiatric illness is most common after the Depression.
In a fit of schizophrenia, those concerned can no longer tell the difference between the inner world and outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper arousal, which they may suffer hallucinations, grandiosity, of madness relational or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices - voices that command, that comment or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person can not distinguish between important and unimportant, the brain can not filter out interference signals, consciousness is embedded in the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the floodgates to a tide of ideas and fantasies outcome of deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the topic, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry of the University Hospital of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is located in the heart of the situation, a service focused on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like a dream, overcome by events and can not act on them actively.
That is why people with schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they are not able to adjust reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
To experience a once in a lifetime of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is seen during the psychosis is basically preserved.
The thoughts and hallucinations, delusions are based on reality, the alienation of living takes place in a real context.
Why is our brain doing what kind of antics, is still an enigma to researchers.
Exceptional situations can bring everyone to momentarily lose perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only factors.
The researchers assume that people are concerned with minimal brain damage.
Assume that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, "says Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the neural system fault occurs and also that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or a traumatic experience can trigger psychosis, however, if there is predisposition.
Similarly hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats.
This is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that their suffering psychotic hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of while others buy drugs for them dearly available.
The perception of pleasant or unpleasant dreams is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings ten years of reporting hallucinations and illusory phenomena of images: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "The unreal world in our heads."
Hallucinations are one of many concurrent phenomena typical of psychosis but also an impressive number of other disorders.
Among them are mental disorders such as depression or borderline but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or brain injury.
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people is prone to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, by Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They are formed when areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained, when our brain heats but also when there is lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, heartaches or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledged having done at least once in a lifetime experience of a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. At 16, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and she goes to school.
A girl just be normal actually.
If it were not for images and voices.
During the break, sometimes a young boy, slim, with long brown hair, spoke to him.
When she meets her friends look on, amazed - no one else sees or hears the boy.
They think this girl is a shy dreamer Sarah K whimsical but not dreaming, it is certain.
She is awake, hears and sees the boy as she sees and hears the girl who sits beside her on the bench.
She can even collect their presence temporarily.
It feels good, she found that young friendly.
Am I mad? Wonders does sometimes.
But she knows that the young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appearances are generally appalling.
Visions are often cumbersome.
When she is in class, sometimes it can take the course because the professor is just putting forward a new student in his eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and that the teacher is visibly trying to explain the equations on the blackboard.
The night appearances are generally appalling.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too infrequently and too late, she often can not distinguish if it is already dreaming or awake, if the images she sees, the distorted faces or the girl with bloody gashes on his arms and legs are in front of his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she cries to these creatures.
She did not speak nor his parents nor his friends, they would take a lunatic.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. 20 years today.
She took her exams last year and she lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations ceased.
Since it came into contact via Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows she is not crazy.
Madness is also a masterpiece of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or not enough stimulation, the probability is great that he had hallucinations after a while.
I suppose that the brain is not busy enough, made sure that there is any animation.
Sarah K., only daughter was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when she learned at age 13, the man she called dad since she was old enough to think, not his real father.
These are the same brain areas are active for acoustic and visual hallucinations, and impressions and sounds real, it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between illusion and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten "occurs in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, nocturnal dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people does not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
Therefore Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on my conscience was quickly unfortunately tend to take the experience for imaginary diseases, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and Medical Officer of Clinical Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale Hospital Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful but also contains something positive, creative - the madness is a masterpiece of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied form of experience itself oniroïde a particular form of modification of consciousness awakened by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are semi-complex dreams that are perceived as real by those who live and he can not distinguish the dream even while awake.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during trauma or in situations of extreme conditions as for patients who Polyradiculopathy fully conscious, experience of motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard when a human being is threatened by loss of self and the world, due to an inability to move and sustainable, it replaces the actual situation that affects his life, his own imaginary world which is separated reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world of change takes place but the actual situation is represented in the imagination.
This is actually a severe form of means and performing in a situation so intolerable an organizational capacity that is given to us men, not sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book "Change of heart" as an action to safeguard the soul.
He has 49 years, when the conscious part to a journey of several days after the operation followed a heart valve transplant, during which time his body is doomed to remain motionless in the ICU.
Claussen immersed in a world he has created from scratch, visit foreign places, time travel. He sees himself as an old man in bed in a sanatorium railway, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in middle age among the nobles who manufacture drugs based on blood.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorbike which takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the firn in the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It completely absorbed in this fantasy world, everything is real even later in his memoirs.
According to Claussen these domestic travel is fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream state is quite different, "he wrote describing his experiences.
Instead of dreams, memories from Travel mental are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
One can even say they are much more distinct and more intensive than the lived reality.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to Schmidt-Degenhard psychiatrist.
Ultimately, oniroïdes delusions, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how our internal representations of external reality are fragile even in wakefulness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snows may fall
Burda
At age 27, children will follow up the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of the Burda publishing is an intermediate solution in the longer term, Hubert Burda hopes that his two children take the media group, "he told the newspaper Der Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
Both children inherit at age 27 and are firmly committed to joining the company, said Hubert Burda, 69 years at Spiegel.
Every detail has been paid in advance.
The question of whether they are active in the company arise thereafter.
It will also see if they are able.
We can not require its employees to 7,500 children without knowing if they have the capacity to deal with it.
It would demolish the children as well as the business.
Burda was informed last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the position President and CEO since January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, is a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
It was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he took care of the Treasury sector ie he was responsible for the company's stock and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the head of marketing, foreign sector, printing and Finance.
So for the first time this is not a family member who is head of the Burda publishing.
Burda children were respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix, who would now be 42 years, died a few years ago.
The nomination of Kallen also serves to link the 10 or 15 years "
Burda said that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in families that have left cause by a surfeit of capital which have made enormous speculation unhappy, thinking they could climb even higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I've never had rêvede universal power, said Burda.
I absolutely do not see myself in the role of tutor to the country as could be the Springer and I do not intend to be part of the international leagues such as Time, these companies have taken much too seriously.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device which allows only to watch his email, without the opportunity even to see what type of attachments or surf the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of fame in the United States, where Time magazine named one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what it costs, for example, subscription data of the iPhone.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, one with a free data for life, six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is just as limited as its big brother U.S., but has a surprise.
The price of monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming across Europe.
Those traveling with a Smartphone already know what is done to give the data when you cross a border or desperately seeking a cafeteria on the WiFi (or Fon connection) so check his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is long it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but in my case, I need to have done a PhD in physics to understand and good glasses to read the fine print.
The calls to order repeated the European Commission to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely perceptible.
Outside his home country, one hesitates to use the data, and it was not wrong.
A small device like FonPeek (he is always curious that when he called Fon does not have Wi-Fi) offer such rates, means that operators begin to think differently and are studying various proposals for their return on their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the download of books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and without galley.
It is a device connected and you pay when purchased, not each month.
And that's what I hope one day to the FonPeek: a call option with access to life like the Peek has been the United States.
Not that I want to buy.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a more fair for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The favorite color of Michelle
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the taking office of Barack Obama for President of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, it has indeed chosen the same to accompany the second time without No doubt, the most important of his life: the presentation in Oslo Nobel Peace.
Michelle Obama wore a model very similar on both occasions: In addition to color likeness, a yellow green with bright reflections, both times, the holding consisted of three parts: the dress, jacket and coat in the same tissue, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So as a first glance, it seems that the first lady of the United States follow the wake of the Princess of Asturias and chose to put the same outfit.
But the tissue in which are carved two sets makes them very different.
If for taking office he was a thick lace, however, she wore a velvet printed Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heel for the first time, and a similar model, but gold, this time.
The salon also has changed: the hair is now identified when it was released the last time.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for younger generations of women who want to be mothers.
This study reveals that "Fertility and careers of women in Spain", performed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9 737 women aged 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their careers limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the early life couple and the number of children if the woman works or not and the type of job.
Those that do not work outside the home, work part time or have unstable work, begin as soon as a couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable employment, primarily in the public sector, the push into the living couple and the first pregnancy and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years with a regular job have their first child on average 3.7 years after being installed as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives to obtain, which has led to reject the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment influence largely motherhood, but unless the start date of cohabitation, "says researcher CSIC Margarita Delgado.
Educational attainment is another factor that widens the gap in age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the higher they get married and have their first child later.
The difference remains also among the women of a generation.
For example, in the group aged between 35 and 49 years, those who have studied elementary and higher, respectively, were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another distinctness is also between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have conducted studies elementary marry and have their first child before finding steady employment, those who studied at intermediate or higher reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child, "said Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth
L'Oreal Paris has added a new name to its list of ambassadors envied: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will play the image of many brand products, intoning the universal motto "Because I'm worth it."

Among men, the cosmetic brand ambassadors also has luxury: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Gray, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in Lost).
Prices of British fashion

Poker Ace Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers in Poquer of ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) thirty "rays" of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not predictable by gender and large (short biography, life and work), but seeking something similar to the ignition kernel of the character created.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither fears nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an invitation to exciting reading and rereading.

A cowardly attack
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years, was walking in our neighborhood of the town of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside her and our dog, a mixed-blood , saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six pounds, and without saying a word, they would assenèrent two kicks that left a dog badly injured.
Our anger is great because we do not see what yad'amusant free to attack a defenseless little animal which, moreover, was on a leash.
Added to this outrage of a lady who was walking slowly and when she insulted these individuals came to fear for his physical integrity, since a madman that attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, child, old or, ultimately, anyone weaker than himself.
The episode took place about 17 hours on a Tuesday as another in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog whined all day.
Of course, we complained to the local police although we doubt that it used to much and not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly assassins were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to find fun free mistreat defenseless animals who gives us love, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know what happened to good manners and respect for animals and people.
Michelin Fesvial, sets for helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage helmet use, especially among younger riders, as reported today the two structures .
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, it is the only element of protection to prevent head injuries or even death in case of accident two wheels.
Michelin said the campaign was part of the lineage commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of products that are safer" and said it contributes to this objective of other actions that are educational and informative.
This new campaign promoting helmet use two wheels under the motto "To Be or Not to Be", will include an initial phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin said that road safety is "a concern" for the company because as a manufacturer of tires for vehicles with two wheels, one of its main objectives is to develop products that are safer.
Sales of light commercial vehicles rose
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represents an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers' association ANFAC manufacturers and Ganvam, the concessionaires.
It should however be qualified good news, because the reference used for comparison, the month of November 2008 was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% over the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound last month, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of last year.
Since January, if we add all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pickups, vans, light vans and light trucks chassis) 95 853 were sold.
The dark clouds that most affect their application did not mean dissipated. Indeed, although they are also bought by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium businesses, who pay almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by limiting bank loans, we must add other factors such as higher unemployment rate or the persistence of poor economic conditions.
Faced with this situation and unlike cars, aid for the purchase of 2000E were little used.
In addition to individuals, freelancers and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, can also benefit, but the number of 'operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday at Ganvam we remembered again the need for government to attach special attention to these vehicles and also for commercial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealer association provides year 2010 similar to the ends for which it calculates a drop in sales (passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Assistance Emergency Brake is now mandatory
As has occurred with the antilock brakes and ABS as it takes place with the ESP stability control systems, brake assist emergency will be a mandatory feature on European cars.
They are already mandatory on cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of a vehicle waiting period was set to end in February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it may also help prevent many rear shocks.
Brake Assist emergency works by increasing the pressure on the brakes in an emergency detected by the system with the kick given by the driver.
But it still does not maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, one third of drivers involved in an accident could not press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited full force.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of aid, however, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such items until 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be prevented each year.
This reduction would be even bigger with the popularization of so-called intelligent systems Emergency braking: it calculates that a loss of four with injuries would be avoided.
In this case the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera detects obstacles and warns the driver to act more gently on the brakes.
If the driver responds, it helps in increasing pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If he does not respond, and although the collision was inevitable, the device carries a maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors pushes the plan until January for Opel
While workers in the Opel plant Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe that the production of the new Meriva will be launched during the first week of April - probably 8 -, according to Javier Ortega, the U.S. manufacturer has warned it will need more time to conclude the relief plan Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, means that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and the governments of countries where the plants, be postponed until early 2010.
In contrast, at GM, we are assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the U.S. manufacturer so that a decision quickly.
GM admits being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidature of Holland manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converge, becomes important.
Where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab in the Chinese company Baiúca.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In designing their last and precious jewel, Porsche engineers have gone to the Boxster S and has managed to slim that anything less than 80 pounds, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kg.
This has led to happen, first, the roof system was replaced by a manual sheeted roof, to reduce 21 kilos, to employ aluminum doors such as the GT3, another 15 pounds less, to remove the air, 13 pounds, reducing the gas tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos gained, climbing sport bucket, another 12 kilos, and tires with lightweight 19-inch, five pounds.
Finally, they abandoned the audio CDR-30, gaining six kilograms and were replaced by poignéesdes door handles tissue, saving the remaining kilogram.
Although the model is also available with the box PDK dual clutch, the test was conducted on a model with manual six-speed, mostly on secondary roads in California, mountain, especially with tortuous bends.
Its behavior can be described as impeccable.
The decrease of weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it was long since we had not tested a model as small and light, at the same time, ensures safety in all corners, including high speed.
It is a little athlete, capable of heating its musclesà low speed during the time until we asked him to sprint, slow to recover and grow again the engine ...
This out what we wanted. Through his leadership, also commonly said that the car will do what is stated our hands on the wheel.
And she does it with surgical precision.
Its engine will
The sound of their boxer V6 with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the optional "sport" or through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera .
The acceleration is brutal, whether stationary or in recovery.
The suspension is firm but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The pavement that we traveled with Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car has managed the potholes.
The PDAs barely made an appearance all the way, while some turns we found the early morning ice and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultra-lightweight car, the most fun to drive and is much more than a change in the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.
"Bag Girl

The Baskonia offered a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral has received a resounding triumph at 91-82 during his visit to the difficult terrain of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences which affected the team Duško Ivanović. It is well ahead of his group, after the grand spectacle of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight three-point baskets was the best of his team (29 score).
The team from Vitoria has filled the absence of significant Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas Míčov or a great deal of commitment and teamwork, even if she had to wait until the end to win.
Moreover, the great ability from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets scored, largely determines the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blue and red, which took the advantage early on.
The fact that the first four baskets of the team Vitoria are marked from the perimeter, foreshadowed they jumped on the ground with Israeli wrists warm.
Teletovic english and were the main architects of the first 18-20 final quarter.
The second-quarter was the same tone, but the team chose Alava Inner Game of Barak and the work of Eliyahu, who was received with cheers and applause back at his former home, increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic already beginning to be noticed as the best player on his team with 13 runs scored, while the "minus six" Evaluation of Splitter hinted that this night would not be the best in Brazil.
But in this match, despite the fact they were on track to break, nothing was played, far away, and the team Avala wanted to remind those of Vitoria that does not win if easily on their land, and with "the hand of Elias, they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnina contributed significantly to that yellow take advantage of the light (50-49).
Other problems
The players Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed to bind some shares entitled to take the air, and this is when the gun that emerged from Mirza Teletovic who, with three three-point baskets consecutive using Français Ribas and put the counter into a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises were able to increase at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala team went to play all out in the last period and Français and San Emeterio (60-75) avisèrent person that they would tire them take what they had earned during the first thirty minutes.
However, there Pnina Eidson, the best in their team, not resigned and tried to sustain since the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter removed for misconduct, the players rushed Ivanovic does not defended well, and although the Israelis have decreased in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped to Tel Aviv for the first time this season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja battle
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and he has given top of Group B of Euroleague, in a match marked by the absence of the Sunderland players, especially in the indoor game (Freeland Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship by either the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game's first quarter, helped make the dream of Andalusia. An aggressive defense and three baskets on three straight points, two behind leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who has dazzled the home team 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos has been surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the game inside Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, has helped to reverse the score 22-20 at the thirteenth minute , when an action, an early battle between the North American leaders and Beverley Williams led to the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team has begun to operate by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit wound of the pivot Joel Freeland English and three personal fouls by Carlos Jimenez weighed on Unicaja.
The domestic players and forward Linas Kleiza of Lithuania, with their three-point baskets, dug the advantage 44-32 at the nineteenth minute.
One can not lift
The third period was particularly offensive to Olympiacos, who despite 19 losses, showed higher and even came to equal the difference of the disputed meeting in Malaga 66-48, the twenty-seventh minute, making the tottering group head .
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the final exit of the central Scottish Robert Archibald, who was injured during the encounter.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, through his organization, the three-point baskets by Cook, and support of Lewis, gave some hope with 66-57 at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because Olympiacos showed himself implacable when players were lobbying and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The pivot Croatian Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62 at the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.

Brazil set a date for the start of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The ousted president should abandon the diplomatic legation later than January 27, 2010, when the official end of his mandate.
Catunda Francisco, Charge d'Affaires of the Embassy of Brazil in the capital of Honduras, has confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he is a refugee from September 21 before that date .
"He must realize that from January 27, at the end of his mandate, he must look for another destination.
The channel also quoted former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline established: "My position is to start as soon as possible, consistently with the support of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by phone.
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya has ensured he would stay in the Embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed because Zelaya has refused the condition of political exile heard by imposing the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After days roses since last spring, during which the asset inflation has been the dominant note in the markets, uncertainty will arise again, which is not surprising since it is their state natural environments in which agents make decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize the debt by buying assets directly and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to be mobilized.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been virtually completed, and without jeopardizing their political maverick liquidity begin to put some sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award within one year next week.
Therefore, investors doubted the ability of the global economy to sustain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are now seeing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
The volatility of stock exchanges and bond spreads for firms to increase again, although they remain far apart paranormal levels they have reached the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize the private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is a new flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were selected shelters by investors, provoking an increase in differences between countries in the euro area and Germany.
Spain has been barely touched by that episode of instability, but after Standard & Poor's threatened a new downward revision of the classification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not bad to silence defenders of moral hazard, trying again to cause a case of conscience in lesresponsables of global economic policy that had hampered the destructive effects of derivatives limiting the credit to the destruction of jobs, while it should do is declare a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is like a battle between tribal sheikhs to give up his power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a deficit, elections and a new government discovered the scam.
Prodi said Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be quite irrational that the Ecofin saved Hungary from a breach of its external payments earlier this year and allows a member country of the euro area does not meet its commitments.
What makes sense for cons is that the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government transparency and make its citizens share responsibility for the need of extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums transition after some excess in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as our differences in public debt grow to the extent of European corporate bonds, nousn'avons not to worry.
If gaps and Europe declined as ours continue to increase, this would be a risk idiosyncratic Spanish.
The case Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our predictors require most research services to anticipate their patterns of recovery and to revise upward their forecasts for 2011, plus the OECD and the European Commission, returning to the charge with a Japanese model forthe 'Spanish economy, it does not bode much hope for their warning.
Again, this all seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets in Spain, although for the moment "it is better security."
Sectors connected
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, which is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán has outlined to the press that he spoke to the sub-committee in camera.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros by 2020 and 60 000 million more between then and 2030, where nuclear power plants now in operation would remain open.
If this is not the case, the investment necessary do not amount to 60 000 million but 95 000.
By cons, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but the distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question changes, and it will increase power.
His challenge focuses on both gas plants to coal, with mechanisms for recovering carbon dioxide and especially on renewable energy.
In this area, he believes that 18 000 MW more are needed, with other "energy support.
Galan, who believes that the Bill of sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with claims that his company did not wish to attack the royal decree to promote consumption of domestic coal, which contradicts the policies against global warming.
He said there is "a strong bet in the long term in this sense, despite the measures" point ", has qualified as the president of Iberdrola.
Anyway, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are long term, must begin to be taken, because they take time before reaching maturity and that a framework stable pay is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the handling market in Aer Lingus in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for the airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline, Aer Lingus, for freight services in ten European airports where it operates.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms were not disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a memorandum of cooperation to create the Innovation Center of intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance includes an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will conduct research on energy efficiency on the highways and airports.
Acciona is playing his first highway in Australia and Hochtief to Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first highway concession in Australia, a market where it already works as a business manager of energy and water.
The construction involved a tunnel is estimated at 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million).
The French firm Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are his rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometers long in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast, this is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as the undertaking of public works and highway concessionaire.
The mayor of the city wants to have power in late 2014.
After choosing the public-private partnership (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project within a business plan under the tutelage of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to EUR 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia competing with one significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth, and his associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest manufacturers in Australia, while the second, located in Italy, is a leading European specialists in underground work.
Cons team Acciona, is fighting the Northern Consortium Direct, with the presence of the British firm Laing O'Rourke, manager of the Australian infrastructure group Transfield and French builder Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn provides for the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company that specializes in public works, Razel.
The Australian market infrastructure promises of major projects and privatizations, but enter it represents a great difficulty, if not through acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy pursued by companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and remains a milestone not validated for Spanish giants in the industry.
ACS has just won a place on this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, which owns Leighton.
Asset Millionaires
Acciona put on a geographical area of the utmost importance to the sector, which it already has a large presence through his work as an energy supplier and in the field of desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, one of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible to erect and manage the water maker in Adelaide, with a budget of 700 million .
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the markets for construction and infrastructure management.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Office of Infrastructure of the City of Brisbane and that Northern Link (north) is called to connect the highway west Toowong to the ring road at Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometers of tunnel. It is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the auction will be held during the summer of 2010 and that work will start in December next year.
Despite the fact that the toll road will be open to traffic late 2014, it is not anticipated that the construction be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It includes dual carriageway, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane already has work to Hochtief
Australia continues to grow largely Hochtief, which said yesterday getting a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The firm owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, network infrastructure national broadband fiber optics.
This intervention will help 400 000 people have quick access to the Internet and provide jobs to the German company for 18 months.
Moreover, the company sold the project to build the King George Tower, 27 floors in the city of Brisbane. Work has not started yet and Hochtief has completed the sale of 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment is 75 million.
FCC sees himself adjudiquer a tunnel in Slovenia to 64 million

A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to stop competition
The competition regulator French imposed a fine of 63 million euros to France Telecom for its anticompetitive behavior in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition in fixed telephony and mobile by signing exclusive agreements, through tariffs and loyalty programs to consumers on the sidelines of the regulation.
With this sanction, the French former monopoly and still state-owned company, has over 450 million in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday moreover been increased since the authority that oversees the competition considers that France Telecom has committed similar offenses in the past and it is a repeat offender.
An Application Shop
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed the trail of other operators and opened a shop of Internet applications, with the aim of increasing revenue not derived from the transmission of voice .
Initially, the shop of Orange applications will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It was not until 2010 that it happens in other countries like Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barcelona since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for the club since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have won 467.4 million, which puts them in third and fifth place clubs that have pocketed more money in this competition.
The Manchester United tops the list.
The Manchester United tops the list.
Winning the Champions League UEFA does not just glory. There is also a major source of income for big clubs.
Indeed, competition has allocated 5 362.5 million for 105 teams (including 12 in Spain) who participated in the event since the inception of the tournament during the 1992-1993 season, according to information from the UEFA.
The Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have been well served in this division.
The white club was the third of the continent to receive the most money for his participation, and the only one with AC Milan, winning the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, the current defending champion and recent winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
Heading the list are the Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams, in addition, billed the most money for their participation in the Champions League final.
And this, although they lost to Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country in respect of the money from the Champions League, despite having won more titles than any other (five, while the Italy has won four, three of England and Germany both).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of allocation of money applied by UEFA.
This year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1 090 million through the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413.1 million fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the classification matches (including the Atlético de Madrid) has received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, more than 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus if they win (800 000) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in the fourth round each receive three million, eight teams that arrive in the quarterfinals reçoivent3, 3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will earn 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, plus up to 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça has pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, which are allocated 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each TV market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, and has four seats own bankers.
The champion of last year pocketed 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid by the number of games played during the editing of the current year.
Nueva Rumas offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The group Nueva Rumas yesterday listed the details of the tender offer of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% stake in Sos.
A percentage that do not require it to launch a takeover bid (OPA) for all securities.

Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to remain outside any bids and to and fro of his former judicial guidelines, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Luis María Jordá as Director of Internal Audit .
A decision which is the first woman to occupy a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position will depend directly to the president of the group.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged embezzlement of more than 230 million Sos to companies of Salazar.
Moreover, the possibility that over the coming months Sos reveals new embezzlement can not be ruled out.
Regarding credit Salazar, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM representatives and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Court that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CNMV approves takeover exclusion Paternina by Inversora Wed

New tools for the expertise of cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, auto dealerships are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are reduced to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage and repair costs.
Every disaster is different, and calculating the cost of spare time and labor may be a long and complex.
