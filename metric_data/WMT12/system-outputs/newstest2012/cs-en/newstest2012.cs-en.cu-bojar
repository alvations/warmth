Parliament did not support the amendments to liberating Tymoshenko
Ukraine 's parliament today rejected a proposal to set aside in the amendments to the Criminal Code section, which was condemned by the opposition leader, Yulia Tymoshenko.
Legislation that would open the way to secure the release of the imprisoned expremiérky, members have rejected at the second reading of the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes.
Tymoshenko was in October, sentenced to seven years in prison for the conclusion of the supposedly unprofitable contracts with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final, an appeal by the court has dealt with in December.
Tymoshenko indicates the judgment of a political feud mode, suspicion of bias in the process, as well as in the West.
The proposal to the Criminal Code out section 365, on which the expremiérka sentenced, supported by the votes of 147 members.
The approval was needed 226 votes.
Libyan victory
The story of Libya 's liberation, or the libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried at an undisclosed location in the desert and without him, after the war.
Left to define the winner.
As is the custom, will win the election by the Islamists, but the thing is, whether moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council signed up to the common law of Sharia law, and he had an idea.
Libya is a free, because, for the theft is at hand.
Women can not forget the emancipation of, any apostate facing execution, and so on.
Place the dictator 's company consisting of rival tribes unite the Koran.
In Libya 's order, which we can not imagine who would want to.
But our way of life is not the only, not objectively the best and most likely would have to change not just the Libyans.
Actually, it is a wonder that islamic fighters take help from the dogs.
Says it is only that, from their point of view by NATO air strikes a general from America, but Allah, whose size in one intervention were celebrating.
So when they are looking for in Libya, the winners, the West is not among them.
We attended the shootings, one of Islam and our politicians, in the person of the dictator of political allies, without guaranteed to make a profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, Libya, a military occupation.
The local solves the problem with the expulsions of `` crusaders ''.
They will be without the occupation of the oil company for a song libyan black gold?
It may not be, and the West will finally be able to boast, for the protection of human rights.
If so, those followers of sharia law.
Is the beginning of a new era in the crisis.

The menu of obese children: breakfast and dinner sausage
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 years has problems with overweight, with excess weight is 9 percent of schoolchildren and obese is 5 percent of the children.
Obese children, most of them come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as demonstrated by the current survey.
Once again, shows how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which grows, and model, which is surrounded by.
On the tables in obese children, for example, some of the sausage up to half of the more frequently than in the families of children with normal weight.
French fries for dinner the day before research associated with awareness - raising actions with the name of obesity is not an accident more than 19 percent of the obese.
In families wieners also used to work out, which is, of course, the concerns of most families today 's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of the children answered that their parents at least once a week to find time for an active movement.
A survey of 900 children
A survey was carried out at the end of the last school year and attended him nearly 900 children of primary schools from around the country.
It was the second year of the actions of obesity is not an accident, which supports universal health insurance and Unilever.
So far, the project involved more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4 to 8. classes.
Proper diet and plenty of exercise in the family is one of the decisive factors, which causes dramatically increasing the number of children who are overweight or obese.
`` Only half of the respondents, for example, said that her five times a day in the breakfast - lunch - lunch - lunch, dinner, which is one of the basic requirements of good nutrition, ''is one of the results of the survey.
Free breakfast and evening the sausage
Experts suggest that, for the healthy development are essential and relative details, one of which is to be a regular time family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic while at the same time having breakfast, only 23 percent of the families of schoolchildren.
In most families eat breakfast each alone.
And the worst of it was that, in a tenth of households with breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the correct daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that the families of obese children are more often unhealthy eating french fries.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks each day sweet lemonade (70 percent).
On a regular basis, not a sport, more than 40 percent of respondents said the children, but for their parents, the result was less than half - 15 percent.
Report your diet
Another part of the survey to selected children (204 of boys and girls from 172 13 schools), of the options offered his own diet, according to their own tastes and his own opinion.
`` The dietary preferences of czech children aged 12 to 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet far from ideal. ''
Among his favorite food is a lot of flour, meat and fresh food.
`` The alarming is particularly great popularity of soft drinks, ''says in the final report of the survey.
For lunch, as a main dish won pasta just above the poultry.
The children but they did not want pulses and low is the popularity of the fish and the vegetable dishes.
The trend toward health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits, if they get the right information.
`` In the control group of participants in the survey, who filled out a questionnaire after the end of the educational lectures obesity is not a coincidence, it is, in many cases, a significant shift preferences towards the principles of a healthy diet, ''says in the results of the project.
It was noticeable, for example, in soft drinks, where he began to more children prefer plain water.
Children are also more often set in the questionnaire, poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and reduce the sweet food and dumplings.
Makeup artist must also be a good psychologist, says the pros
In the opening section on how to teach stylists, I am a little bit complained that it had in the early hours.
I had no idea what will happen next.
The lectures of three professionals in the field, wearing black characters and a seminar on how it goes on the set.
And it will get worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
And even if the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, is really `` crowded ''.
This time we are discussing with the director Alice (in the exchange rate is not the only kid), dressed as a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical shape.
And such is the overwhelming majority.
Someone has a short neck, someone 's boyish figure without curves and some overweight.
Makeup artist must know how optically soften his broad shoulders, extended his neck or to supply the necessary curves.
We got so tips, both for women like Jennifer Lopez, the greater her breasts and hips and a narrow waist, figure pretty stressed and at the same time a woman dressed too challenging.
If, for example, is the difference between the waist and hips that skirts or trousers really fit, then it pays to have made at least one of these to peace.
Certainly you will not regret it, because the perfect - fitting clothing is priceless.
In a skirt to peace will feel much better than the one that you are constantly shifting, shrugs, stood in the middle and the like.
The boyish figure, he can afford to wear clothes with folds, applications, embroidery or scooped.
Such information and the type of characters are, of course, many, so I am glad that I have a week to all of the information in the mind of the sort out.
And I fear that, due to the domestic task is not enough.
Each of the kurzistek gets assigned to the celebrity, which has come up with two outfits: the day and evening.
We have to take into account the current design, fashion and style of the personality of the type of character.
I will be the `` dress ''Miranda Kerrovou, perhaps you know it from the campaigns of Victoria 's Secret.
In the spirit of the jubilant, for me personally, certainly better than a Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained perhaps a hundred pounds (please do not take into account the hyperbole), or very young Selena Gomez.
We must avoid outfits from magazines or search on the Internet and print and graphically process.
Moodboard, the result, he says, then express my personal style and the relationship to design.
I think about the video site stylingu is important.
A stylist, dresses only physically, but also build, for example, the so - called product site in magazines (in particular the award, for example, trends, bags, coats, etc.).
It told us a stylist and designer Mario stonemasonry.
But it until Sunday.
Makeup artist must have a general overview
Saturday 's lecture loaded with information on the types of characters at three guests from the field.
Makeup artist John Humble, fashion designer James Polanky and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub remind us that fashion is an illusion and stylist should know how to use.
And a stylist knows how to work with a single piece of clothing in different ways.
The variability in this case is the key.
So a trenchcoat (or if you want to initially trenchcoat) you can wear a classically over jeans and t - shirt, but you can wear on his body, his shoes and photographed as a dress.
Or just roll up their sleeves and collars, and now the whole look is different.
`` Play with it, ''he stressed.
Most of all I appreciate the following advice: `` you need to work a perfect knowledge of the rules. ''
`` Then you can start to break, ''said Jim.
Finally, I am not clear why the smashing all those lessons, what with the combined, why, why, as well as in fashion magazines often we see something else.
On the show, not to mention.
Thanks to the photographer Ben again, I know that the stylist must have produced a lot more options than clothes, how many of them are taking pictures.
So in a fashion story, which will have 10 pages (ten outfits), I have to be ready to `` nastajlovat ''at least fifteen.
And also that a picture of the dress looks and works in combination with other pieces of often quite different than in reality.
With that, then we have got to in the formation of the outfits count.
That image and style is often half of success, we confirmed John Humble.
Just look at Madonna, who is not just a singer, but the image and marketing of the World Star.
In the Czech Republic 's approach to the use of the services of a makeup artist rather cold.
The familiar faces, it often considered unnecessary (just something I can do, how to be subordinated).
And if they get from us someone will create a styling, then we expect us to dictate a completely different (smaller) size than it really is.
Then there 's than googlovat and find out if the Boulevard of the celebrity ztoustla / weight and the like.
John and Mario on Sunday to a makeup artist is not enough to fashion and be able to put the outfits.
In their work, in particular, he interacts with people who dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
I can not judge people, pandering to stand up for his opinion.
`` When you get a manager, to all out her wardrobe and with some nice things, so you can not throw out of the closet and say, oh, my God. ''
`` There are at least a few of the things he said and recommend what to wear, ''says Mario.
We also specifically pointed out what it must include the so - called `` placovka '', or the bag on the field.
It is that which you turn around and you have all the necessary accoutrements.
In addition to clear things, such as the cylinder on hair or safety pins, there are also silk thread (with her stylist helps out for photos of products, such as handbags and hats), special clips, to join in the back of the clothes, if it is more (a pin or another clip is not acceptable, that would suit), or a sewing kit.
To hear, but also a practical test, we learned how to properly relined shoes.
Even at a photo shoot in the studio, which is equal to the surface, I could damage, let alone out there.
And so we are stuck, stuck.
The pair of shoes, was not hurt.
So the real skill.
Mario please me, when my creation without reservations, he said.
The skill that really is not my friend.
This is only a tiny fraction of what we do on the second weekend of course listened to.
I am getting more and more clear that, given the stylingu on a professional level really is not a walk in the park, to say what they want.
In Need for speed: the Run, racing across the whole of America.
Review
Originally Easy Rider, because of a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes change in routine morning trip to shift.
Ambition is to a large extent met, but it 's no good, when no one is reluctant to do anything more.
New part: the run up to the high expectations.
He promised that the age - old racing series of Need for speed again moves a new direction and a playable demos, appeared as a game, which would be in the genre of action racing might not be the only in number.
We were also curious about the passages in which the hero gets out of the car and will be on their own.
But, as in a series of NFS is customary, many of them in the outcome of a little differently than we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade racing, but the whole drags down several unnecessary errors, which is in a series of appear more or less for several years.
So it was not the error, but rather the manifestation of some incomprehensible lazy developers.
The adventure begins very well.
In the story, in which the hero Jack has some problems of a personal nature and the solution is to be participating in an illegal race across America.
Behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your job is to get the first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into 10 stages, and then to more than fifty businesses.
The result of this is that every race is run on a route and the stage is set in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
So does not even have a sense that the game is still the same.
Some of the environment, moreover, are very pretty to look at, even though the technical level of graphics corresponds to the series.
So it 's no big deal.
But the journey across the desert, autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.
The race is, in addition, from time to time complicated by some kind of amusing element.
In the desert, for example, few in the storm, which greatly reduces visibility.
By contrast, in the mountains, you have to pay attention to you in an avalanche.
Next to it are quite well for him at the individual races.
It 's not just a few types, but it' s enough.
He is now trying to pass the required number of rivals (in the classic race), then you are driving time (a classic duel with a stopwatch) and then waiting for you to be a duel with a single match.
It is even more from time to time he gets and the police, which all your efforts even more unpleasant.
News of the outside of the car.
Instead, it is only on such interactive animations, when Jack mostly run from someone and you must help so that, in the right moments of pressing the right buttons.
Nothing too complicated.
Surprise but that these passages in the game a lot less than you might expect (specifically, perhaps even only three).
As a result, but it 's a good thing, because this element does not have the chance to become poisonous, and in the context of the question is one of the elements that game break.
The model comes in the wake of the previous parts.
This means that in today 's world is not everything, but we can not say that would be drawbacks.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the action - based racing here the model is still quite well, although we in the competition to find a better.
Thus far, perfectly all right.
But the problems are starting to appear at a time.
Unlike the model of a very fine is not a model of conflict.
From the games of this type, we expect that the complex distortions and conflict, but when virtually no impact on any object, you do not have the faintest idea how your car it, then it 's all right.
Typically in a tight overtaking or passing cars in normal operation, sometimes only slightly each other at, but at other times in almost identical situation will end your car in the wild pirouettes.
Or even the right to smithereens.
Thanks to the system - it does not matter, but annoyed you can reliably.
The system is designed so that if I or you go far beyond the track, he will throw you a game back on the last point of reference on the track.
But the system is in every race available only five.
If it is not, you have to race to start from the beginning again.
It is therefore a such a device for the case, that something was wrong, but that it might actually be relied upon.
Sometimes, but not - they will not help solve it is up to the need to learn the section of the plant from memory.
The malady of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some of the curvy, for example, is the need to go through a specific way, otherwise they just come in.
Sometimes you will meet at the site of the `` civilian ''cars is always in the same configuration of whatever you get there first, fifth, five seconds sooner or later.
It sucks, especially in situations where you can see how between two oncoming cars opponent before you easily pass through, and when you get there, you are already cars in a position that is you have to drive around or slow down.
It is one thing to them, you get, because it is `` doomed ''so that the situation there was always just before your nose.
Opponents also have another advantage.
For all the time playing in several places, where you, again, regardless of the time, always gets the same opponent in the same place.
Most of the hits in the game on a bridge, where you are going in the opposite direction.
The opposition is there in front of you must have apparently not at any price.
When it 's in front of you, so you have exacerbated by an oncoming cars, so at first, about a couple of nice.
You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting, adrenaline, but it is so obvious that you can reliably quickly.
And it 's a shame, because, despite a simple model is playing entertaining and sometimes even enough action, that sometimes literally hectic track, where the flies.
And it is, in essence, one, whether it is the concept with his unique lines, ranking factories to boredom did not stand a chance, or anything else.
The non - traditional idea is the exchange of cars during the race.
You have to be careful at a gas station on the roads, because that 's where you can change the car, although in most cases you can get away with what you have got.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are appropriate in urban areas, a strong american cars to equal the highway and exotic Supersport on technical driving, for example, along the winding mountain roads.
With the main story scheme goes hand in hand and mode of calls, which are the races in each location, which you know the story.
There is not only the medals, but also experience points to your profile, which is common to the challenges of the story.
For a higher level of driver unlocks different objects, from the cars and the background to the profile.
It is at the same time again linked with on - line functions of Autolog, which, among other things, compare your results with other players and raises another community functions.
One of the more difficult to comprehend kicks, is the situation of the last race in the story.
In his car in a subway tunnel (is), where they are pushing in the dark on the tracks of (a).
On the odometer you are flashing numbers between 150 and 200 km / h (is) and in the back - line metro and uncompromising you grinding.
In the newsroom for me for a few more days will hold a debate on whether, in the formation of the game no one really think, or whether we have the authors for really that big a fool.
The technical side of the game is not great, but at least the visual effect is, in most cases, a very pleasant and, in a few cases, even brilliant.
Upset so that, in some intense moments is falling, and that in some cases quite tragic.
It concerns but, above all, car crashes with a number of participants, the smooth - it was no use.
The site is in order and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to appeal to the widest range of a younger audience a soundtrack from `` there '', but it is safe to assume that because of listening to music in the game only about someone will buy.
The overall impression of the Need for speed: the Run is quite embarrassed.
If the game to avoid unnecessary errors, then I say, that 's the best run of NFS in the last few years.
But this game is nedodělaně.
Fun is certainly good, but get ready for it, that you are bang in the eyes of the strength of the airport floodlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenová:
The Czechs are so negative, Charlie and euroskeptics
`` The Treaty of Lisbon have tipped the balance between the institutions. ''
`` I did not expect it to be so tough war. ''
`` It will take five, six years before the situation a little bit, and calms down than all the players are used to their new roles, ''she said, his speech at the Faculty of Law of the Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová.
As far as its motto `` clearly and openly about Europe ''takes seriously, she showed in the first part of the course, where she was able to describe the EU institutions and their relations so easy - and clearly she could be that many of the speakers from the Law Faculty of envy.
Vicenová also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
`` At first appeared criticism that is flat, that is the official, that he can not play any role, and I have to say that all the breath out of that role very well for himself. ''
`` This is a man who can listen to the twenty - seven Member States, well done to communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go. ''
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said in response to the question: `` who is the European Union? on which a phone number to call? ''and, therefore, a major step in the unification and greater legibility of EU policy on countries such as China or India.
None of us wants to prohibit cheesed
Vicenová went on to the agenda, which the European Council was, is and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency has identified as a success.
The Czechs have handled the financial crisis, with the gas or hold a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time he has identified as a big negative, which the Czech Republic very severely damage.
The czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, `` really slow ''was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that was resolved today.
In addition, has yet to approve a new seven - year budget of the Union, which is due to the current economic situation far more difficult.
Whether the budget will be a lean and efficient, that the industry will be given priority, that the country will be supported by more and more, all of that is on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador said his main slogans, which came to Brussels: `` Europe manner ''.
`` I really do not like the ugly symbol, foreign words, jargon, that no one understands.
As a citizen to understand, that really is in Brussels say the curved or round cucumbers, bananas degrees, or that we really need someone to prohibit cheesed. ''.
He also wants to make better use of the environment in the EU and get more of the Czechs to european institutions.
We have a multi - speed Europe
According to the ambassador to the Czechs reputation euroskeptics, and people who do not pay attention more negative than positive aspects of the case.
In addition, she was sorry low representation of the Czechs in the european institutions.
The fault is under a lot of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write letters, but also low support from the czech side.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency then underlined the strength and the cooperation of the Visegrad quartet.
`` Believe me, when it comes to me polish and hungarian and Slovak, so the Frenchman next to me said, `` Hey, what 's out there, what' s your Visegrad four? `` and never looked happy. ''
In the future, the Union under Vicenová are especially tough new rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As a very real, the concept of a two speed, if not a multi - speed Europe, rather than the new `` European Federation. ''
`` We have the euro - zone countries and countries outside the eurozone. ''
`` We have the Schengen area, we have had and the Institute of enhanced cooperation. ''
`` For the first time it was told to cooperate only countries that want to, and those who do not want to be standing close. ''
`` The Institute will be more, and it will be a two - speed Europe, ''expects Vicenová.
In this respect, also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in enforcing the principle, according to which all of the issues that have an impact on the whole of the Union, the discussion between all the Member States, not only between the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
An innovator IBM begins the second century of his existence
Someone looking for words that convey the strategy of IBM, say `` long term ''.
For the general public 's IBM symbol of the technological revolution, it is the name of the perceived as very current, and yet, since its founding more than a hundred years.
The basis of this long term laid the first head of the firm, a visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He coined the word that many of the world 's problems can be easily resolved, if people are willing to think about.
His motto, `` Think! ''in the past, which will form the basis for the life of the future giant (and also the name of the internal magazine, which in IBM began to be based in 1935).
It was also the basis for Watson carefully cultivated corporate culture.
`` For us from IBM 's long - term thinking of continuous movement toward the future.
IBM has survived and prospered, a hundred years due to remain true to its core values, and it is not all about change.
It allowed us to during our first centuries of transformative technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second hundred that we can do even more, ''he said to the anniversary of the current chairman of the company 's Samuel J. Palmisano.
The elaborate system
Watson in the 1930 s to care for their employees as a businessman Baťa in the Czech Republic - the IBM was one of the first american workers paid vacation, insurance from their employer, plus an elegant staffing uniform and an elaborate system to reward the best inventors, and traders.
As advanced has long - term IBM and the relationship with the customer.
The company has since the beginning of the genius in the extraction of talent - as one of the first global firms to abolish discrimination of any kind, so he could collect.
In accordance with the strategy of the anti - discrimination is the current plan that Palmisano, IBM in the lead in the next year will be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
The IBM in the work of thirty years, still holds the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM in recent years doing so - called yams, on - line brainstorms, of which raises many future strategies and innovation.
It is no wonder that the ideas is enough - the company he works for almost half a million people.
The institution with a good name
The firm position in business gives us a strong internal and external image.
`` From the beginning, IBM, rather than just the concept of the institution of technology companies, ''said Economistu Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
`` IBM 's technology company, but a firm that helps to solve business problems for the use of technology, ''said George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself, he says, is the difference between the market and the market right to create.
IBM - or `` big blue, ''as it is due to its logo in the United States familiarly nicknamed - in a hundred years have grown into one of the largest companies in the world.
It is apparently versatile technology company, is developing the software and hardware infrasturukturu, hosting and consulting services in the range of products from servers for nanotechnology.
Holding the most patents in U. S. technology companies and five of his employees received the Nobel Prize.
Among her accomplishments include the need to withdraw cash, credit card, financial swap, bar code or disk.
IBM is roughly 220 billion dollars this year, has become the second largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time since 1996, has been overtaken by Microsoft.
Look forward
Not all products and innovation is a taste of customers and time - IBM, for example, made a bet on its own operating system, OS / 2, the online service Prodigy or computer IBM PCjr.
`` If your business is built on the move forward, you can be emotionally tied to the past, ''poznamává to Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem to build the foundations of the many platforms - and when do not work, so as to leave them.
In contrast to, say, the rival Microsoft, which in principle it stands or falls on the Windows operating system.
Promising technology
The IBM is the largest share of services, after roughly a fifth of the software and hardware.
Yet in 1990, with more than half the strongest advocate hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold a few profitable assets worth $15 billion, during the same period has invested 58 billion dollars to purchase of promising technologies.
In the investment continues from 2008, when, for the first time, the world over the financial crisis.
IBM is in accordance with the legacy of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression, also increased the volume of investment.
Still, it seems that IBM passes through the current crisis.
The price of the shares of IBM since the beginning of the year 2008 increased by rocket 120 percent, net income, the company continuously growing.
IBM 's corporate motto change everything, but its value.
Therefore, it can be expected that, even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant it can handle.
The history of IBM: from cheese slicers after years in space
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York in front of a hundred years ago, originally had a complicated name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.

Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers, the chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, bought a consultancy firm part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to give advice and services with high added value.
The strategy, which in the past three years, IBM 's Smarter Planet paid - the concept, `` smarter planet ''.

The worst of the women 's bad habits: affect you?
If you ask the men, if they could name a typical women 's bad habits, as a rule, every one of them very quickly out of the sleeve.
Nice women, in the following lines, where a number of women 's bad habits, which can make the perfect light up the blood in his veins?
Shopping
I do not blame you for your other half, that you are dependent on shopping?
You have to buy at least one rag week?
I like to shop and en masse in discounts?
Then, in your case you can talk about buying a home.
Some of the women are aware that, should their nakupovatelskou passion at least a little tame.
But tell that that was just walking around the shops for clothes, looking for a well - fitting clothes, and then it 's all (ideally in different colors) to test in the stall?
Even if it is for the majority of women shopping hobby, for a man can be literally hell.
Just think, how many times have you had your said, whether you prefer to wait outside the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
`` I am not too fat? ''
`` I need to lose weight at least five pounds - I should start exercising? ''
`` Do you like me? ''
Do you recognize these sentences something?
Is not it?
Then one of those women who are obsessed with.
No, you have to stop to take care of myself, but a lot of the men is allergic to it that their partner constantly complain about his appearance.
The stronger sex is the same, that the frequency of this carping increases, the women are difficult.
The order and cleanliness in the first place
It 's like an endless carousel.
Washing windows, vacuuming, mopping floors, dusting, scouring the tub - and it at least twice a week.
Blaming partner, he stepped on the dirty feet to clean the floor, children, that made the well - scrubbed the basin and opatlaly glass - fronted the living wall, with its shiny, so much work?
In the event that you have just this `` aberration '', try to remember that enough 's enough and neat and tidy definitely should not stand in the framework of the family in the first place.
This harmless the desire for a clean, may harm your mutual relations and the family 's well - being.
Jibes
`` You used the shorts throw into the trash. ''
`` The old socks you undertake too tomorrow? ''
`` Damp towel yet on the ground does not belong. ''
If his partner as follows with several times a day, you should know that it so you can reliably dial.
Of course, that 's not bad, you want to do, that everything was fine.
Maybe, if they knew the men, women must not so much nag.
The denigration, gossiping
For some women are also owns rumors, gossip, but even insulting and ganging up against anybody.
Women are focused on relationships, and they like to discuss the matter of who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us a little harmless gossip or gossip here and there.
Hand on heart, it 's own almost all women.
But they are the opposite of `` most outrageous, and often yakking, perhaps every scorned and are for their surroundings - especially in the context of the women 's work team - especially dangerous.

The development of the prices package since 1989
In 1989, it was in the former Czechoslovakia allowed only five state travel agencies: Michelin, Sporturist, COM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel office at the time of the sale in the overwhelming majority of only tours to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very limited.
Czech tourists to travel on a vacation to the sea in the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and in Hungary (Lake Balaton).
The notable exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when she was able to travel and to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime turned to the west and the czech tourists in Yugoslavia is very limited.
The great paradox of the socialism was that it was not the citizens of the socialist bloc (i. e. Czechoslovakians) allowed to travel freely individually or in the context of the socialist countries.
In the event that the Citizen of Czechoslovakia individually to travel to Poland, for example, or to the Soviet Union, so he needed in this country a letter of invitation from, or the way possible.
The travel office at the time as offering package tours to the West, but it was the need to queue through the night sleeping bag or be in the `` good friends ''.
Even so, however, it was not out of the woods.
The so - called international commitment, which was provided for the trip to the West, was awarded the `` politically unreliable people '', which can travel at all.
The currency is not freely convertible currency, free of foreign - exchange commitment, so it was not possible to obtain funding (western currency) on the way to the west.
By far the most often, however, the Czechs were on vacation in the country, and the result was a large number of cabins and cottages, which the Czechs to procure and this custom survives to this day.
The Czechs travel so experienced since 1989, the real revolution.
While in 1989, it was a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria our best last year spent the Czechs abroad 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
The paradox is that you are already aware of, it 's that, for us, is currently the most popular of Croatia was not possible in 1989 to travel freely, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Now in the early 1990 's, following the abolition of the visa requirement to neighbouring west european countries, which triggered a huge surge of short - term visits in Vienna, Austria or Germany.
Czechoslovakians, for a long time, can not get enough of the trips to the west, everybody wanted to at least for a second look.
For example, in Paris for tours of the Czechs in parks in tents, since the revenue to pay for a hotel or guesthouse.
A typical feature of the travel of the Czechs were in this time of the haul of their own food cans, sausages, etc., to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertible crown, which our tourists could finally after many years destítkách freely to buy western currency.
Our standard of living, and with it the average salaries, however, rose, prompting around 1997 in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel beginning to travel regularly from 1997 to prepare the tours of charter flights, which will air travel because of the possibility of contract volume discounts in comparison with the past incredibly cheap.
In the late 1990 s, had already czechs visa - free travel to virtually all of the world 's advanced countries, in addition to the US, which continue to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post - revolutionary travel was in 2000, when he was due to strong demand of the Czech Republic 's first charter flight to exotic, it was in Thailand.
From this year, and each year the world with czech tourists direct flights to warm far countries, this year 's winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic country currently visit already around 100 thousand Czechs per year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post - revolutionary development, came in 2008.
 November 17, 2008, abolished the US visas for czech tourists and that our country has ranked among the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in the history of the spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%), and for the first time in the history of it spent on a foreign holiday, including the costs of the whereabouts of more than 15 000 per person.
The AGM is to find the President again but there is a stalemate
Almost five months is the czech football without the president, and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Jaroslav Hašek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known after another extraordinary general meeting, which will be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
Still, there is no agreement, under which the electoral system will be followed.
Without it, they do not begin to vote on which of the three candidates will be chosen.
The result, the czech football have Henry Rajchl, Miroslav Pelt and Thomas Paclík.
Hašek resigned from office in June, and upon his retirement urged colleagues to unite and found a strong personality, which would have led to a football game in the future.
But in the era after Hašek football back to the clashes between the two republics houses, which can not agree on a joint candidate.
And it turned out 16 September, which was to be the new chairman of the selected.
Delegates of the general meeting of the National House in Prague on Smíchově down unnecessarily, since the negotiations remained blocked, and not just the way the elections.
There was not a consensus, who has the right to a pile of actually vote - if only the statutory representatives, or even officials the power of attorney.
In this one point since there was a partial match, which was helped by the recommendations of the Institute for the state and the law, according to which the representation of the mandate is not possible.
Disputes but still there is on the electoral system.
Too much clarity on the situation, nor the Executive Committee, which had at its meetings, both ordinary and extraordinary, in essence, nothing else.
Look at the choice of several times had changed, but a neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3 rd round, in order to avoid the possibility of stalemate?
`` The dispute is about whether to proceed in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, or to find a different model, ''said one of the three vice - presidents FAČR Dusan Svoboda, who in the leadership of the association representing professional football.
Under the proposed model in the third round of the of the candidates, who will have a greater percentage of support in the chamber, for which he 's running.
Moravia is reportedly willing to go to compromise in order to win the candidate who gets more total per cent of votes from both chambers.
And the czech party advocating a condition that the winner must in the census to get at least a two - thirds majority.
`` But it would then become the two previous rounds, it would completely contradicted a bicameral concept, ''he understands the objections of the parties' freedom, according to which would be the best order do not bend and to vote in accordance with the applicable statutes.
With that, somewhat surprisingly, agrees Thomas Paclík, though, it is estimated that the statutes of the electoral procedure complies with all the candidates most Pelt.
`` I wish to have voted for a maximum of the statutes. ''
`` In order to make up some of the nonsense as of last week 's meeting, ''said the owner of the Victoria, who stands for the first time and in their statements, is primarily against Pelt.
Pelt remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, according to him, the new chairman of the unknown, and believe that the candidates together will be in the future work constructively.
`` All the passions calmed any of today 's procedure for the national team to the World Cup. ''
`` Football again will be happy to wave, will be a greater willingness to cooperate, ''says jablonecký deputy, who is from the three largest experience in the management of football as a professional, and regional level.
Rajchl is reticent.
`` I hope in the agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is very ambivalent. ''
`` It 's not among the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to assigned to adapt to the legislation. ''
`` It may cause it to stop the general meeting again. ''
`` I hope, however, that the good sense, ''said Rajchl.
The agreement of all parties have a lot of time left.
Some of the negotiations, was supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the contest will be football the generals do not complete.
Executive jet, in which they had to move to Podgorica, among other things, the vice - presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, namely from Prague due to a technical malfunction in the morning and was looking for a replacement option, as part of the Executive Committee of the barážové retaliation.
Finally, it might be a crucial meeting at ministerial level, that can occur in the center.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to split the party inside the strongest sports associations in the country to the agreement.
In the game, it 's a lot: public subsidies, the credibility of the football and also the forthcoming AGM ČSTV, which will bring a new direction for english sport after the financial problems of the condition.
Paclík goes to fight for the President, because there is a suitable candidate
If the boss of footballers attractions Thomas Paclík before an extraordinary general meeting saw a strong candidate, which meets all of his ideas for the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), it would not be in the fight for the top post.
`` If the quality of Adept existed, I am fighting for him, and I am not going into the elections. ''
`` But in the current situation, no one had failed to find, ''said Stein Paclík.
In a battle with Miroslav Pelt and Henry Rajchlem drives Paclíka motivation to just Pelt, alleged the champion of the elections, he tried to avoid in the road in front of the FAČR.
Paclík also points out that, in the case of his victory in the role of the president he lasted only until 2013, when it 's time for the Annual General Meeting.
In office would probably like to see an experienced and top executive, who is not associated with a football background.
`` With some of the people who came into account, I am talking. ''
`` For me, it was crazy, but some say that, at the moment, with the czech football do not want to identify. ''
`` I wanted to change, ''he said.
Paclíkovi says he now most of all is Peltovo connection with the president of the CAS regional football association Romano Berbrem, a man with a controversial reputation, which is behind the scenes, known as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the meeting.
For Paclíka is unacceptable to Pelt stood in the position.
`` If he won, so the sealing the state and not be in football. ''
`` In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a businessman, be it football do even more, ''said Paclík.
Faces that Peltovo name years ago came in tapping in an investigation of corruption, of which, however, Pelt went unpunished.
`` I do not know what the prestige of the football Peltovo victory would bring. ''
`` Also, how they looked in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA, ''said Paclík, but they are already taking his statement that he would `` sell Plzeňský club, if Pelt became president.''
In the event that the Paclík in Thursday 's election triumph, but with Pelt imagine future cooperation.
As he and the other candidate Rajchl, which Paclík supported before the September meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
`` He (Pelt), was the first I 'd go. ''
`` He has a great ability. ''
`` I could imagine him to be as head of the team. ''
`` But - schedule would drive the association could not. ''
`` I also do where I can not do that, ''says Paclík, which attracted a great deal of attention in September that he was behind the Commission of arbitration in the lead with Luďkem Macelou, which replaced the Dagmar Damková.
Paclík claims that the leadership of the Association of chance.
Refers to the ability of private firms, since last summer 's in charge also Pilsen, who with his promotion in May to celebrate the opening league triumph.
`` I have to force his way in the football environment changed something to contribute to its particular culture. ''
`` To limit the effects of certain interest groups, which should have a tendency to affect the disciplinary and appeal to the Commission, which is up to the situation, ''says Paclík, who kept his antipathy, for example, to the spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
As one of the priorities would also considered the cement relations FAČR with czech Olympic Committee, which it for political leaders lobbied for it to be in the sport received more money from the lottery and taxes.
`` It is one of the key things that should be the new President. ''
`` If there is a tax on gambling, as declared political parties, so I understand their reasoning, but frankly they need to say where the money will go, ''he said.
As a burden now Paclík did not take his connection with the Pilsner club, although he says that the President FAČR should be `` bipartisan ''.
Pelt is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
`` It 's not ideal. ''
`` But I do not see no point in it, to be hypocritical transferring its shares in the `` Club and a year and a half to go back to, ''says Paclík.
Pelt promised new statutes FAČR, which would exclude the election stalemate
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelt promised that, if elected, to FAČR new statutes, which would in future definitively exclude disputes over the electoral system.
Jablonecký functionary is ahead of Thursday 's hearing in Nymburk optimistic and believe that the campaign significantly dampen any success tonight football team.
Pelt before September the choice has promised that the right to representation and the acquisition of the Treasury intends to use in the event of the election of focus.
In the last election before the General Assembly decided to go at the last minute, and then the two - month suspension could use to his ideas about the governance of football champion and introduced in a broader context.
`` People at all levels of football, they are doing it for a very long time, and they expect that, on Thursday will be the President of the unknown. ''
`` He feels that it is high time that the Association of someone, ''says the man who is associated primarily with Jablonec club, but that a number of years in Sparta, the Executive Committee of the Soviet Union.
I therefore believes that he has enough experience to the czech football to drive.
He is convinced that the current problems with the election 's euphoria, as it was at the time of the Government of Ivan Jaroslav Hašek.
`` Unfortunately, in the June meeting were approved by the rules, which were not so perfect, it was thought. ''
`` If it would make it impossible for the different interpretations, President, we have had since September, ''said Pelt.
Just the most important document the civic association he conceived as a decoy to delegates.
`` If I become president, I will take it as a personal challenge, and I am willing to give a personal responsibility, if you can not do it. ''
`` It 's a matter of principle, without which we can be, ''says Pelt.
Still, he says, trying to define against their rivals.
We previously announced that it can imagine cooperation with Henry Rajchlem, which recognises because of his legal training, and knows that his opponent was its first vice - president.
For a long time, he did not attack or at Thomas Paclíka, who, on the other hand, to Pelt did not let the thread of dry.
`` In football is a little over a year, has had some successes. ''
`` The attacks were, however, undignified and a lot of people in the election campaign. ''
`` And so many of them now has doubts about his true character, ''he said to his opponent 's address Pelt, who says he remains faithful to proclamations, which announced in September.
His strongest weapon is in his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions until after the entertainment.
This should be a showcase of football.
`` And I also tried to put an end to all of the affair from the case of Bohemians or the aftermath of last year 's corruption scandal. ''
`` Then I went to a meeting with the private and public sectors, to ensure enough money for the whole game, ''said Stein a candidate two months ago.
It also promised that his approach to the head of football is no personnel purges.
`` I would have had to be the first to meet the individual employees, ''said the Strahov, where the long interregnum, there is an understandable anxiety.
Despite the current disaster scenarios, which accompany the forthcoming general meeting, believes that Thursday 's delegates to Nymburk unnecessarily.
`` If it is the only issue, how they will vote in the third round, so that you can get. ''
`` Football needs credibility, and that will only be finally back their leader, ''remains Pelt two days before possibly decisive day of his career funkcionářské optimistic.
Rajchl promises that he FAČR began to work hard
If the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic on Thursday 's general meeting elected former vice - president of Henry Rajchl, many people in the Association said it was pleased.
Rajchl had promised that, in the case of his election will begin to work hard.
He wants to change and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the football field.
It also promised to solve the case Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, football to bring in more money and continue to work, which began with the previous President Ivan Hašek.
`` As chairman, I wanted to football as a whole. ''
`` From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA over entertainment, professional football, football after the youth. ''
`` But this is not to say that I would do everything alone, ''said Rajchl in an interview with Mr.
`` I am a team player and I want to do in the distribution of competences so that each of the members of a certain area. ''
`` And I will be handing out the hard work that is in any this segment of the move football on a great step forward. ''
`` Many people might think, because I work really hard and not just criticize the work of others, ''he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement said he was considering running for reelection.
`` For me to know that I am doing 20 hours a day. ''
`` But I need to know that it would make sense and that he will not have the people who will always turn, and to question my every step of the way, ''he explained why he hesitated.
`` A lot of people say he can not give up, because then it would have given up and others. ''
`` It 's confidence, which I can not just throw it away, ''he said.
Motivates him and the continuation of the work, which began with Jaroslav Hašek.
`` For two years, he 's done a great job and I do not want to throw away now. ''
`` They are the processes that will have the aftermath should be for a couple of years, and I do not want to be stopped, ''he said with concern that, if elected, another candidate Miroslava Pelt, it is said, the situation in the Soviet Union could go back to a time before Jaroslav Hašek.
`` I believe in a systematic way, and that is something that I think Mirek Pelt can not. ''
`` For him are mainly to people who would do football so that was just for one. ''
`` I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not that someone take the part. ''
`` I try to be objective. ''
`` I want to do the football for all, because then you will be all right, and not just the chosen ones, ''said Rajchl.
Refutes the claim that he was only the czech president.
`` Even though some people try to argue otherwise, so I plan to do for Moravia maximum. ''
`` For example, it 's time to think about it, that would be the second League split into the Czech and Moravian part, whose winners have gone into the Premier League. ''
`` There is, as the current situation, where they are in the league of just three of the units, which is a problem in the direction of the young players in Moravia, ''said Rajchl.
As the President, the boss of the Pilsen club Thomas Paclík, dare not Rajchl estimate of his chances in the election.
`` But I feel strong support in the Czech Association, which I choose as his vice - chairman, and that for me is the clear development, ''stated Rajchl, which in its development is your savings of tens of millions of kronor on a contract, negotiated television contracts and negotiations on the lottery to the law.
Instead, he gives the complicity that force pulling together.
While the Pelt says it is `` disqualified from the back of the czech football confidence '', the other contender Paclíka is considered a strong candidate that football has to offer.
`` No one can dispute that, in Pilsen in the year I did a wonderful job. ''
`` If he was elected, so perhaps he continued in those cases, which started the Ivan Hašek and not fundamentally change of personnel in the Commission. ''
`` I want to curl up in his favour, ''assesses the rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools of Europe
The jump into the blue
Julia Stanek
Paddling pool from the point of view of an alien, a swimming pool in Budapest, who travels across Europe, it may experience his blue miracle - and after visiting cities or travel to let their tired legs rest in the thermal baths.
The book shows, where 's the wellness at the water' s most beautiful.
When the Iris Meder in the past one and a half year on a voyage of discovery, in his luggage missing: her bathing suit.
Lying on his back on the water, looking up at the height of the elaborate set the dome, swam across the marble putti (the figure of a naked boy, the child 's (with wings)), which was on the edge of the pool, admiring the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If some of the outdoor pool, in the blink of an integrated it into my notebook - with the notable details about how the building and the history of the building.
More than 200 of swimming examined in this way, a historian of architecture Meder and represents is now in his recently published by the book `` Badefreuden (the pleasure of bathing) '': the People 's swimming pools in Munich, the historic palace of swimming in the Black Forest, `` the hard core of concrete buildings'' in Taunus.
The 13 countries led her `` path for a spa in Central Europe '': in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited the site in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46 - year old german woman is a real entuziastkou plovárenské culture.
The sport was not overdoing it, says Meder - only in the water, it 's something else.
The anger is just that fans of swimming must content itself with the blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while the runners for health can be inhaled the fragrance of spruce forests or listening to the chatter of birds in the park.
`` One day, I asked why, in fact, the group must always be so ugly, ''says in Vienna living Mrs Meder.
`` So I started to collect a nice pool. ''
The water level of the doubling of architecture
Splash in the diving pool and essential oils for the sauna - factor of well - being is so large that applies to all the senses, as Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders could pool a feast for the eyes: `` instead of the floor has a man in the bath water. ''
`` It is both transparent, but on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the building. ''
It is visually doubling: the coloured tiles, diving boards.
The small - format picture volume `` Badefreuden (the pleasure of bathing '') provides for 190 pages of all you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oases wellnes - but especially tempted to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens discovered a lover of swimming Mrs Meder in his quest in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful medicinal baths, like 100 years ago Chain in Budapest, found water containing nitrate in the original karst cave (the bath in Miskolc - Tapolca) and thermal spas, swimming pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in the building of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
The magnificent spectacle, on the other hand, offer many heated swimming pools in the open air in Switzerland and Austria. while the man is from Zurich 's nástřešního swimming pool in the eyes of the city, may be in the outdoor pool, a spa in St. Anton look at the snow - covered Arlberg - and, in the steam baths' s window, from which it is possible to monitor traffic on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most striking design pool expects the spa guests in Längenfeldu: akvapark Ötztal looks like a UFO, which has just landed in the Alps.
Of the three top open basins in the winter, while in the background of the mountain Ötztalu stands up to the sky.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in each of the swimming pool rose lover of pools of Mrs Meder smell of chlorine into the nostrils.
Many of the thermal baths are feeling of sulfur, spa Árpád in hungarian Békescsabě it smells of fuel oil to the extent that you can hardly believe it to be in the treatment of the spa.
The smell coming from the water with the content of the alkaline bicarbonate, who is black and whose deposits stick to the skin, as soon as the only man in the pool - a special experience of wellness.
However, there is also a place where the Iris Meder in his quest for a spa disappointed: when I wanted to visit the Czech solar and spas Luhačovice, struck a closed terrain.
1902 architect Dušan Jurkovič proposed baths were concluded in the meantime.
When Mrs Meder looked crumbling windows of the red - and - white - yellow Art Nouveau buildings, saw a massively growing weeds between the tiles.
The demise of the stand, on the other hand, in a swimming pool in the Black Forest: in the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas are already over three stages of construction; you can not just show up this neo - romanesque elements, which come from its inception in 1844, but also the moorish Hall in the style of the Alhambra, around 1900.
Since the close of the Palais Thermal favorite spa pools with Ms. Iris Meder, and not only because it comes from the Black Forest.
`` It 's a performance, so a variety of architectural styles into a complex '', says Ms Meder.
In the palace 's immersion in the thermal pool seemed marginal.
The speculation
Deutsche Bank has to deal with commodities
Christian Teevs
It left Deutsche Bank their trade in agricultural commodities?
According to the information SPIEGEL ONLINE - Josef Ackermann 's working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world' s poor.
In January, he wants the group to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the case is clear: 84% of germans by one study as unacceptable to banks speculating on agricultural commodities such as wheat and corn.
Two - thirds of respondents even require that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions of this trade stood out because of the problems of the poorest of the world.
It is the result of the poll Fors on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study was based on a report which Foodwatch presented in mid - October.
It shows the author Harald Schumann, that the stakes in global commodity exchanges driving prices higher, and the banks because they are complicit in the problem of world hunger.
The campaign 's consumer is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, though also velkobanky like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting like.
Originally, commodity bets intended to enable traders to insure against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, but most experts agree that the parties to the capital market with an interest in high - risk business disengaged from the supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Other than competitors in the United States responded to the criticism: Ackermann promised that criticism, and said that no business `` is not worth it, so that was a good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk ''.
According to Spiegel Online controls the international criticism of the working group Foodwatch - Report.
By the end of the year to be checking closed, then the results will be presented to the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank - together with the recommendation, as it is to be disposed of.
At the end of January then leaders want banks to tell what the consequences of a draw.
In the end, it could be the reduction in commodity trading, or even complete rejection.
Ackermann is a self - help to its image.
The organisation Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time, its criticism of the financial sector: `` betting on rising food prices shows in particular drastically, as ruthlessly Bank today is bad for the common good. ''
Whatever Ackermann as the bank lobbyist to meet obligations.
`` Deutsche Bank must cut out of its portfolio of all of the items, which are used the money for betting on food prices, ''said Bode.
`` No matter whether Mr. Ackermann of people suffering from hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank. ''
Ackermann preview appears at first glance like a surprising, but it is clear that the group, the head of a few months before his departure from office would have left the perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank, has announced that the Board of Directors differently than planned, to the supervisory board.
From the Agricultural speculation could do to improve his image.
And the potential losses to worry about - you should consult his successor.
Every other investments in raw materials has terminated
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on manager.
Yet already more than 30,000 Internet users on the campaign organization.
On Tuesday released the poll, in which the Institute Fors on 7 and 8 November poll 1001 people.
Just 11 percent as it considered legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investment, with which they are linked bets on food prices.
Many of the customers of the banks, it is also the personal consequences if they learned that their bank involved in such transactions: each other, as a result of the survey were terminated all investments away money into speculation in commodities.
43 percent said known in front of a bank, 49 percent reported that a denunciation of his account, and goes to another institution.
The house of the 21 st century in Vienna
A displaced Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of the architecture with peaks, falls and a happy ending: the austrian pavilion at the World Expo in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became the museum in Vienna, stood empty and ruin.
It is now open again as the exhibition of the house.
When the all - out for the modern postwar architecture, for obvious forms, a glass lobby, bold strokes and new construction materials, which are typical of belief in technological progress, then it is the austrian pavilion architect Charles Schwanzera for the Brussels World 's Fair 1958 concise and illustrious example.
Schwanzerův Pavilion received at the Grand Prix d 'Architecture for his mild and vznosně operating structure of steel and glass.
The construction is still seen as a milestone of contemporary architecture.
Famous architect, also for the next World Expo pavilion built of Austria.
With his legendary four - cylinder BMW - plus the palace as the key carried out by building in Munich, 1973 internationally famous.
His as a temporary exhibition building designed pavilion at the World 's Fair in Schweizer Garten in Vienna Südbahnhof (South Station), and in 1962, opened the Museum of the 20 th century - was named as the `` house of the 20 th century ''.
But the building was not appropriate for the museum, or geographic or technically - were missing from the walls for the suspension of art exhibits, no satisfactory climate.
Yet it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna of the new stand.
Since 2001, the building was empty and dilapidated more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilion, is now the name `` 21 st century ''and will in future be used as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening there will open the Belvedere museum, which includes the Palace, the first exhibition - happy intention in every respect.
Setting up a new start Agnes Husslein - Arco, which became the new head of the austrian Galerie Belvedere.
Husslein - Arco, across an art historian with a prominent career, M. J. in youth skater, later at Sotheby 's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the museum of modern Salzburg, pushed strongly for the reconstruction of the politicians and preservationists, with public funds and private sponsorship money and a recovery.
In addition to the contemporary art should not be subject to the work of the sculptor Fritz Wotruby the foundations, should there be a cafe and bookstore, and had to be built from the office building.
Strict supervision, low - budget.
The implementation was then Krischanitz ideally cast.
Not only that, sensitively restored and expanded the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna, and he won the competition, but because, in Schwanzera studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him `` extremely important '', `` almost every weekend'' at the exhibition.
He knew of the project and also about the problems of the building, which is already in its relocation to Vienna and change of use of the lost for their generosity and lightness.
In the current reconstruction were far more problems: the building was `` the trap for energy, ''says Krischanitz.
Profiles of window glass facades were exchanged, used glass fibre reinforced with insulating glass and glass roof replaced by a special security glass.
Chladové bridges - steel beams were strengthened or replaced, and the asbestos completed ceilings rescued.
Two underground floor space for new uses, recessed lighting channel between the building and the street - lighting, to the entrance leads the bridge - almost a new building, but still lift Schwanzerův pavilion.
The original front door were maintained, the building is painted in the old anticorrosion reddish color tone.
And the screen is even more exactly the same as it was before.
And all of this by English Heritage Authority and a low budget.
`` Often had to be found material, which is a good, cheap and also liked the Antiquities Authority '', says Krischanitz and notes on the floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, and the problems of the reconstruction was building a flexible and airy.
He said that it was difficult to the pavilion, `` who came here from Brussels, ''he said recently Krischanitz, a typical `` drop - in - the - City - history''.
Such architecture was said to be `` always in the wrong place ''and still wants to `` wake up the appropriate self - confidence''.
In this case, but it 's not the 21 st century on, as happened to the happy coincidence: in a circle around the Schweizer Garten, a completely new design `` urban neighborhood near the main train station' s office and residential buildings.
And yet there is a different circumstance: the 21 st century could receive support from other Krischanitzovy buildings, as the lover of Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle, and how it is heard, it is with the city for the neighborhood to the post in the Schweizer Garten.
The planned package for winter crisis in Millions of

It will cost millions.
In the fight against the cold caused by disruptions and delays by Deutsche Bahn in this year, according to a report in the newspaper more than 70 million euros.
`` The newspaper Bild ''has provisionally report with reference to the internal group plan, that is until 2015, with a total investment of around 300 million euros.

Deutsche Bank is a million dollar fine in the U. S.
After the furor surrounding chief Josef Ackermann leads to new trials in the US: Deutsche Bank there must pay millions of dollars of damages.
As if we did not have enough problems at home, Deutsche Bank, caught up with a giant in the field of his past in the US: the Frankfurt institution is in one of the creditors 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage leaves.
The regulator of the financial market, the NCUA accused of a number of big banks, to lead the Cooperative Bank false promises to purchase financial products; that the risk of a cut.
Such papers have lost during the crisis significantly in value and tearing down the bank into the Abyss.
`` We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue, but it was necessary to the drag on the court, ''said the spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank offset any blame.
This is also true for Citigroup, which has agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President of the NCUA Debbie Matze welcomed the willingness of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the cooperative banks in the US and helps out in bankruptcy, to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to obtain compensation for the damage in the billions.
Now closed settlement are the first of their kind.
The regulator is also set to other velkobanky and in the summer he sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the dubious mortgage leaves the so - called Mortgage - Backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the US real estate bubble around in 2007, it happened to a number of financial firms fatal.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis has changed the US - Investmentbank Lehman Brothers their thinking.
Even if the events occurred several years ago, now the banks to meet the wind.
Investors and the supervisory authorities have submitted numerous actions to achieve redress or hit the misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It complains that 18 international velkobankám that two state of american financiers dealing with the real estate of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the shops with mortgages in the volume of about $200 billion to disadvantage.
Also, Deutsche Bank must face the FHFA, there is a more stores in total about $14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The oversight office is required to Frankfurt institution was responsible for the `` substantial losses '', without giving an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank declined as unfounded, and said he wants to defend.
Warren Buffett comes with 10 billion into IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in it - for IBM.
Since March, bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
Yet significant american investor Warren Buffett has always claimed that he will not be in the field of it and computers to invest, because of the long - term development of firms have difficult to predict.
Now, however, he read a report, IBM and its opinion on investments in the business has changed.
Long before then had to understand that IBM offers mainly services and computer systems for it - the other businesses.
Warren Buffett 's investment in the financial world considered to be knighted.
As a result it may call the base rock pushed it IBM now `` IBM ''.
As Buffett told in America 's economic radio station CNBC that from March bought shares of IBM in the value of 10.7 billion dollars.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway has become as one of the largest shareholders of IBM, with shares of 5.5 percent.
Buffett sagte that IBM has nothing on his involvement did not know.
He praised Management, who struggled for the economic crisis, even the ordinary income.
`` You have done a great job, ''said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM is not for a long time on the lucrative it - services such as the operation of computing centers.
More than 100 - year - old pioneer computers also offers software and consultancy and powerful computers for businesses.
Buffett 's tech companies to date.
Claims that only investing in companies whose activities also means.
Instead, he reached after Buffett freight rail, the producers of lubricants or for the products of the machines.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns next to about 80 of its subsidiaries also shares in a number of velkokoncernů as Coca - Cola or Munich Re, former Münchener Rück.
The 81 - year - old man was taken over in the 1960 s of the last century, a textile firm, Berkshire Hathaway, and built a wise investment, one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet it is his way of life of modest.
It is, therefore, for many investors around the world, the cult figure.
His almost unerring sense of making money brought him the nickname `` Orakel from Omaha (a miracle of Omaha ''.
When Buffettova investment became known, increased shares of IBM before the opening of the stock market on the one percent.
`` Big Blue '', as it is called, IBM has on the stock market, the total cost of more than 220 billion dollars and is held together with Apple and Microsoft as the most valuable technology companies in the world.
In the company of Microsoft, Buffett, but he did not want to get in.
The founder Bill Gates is said to be his friend.
The threat is real
After the discovery of `` cells in Zwickau ''are questioning the turkish media on the state.
The paper says even the `` bloody ideology '', which is now again to come back to life.
The murder of eight small businessmen of turkish origin and one greek in 2000 to 2006 were right wing extremist background.
In this report are in Turkey and the inside of the german - turkish population in Germany reacted with fear and anxiety.
As for many of the german Turks to the back of the specter of which was long considered dead: from arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has not been a comparable violence with the right wing extremist background.
That in Germany there is xenophobia about it yet, there was never any doubt.
The right wing extremist network, however, range, which long ago can not see.
`` To come back to life again bloody ideology? ''read the headline of Internet edition of the turkish newspaper Haberturk. ``''
`` ''The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, point out that one of the perpetrators should be secret police agent for the protection of the Constitution, and they fear that the german authorities may be involved in a radical right wing swamp.
He said the turkish community Germany: remembering this weekend demonstrations silence before Brandeburskou gate victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks before she remembered the turkish community in Berlin, together with the german and turkish policy of the act 's 50 th anniversary of the german - turkish agreement on recruitment.
In bright colours was staged a common life - as the history of success.
As a rebuke to operate here coverage of several turkish media: `` a gift of Germany to now ''is the title of the article in the turkish online platform `` Haber x'', which reports on the background of the series.
Also the issue of the `` Hürriyet ''for Germany to take that out of contact.
`` It begins to smell '', is the headline in the post from Ahmet Külahci.
It points out that they were murdered by the people who pay taxes, and his work is an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
I discussed in německotureckých internet forums procedure, the police and her late success in the search.
Why did the german authorities have much earlier, after a suspicious looking in the right wing extremist circles, the authors.
So many of the shows at least rhetorically ready to drastic measures: `` if it is to continue to operate so shallow, immigrants have nothing other than their own defense and armed. ''
`` It is perhaps the best self - defence ''.
`` The quality of the arguments and the adequacy of the punishment of the whole network depends strongly inner peace in Germany '', says the `` selenium''.
What does this mean, if it 's inner peace in Germany at risk, explain the bombings in Solingen Mölln and in the 1990 s.
Photos of the burning in Solingen is deeply etched in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
Since no other event showed up here the Turks living more clearly that there is a tangible threat and the Germans, distrust and an interval may result in the right - wing violence
But the attacks have taken on the part of the Turks a clearer sense of reciprocity.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the turkish press was particularly criticised the failure of german politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to those in Mölln, who survived, to visit.
After arson attack in Solingen sent a telegram of condolence to the president, but at a festival in Cologne represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus KINKEL - KINKEL in his speech he calculated what charges the Turks were giving.
Quite so, as if the man was at the height of his taxes.
The current turkish news media shows, once again, how deep the distrust many german Turks in the polities.
In addition to extensive clarification and a new assessment of the extreme right wing of terrorism in Germany this time it requires open words.
Scandalous Bank in Lake Zurich
Yet the Bank of Europe does not have a seat in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered in the financial crisis almost went bankrupt, and since then glide from one crisis to another.
Now it has a German.
So the Axel Weber certainly think so.
After his noisy departure from his leadership of the Federal Bank happened in July known that taking 2013 to almost as spectacular new job: President of the Management Board of the Swiss velkobanky UBS - and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber, the forward publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired the solidity and said the remarks towards future colleagues.
`` Die UBS had a turnover. ''
`` I look forward to working with Kaspar Villigerem and Oswald Grübelem ''.
But in September, it was clear that everything will turn out differently.
One dealer from UBS in London went all the safety systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billion euros wasted.
The board of directors of UBS, Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, the respected banker, he had to leave.
The president of the board of UBS has since also stunned - and they all ask: where does Axel Weber?
It became known that Mr Weber bank since February 2012 may advise.
The Presidency of the Council and the government takes over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday said.
For Axel Weber that will be hard.
It is not a banker, a professor of economics, and the issuance of a banker, would have time to incorporate the needed.
Once he takes over responsibility for the bank 's strategy, which was once again proved that deserves the title of `` the bank' s biggest scandals in Europe '
As UBS 's, on the other hand, a great - until recently was the largest asset manager in the world - and sliding, on the other hand, had for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, is proud of the swiss bank spared.
It began in the financial crisis.
In 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent, and a solid, but also a trustee combines with the ambitious objectives: I also mean something in investment banking.
So managed by UBS 2007, on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more money for wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, refer to it as the investment bank in the league of the world 's largest banks
It made an impression.
The former banker and a longtime professor of banking in Zurich Hans Geiger says: `` my students at UBS, always as a model of good banks. ''
`` From today 's perspective, people ask: how I could be so wrong? ''
He was wrong.
In 2007, for the first time, it was clear that something has gone wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year has resigned, surprisingly, the boss of the Board of directors Peter Wuffli, who has not been seen as a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker.
A few months later, I do not know why he left.
The investment bank division has wasted subprime - Papíry and had to write off billions.
To that end, UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of really 13 billion francs.
But actually find investors, but such, recently had her: opaque asian state fund from Singapore and an arab state fund, which was so discreet that you do not know his name.
But it was only the first crash.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The bank had to admit new billions in losses, the President of the Management Board of Marcel Ospel, 2006 is still the second best - paid directors of Switzerland, has resigned.
In October 2008 there was a disaster: UBS was due to bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse, and had to be rescued by the state.
Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on mandatorily convertible bonds, which could become a co - owner of the bank.
Throughout the whole of Switzerland was shaken - because, as it is dramatic for a small country, as he has on its territory, so the big banks.
After all, the balance - sheet UBS 2007 more than five times greater than the performance of the economy of Switzerland (see picture).
`` Once again we could not save UBS '', says banking expert Geiger.
The disaster is the second.
In the last few months, it has surrendered UBS in a tax dispute with America and its willingness to the issue of data of wealthy clients who, as far as possible, with the help of the banks passed the tax.
In addition, she agreed to pay 780 million dollars - as the return of the profits from these transactions, including the parking charges.
It has been subjected to UBS more or less openly that helped by cutting taxes.
At the same time, lost something that has always been its capital in the competition for the rich clients: a halo of discretion.
After this scandal has already been the swiss bank secrecy that, as before.
There followed the resignation of Chairman and President of the Management Board.
And an exodus of customers' money.
So the bank lost in the course of a few months, his credibility in the central business areas: in the investment banking because of poor speculation and property management for helping to reduce taxes.
And just when it was again a little comfort, just as it was thought that UBS is once again, here comes this unfortunate commercial quest: one dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank saw that something is wrong.
And it is clear: with the management of risk in the investment banking it probably still is not working.
`` A case that Adoboli had revealed that the control of risk has changed too little, ''says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Finanz bank of the Institute of the University of Zurich.
Also, the financial director of the big german banks is certain: `` the problem of UBS is that they can not control the risks. ''
It was not exactly the idea of caution with which the swiss bankers started a long time ago, to become the capital of the world: not too much of a risk, but the safety for money - also from this side of the Alpine Republic collapsed again the world.
The swiss banks have become a symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high - quality chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich is more suited to a good swiss private bank - it 's just a little bit more.
Now the position is a classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the lake, which is backed by the swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, lettings business is one of the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany 's was found between the swiss traditional business as an ice cream parlor Sprüngli.
Already, over the centuries, it is the swiss banks: from the Nationalbank over Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
In the lobby, UBS will enter the heavy the revolving door.
Inside the walls are lined in marble, a large leather chairs, in addition to the logos of the bank 's big direction for `` safe ''.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss Bank both swiss velkobanky, UBS and Credit Suisse but sometimes - suppressed or betrayed, as is the boss of one small swiss private bank.
His name would prefer not to read in the papers, he concluded, as all of the swiss bankers, also with both velkobankami shops.
UBS is probably too grown, notes - particularly in investment banking, where he also expanded the Anglo - Saxon.
The Swiss, they do not have anything to say.
`` And if not, they adapted to long Anglo - Saxon ways. ''
Indeed, it was the Anglo - Saxon investment banking, which UBS has changed, gave her first high profits and then disaster: no european financial institution had not lost in the jungle around subprime as much money as Schweizer Großbank.
October 15, 2008 was a disaster.
`` In the center of a government coalition of small sedmimilionové country on the rescue operation in the history of the nation '', says the author Lukas Hässig in his book `` Der UBS - Crash''.
To 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euro accepted by politicians to rescue from bankruptcy standing velkobanku.
How could this happen?
If the talks with the swiss bankers, so you can see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three swiss velkobank within the group.
The bank, which is already on the merger was too big for a small Switzerland - and still continue to grow.
It helped that the two different bank predecessor UBS complement: a rich, but sleepy bank in Zurich in the management of the property and the poorer, but internationally strongly involved.

The massacre at a personal level
An emotionally powerful new book, Peter Englund, the beauty and the sorrow: non - history of the First World War (the beauty and the Sorrow: an Intimate history of the First World War) begins as a long list of prominent figures, it will make your head spin.
One of the Council, as he maintained: carefully this page and make a bookmark.
With all the people in the story of Mr Englund very well, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a beacon - in the moments when, as well as the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr Englund 's swedish historian and journalist.
It is also the new deputy to the Swedish Academy, which grants awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book, which is fun, it 's a very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite correctly pointed, as `` an anti - historical work ''.
It contains a number of well - known names, major contracts or famous battles, in contrast to her almost missing the ambassadors, energetic, journalists, and the debate about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, explains the author, as `` a book about what it was ''is mainly about ``. feelings, impressions, experiences and moods''.
`` The beauty and grief ''in the combination of war experiences 20 more or less common men and women, on both sides of the barricades, from students and botanists until after the climbers, doctors, the driver 's emergency vehicles and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, they lose limbs, or die.
Their lives are flaring as flames blazing in church - new is added to a patchwork of fates, while others died.
The book Mr Englund, from conventional historical novels is different.
The idea that the first world war was only a horrific trench fighting on the Western Front.
`` The beauty and grief ''deftly explores other places, where there was a war drama: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book deals with problems with the fall of bee nests, must spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids, or are faced with the presence of the tsetse flies.
Almost from the beginning to the very touching reading.
The war in the lives of people like a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina, stinking of gunpowder.
When, in the distance, the firing of guns and you are a woman who is at home with their children, or stay?
Who 's coming?
Almost no one did not understand what was going on, even in this, why was the war.
`` The vacuum arising from the lack of facts, ''Mr Englund, `` was filled with speculation, the hopes, fears and prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams and nightmares and rumors.''
`` The beauty and grief ''follows the stories of individuals, such as Florence Farmboroughová, an english nurse in the russian army, and Richard Stumpf, the young sailor serving in the german fleet.
Their stories are all taken from curricula, letters and other already published materials.
Descriptions of their lives may sound scary and fascinating, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details are absolutely living and believable.
Many of these deals with the suffering and dealing with him.
In the story of a german student author says: `` substitutes, everywhere the substitutes. ''
`` Coffee substitute, imitation of aluminium, imitation crepe paper, bandages, wooden knobs. ''
Going further, describes the substitutes for food in Germany.
He mentions `` meat made from compressed rice cooked in a sheep fat (and accompanied by a bone of wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato skins, boots with wooden soles ''.
It argues that there was a `` 837 registered substitutes meat in the production of the hot dogs and 511 registered substitutes coffee ''.
Some of the stories are about honour and courage.
One American in the internal incentives for violence and brutality, and then the war declared: `` in the end, you will understand that, because that 's human nature, not sitting in a comfortable chair with a cigarette and whiskey, the evening newspapers or a good book and pretend that this is a mask of civilization, and that is for the stiffly in me is not a barbarian. ''
Conversely, a british soldier is aware that, with the greatest likelihood of death and no one would notice, let alone to mourn.
`` When you finally accepted that he would, at least, that it happens in front of a grateful audience, ''he writes.
Instead, however, seems like a `` man who secretly hanged. ''
Other remarks concerning the retirement of the old Europe and the advent of new horrors.
`` The conflict is increasingly becoming an economic competition and competition, ''says Mr Englund, `` the war between factories.''
He caught it, what he calls a `` new kind of the new century, articulate and an ideological foe of a serial killer in the clothes of who their bloodshed carried out without getting up from the table. ''
The people were quite unexpectedly, the villainous alternates with heroism.
Mr Englund describes the soldiers, who is from prostitutes deliberately tried to catch a venereal disease, in order to avoid the service at the front.
`` Grotesque example of this behavior was trading gonokokovým pus, that the soldiers were buying and plastered with his genitals, in the hope that you will end up in the hospital, ''he writes.
`` The most desperate it rubbed into his eyes, which is often come to the end of my life. ''
In this translation of the Swedish from Peter Graves' s prose Mr Englund swing, but not spectacular, which, to his human subject admirably.
In dozens of small outputs captures the way in which the war `` a totally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred ''.
People are beginning to ask, why is their leaders to fight.
The best books of the First World War, mostly rather than with a complex story worked with hints of, for example, `` the First World War and the modern memories ''from Paul Fussella or novels like `` all Quiet on the Western Front'' from Erich Maria Remarquea.
Mr Englund prefers the conventional.
His book has the most overwhelming conclusion, which in popular literature is unprecedented.
I told him.
You will, however, seems to be, it was as if the author of books, you page of a list of heroes from his hand and lit it.
After the previous mistake this time to the minute planned raid
In hundreds of police officers, some in their helmets used in the street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because it would have been almost empty Zuccotti Park.
The action did not one but several high - ranking officers. other was first told that this was a training exercise.
At the forefront of the action, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence underscored how many problems to the police department in the operation.
May not be repeated cases of recent weeks, which, for example, to the use of pepper spray against the demonstrators, in violation of the rules of the department, and a wave of public sympathy flowed to the squatters.
Therefore, the police operation, which was to clear the protesters from Zuccotti Park, opened up after two weeks of meticulous planning and exercises.
The leaders are inspired by operations undertaken in other cities.
A massive exercise in case of conduct in crisis situations in parts of the Randalls Island, which was preparing to try in Zuccotti Park.
The leaders of the so - called training for riot - counter - terrorism measures including a rapid transfer of a large number of police officers - with a focus on the part of the City of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move into the park were literally `` at the last minute, ''said someone who was action originally explained only as `` exercise''.
`` I know a couple of police officers, who were in this action also called upon, and certainly no one said, that 's going to Zuccotti Park, ''said the person, who spoke only on the condition that he remain anonymous.
`` That 's going to Zuccotti Park, a senior member of the department. ''
One of the grounds of secrecy was a lesson that has the city.
14 October were the city 's leaders in the park clean, but then backed away from the plan, because as soon as he heard about him protesters swarmed them before the start of the operation to park hundreds.
On Tuesday 's actions involved officers from the various units, including response teams from all around - dozens of police officers, who are normally used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of delinquency.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day in the park comes and goes, a large number of people, so one o 'clock in the morning was an ideal time, when the action started.
`` It was appropriate to do it at the time, which will be in the park as few people as possible, ''he said.
Before the troops heading, lined on the streets of Pike slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks with arc and loudspeakers.
The lights and recorded a message from the speakers, many of the protesters.
When they entered the park to the members of the police units in their blue windbreakers, many of the demonstrators packed up his things and left.
Police say that until 1: 45 in the morning with the touch of a single tent, the protesters time to gather their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering at the edge of the park to get, if it were needed to make an arrest.
The reporters were forced to leave the park.
The Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne said that it was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, takes the view that the police want them to prevent their units in action, and in addition to some of the police rude.
Mr Brown said that the tv trucks on Church Street along the western border of the park without problems.
The police moved west and a thick tangle of personal items of protesters, including luggage and plastic bags filled with clothes for her teams from the health department, which immediately get everything in the park 's left.
Some of the demonstrators, who refused to move, they were out of the park. describing the images appeared moments later on the Internet.
A group of protesters took refuge in the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which was near the center of the park.
Some have created a roadblock and police launched their methodological arrests.
Ten people in the center of camp to each other.
And two people are tied to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Members of the emergency services were called to cut the locks.
Until 3: 30 in the morning in the park, there have been no arrests, said Mr. Kelly.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the sound of the police.
Mr Brown said that in the park were detained by the approximately 142 persons.
Most of the arrests took place on the grounds of `` the riots and resisting arrest, ''he explained.
The senior police officer at the scene of the action was Joseph J. Esposito, the commander of the Police Department, the highest - ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was personally involved in also Phil T. Pulaski, chief of detectives in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but `` in the management of the operation, ''said Mr Brown.
The second group of police officers waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between the streets of Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was needed, that we need to call on.
On the street Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on the street Pine Street, a block south of the park, have been erected roadblocks.
Of these places, the police moved the further from Zuccotti Park.
At one point they were police officers, many of whom have been equipped with shields, as crowds out people even further behind this limit.
On the northern border was about 28 people.
Some of the wildest events of the night were just south of the park.
About five o 'clock in the morning was spotted one of the south of the Pine Street, jumped on the hood of the car, and a few others, who let the air out of the tires of a police van.
At one point in the crowd out a piece of plywood.
At the end of the operation was in hospital, one police officer and one of the protesters.
The trade union support staff will sue the city for release
Unions representing hundreds of school support staff, who last month lost a job, in the center of the plan to sue the city. argues that the release was not necessary and it was a matter of discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on schools, attended by the poor students.
The litigation is likely to be the last resort, which the unions in the field of District Council 37, left, in their efforts to reverse the decision to release.
The 7 th October lost work six hundred and seventy two school aides, parent coordinators and other members of staff, who were among the worst - paid employees of the city of their release, the head of the union members described as revenge of the city for him last spring, access to health care fund managed by the work crews, by which the city wanted to patch a hole in the budget.
The city 's leaders this charge flatly refused.
At a meeting of the City Council, which was held last month, said the education minister Dennis M. Walcott, that the release was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately countered that, in the budget is not specifically mentioned on the release of the support staff.
Leaders of the city of District Council 37, announced that they have already made the necessary documents and warned of the Ministry of Education, that it will sue. in the middle of a press conference, where formally notified of the action in a state court in Manhattan.
The two defendants in the trial, Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the claimant 's eight laid - off workers, all of whom are afroameričany or hispanic males, as well as most of the other assistants, who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city, said that the city still claim, and therefore to the indictment will express.
According to the complaint, which was obtained by the New York Times, the unions have focused on the number of redundancies in the poor parts of the city, which wants to support its claims about the injustices of the negotiations. he had the view that the poor school more assistants, because they are already denied sufficient financial resources.
They point out that while in schools in parts of Staten Island, the layoffs at all, and in parts of the Upper East Side, in Brooklyn, in a part of the District 23 in Brownsville came on the work of the 17 school assistants and in parts of the District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx was released even 46 assistants.
Recalls that in school, Public School 36 in Harlem lost the work of five of the eight assistants, even though it is a school, where 68 percent of students live in poverty in the lawsuit says: `` it 's not a neighborhood full of parents who can provide funds to cover the deficit in the budget. ''
The budget of the School of Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent and the school also lost money, when the city changed the way of calculating the bonus of finance for the poor student.
The union also claims that the directors of secondary schools could be confused by the way it was written document authorising the release of parent coordinators.
In the document was to describe the actions of the use of the word `` excess '', i. e., to abolish the position, although this word is more often used to describe the removal of teachers on the payroll of the school to a database of available workers, whose salary is paid by the central authority.
`` Sixty - six of parent coordinators have been released, ''says in the complaint, `` and not only moved into the database for the position of the workers.''
The mission is over, the Congress is ready to accept the agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress to agree on something that concerns the uprising in Libya.
Before that, however, must have the revolution to succeed, for a long time, the reigning dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of the units of the United States closed.
On Tuesday, the Commission for the international relations of the Senate to decide on the statement, which supports President John Kerry (Mass.) with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which should congratulate the Libyans to their successful revolt and U. S. forces to thank for the `` bravery ''.
`` This declaration to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya, who began with the conversion of their country, ''said Kerry.
`` Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic aspirations. ''
The sentence may seem innocuous, but no debate on Libya, and has not been easy.
During the summer, lawmakers from both parties that even with the White House on the wording of a statement for approval or rejection of the military, the role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain resolution authorizing the limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of different views of both political parties, so that the Senate would never vote.
However, the same day, when he was in the House rejected the proposal, the House rejected the measure, which would stop the funding of U. S. operations in Libya.
The U. S. mission in Libya was literally in the legislative purgatory - Congress has criticised the way in which President Obama mission control, but its members apparently unafraid of so much to him in his actions stopped support.
The hesitancy of Congress finally passed another event.
The rebels took Tripoli in August and October 20, was killed by Qaddafi.
The mission later officially ended on 31 October.
It is now the Senate might be ready to act.
The Commission for international relations, in its statement `` congratulates the residents of Libya for their tremendous courage and admirable tenacity, which invested in an effort to free his people ''and `` commends the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and its allies, who were involved in the operation to protect the libyan population, for the extraordinary bravery and professionalism.''
The declaration also `` confirms the national interest of the United States to a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya. ''
The new proposal for the full support of the Commission for international relations, or legislators will be divided into two halves, as it was in the approval of the June draft?
The latest version of the set of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the chief prosecutor of the Republican Party in the Commission.
Lugarův spokesman on Monday said that the final version of the new proposal as yet.
In the House, will this week to vote on an amendment to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, led by Bob Goodlattem (Va.), will be the First Amendment to the Constitution of the budget or any other issue, which will vote for the House or the Senate.
Other lawmakers, despite the considerable efforts have not yet managed to push through its proposals to the vote.
Goodlattův proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution, which were introduced in Congress and a wide variety of topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and Senate - and others are only slight variations of the other.
Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of a balanced budget amendment and a handful of others who would like to `` regulate federal spending ''.
Some of the proposals are not the same, but their supporters - particularly from Republicans, who want to improve the reputation - can boast of their `` author ''.
The yield on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, would require the addition of a balanced budget vote, the House and the Senate.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non - binding statement in support of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget he wants a few members of the discussion of the limitations of the period in which the members of Congress to serve, while Jose E. Serrano (N. Y.) wants to increase the number of the period, which may be in the office of the president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of amendments, which would, among other things, to ensure the right to a good education and medical care.
A proposal remains an amendment to ban marriage to same - sex couples and the amendment prohibiting the burning of the national flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the annulment of federal laws in the case that, two - thirds of the states.
Although it appears that members of Congress in the design of the various amendments very active, compared with previous years, however, have not significantly exceeding the average.
In the 111. Congress offered 77 amendments, while in the 100 th Congress was 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison with the beginning of the 1990 s, when, according to the statistics of Senate library members offered every two years, more than 150 amendments.
They were not, however, much more successful than the current politicians.
The last amendment, which was added - 27 supplement - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed to Congress in 1789.
`` Beat up, but not defeated, ''Gifford said in his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after her from the immediate vicinity of the injured his shot at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffordsová (Ariz.) on Monday evening, appeared on national television, she sang together with music from the Broadway show `` the Sun Will Come out Tomorrow ''and said that more than a return to Congress wanted to be cured.
Giffords appeared on `` 20 / 20 ''at the station ABC News with Diane Sawyer. showed that the sentences she still has trouble, and he needed help.
The show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of the injuries caused by a bullet that her in front of his skull, through the left side of the brain, and at the back of her left.
Three months ago, surprisingly, she returned to the House of Commons, to triumphantly took part in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the January shooting in which six people were killed and 13 others were wounded, Giffords smiling, laughing and singing - and his recovery, described as `` difficult ''.
When Sawyer asked how she felt, Giffords forty - one - year - old said: `` quite well. ''
The interview with Giffordsovou and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one - hour special, the `` 20 / 20 '', which was broadcast on the eve of the release of a new book, the couple called `` Gabby: a story of hope and courage''.
Special watched the entire convalescence Gifford from firing on 8 January.
In the video, filmed Kelly during the first week, is to see Giffords in the hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across his forehead.
While her husband is encouraging, not at that time, more than just one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords, sitting in a wheelchair and therapists taught her how to perform simple activities.
A nod of the head.
Vyšpulení lips.
And then, her first word: `` what. ''
In a few days, Giffords said another word - `` toast '', as he demanded changes in their breakfast.
Video - ABC show that the central role for recovery Giffordsové music: Congresswoman on them singing along to a therapist to the tune of the song `` Girls Just Wan na have fun ''from Cyndi Lauper and `` Free Fallin ''' from Tom Petty.
During the interview, Gifford, which gives two hours daily therapy, Sawyer said that from the day of the shooting, he can not remember anything.
Her husband said that Gifford read newspaper articles about the shooting until 12 March, when he first asked who she was six, who was killed in the incident.
The shooting is the suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a prison in Missoury, where under the influence of forcibly administered drugs awaiting trial.
`` Too many people have died, ''said Giffords Sawyer.
`` Terrible, terrible, terrible. ''
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point his wife during her recovery, she said: `` I lost. ''
`` So I just said, Gabby, you lose, ''said Kelly.
`` You have just got beat.
But you can get together and come back even stronger than ever before. ''
Military units are confronted with compassion rather than with respect
The event was the gala on Wall Street, which made millions of dollars for war veterans in New York, who do not have a roof over his head.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of helplessness, frustration and a loss.
Gathered around him hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.
They dressed the crowd stood and applauded.
`` The men and women serving in the military were regarded as heroes, ''said David Saltzman, who spring benefit.
The first night was then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, it was in place, and Admiral Mike Mullen, however, saw the role of military units somewhat differently.
`` All of them were introduced as some orphans, ''the officer wrote in an e - mail.
I am sure that the organizers meant well.
I know that, yes.
But what I saw was not respect. it was a pity.
So completely the opposite impression only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the american public.
The army 's bezbřeze included praise for his victims.
But this praise, saying soldiers.
The public is increasingly behaves as if people in uniform.
`` We are not victims, ''said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
`` But it seems that the only way we can do some support, is to put us in the role of the unfortunate souls. ''
This issue is very sensitive for the military commanders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or a public relations, which we need.
They also recognise that anger, with troops returning once from Vietnam, was much worse.
The result is that most of the words of regret is spoken quietly and privately among veterans of the war.
When the two sons of the retired Colonel Mark Canciana returning from combat, where they served as a member of the Marine Corps, warned of their father, the service will be people outside the military look from two angles.
From the point of view of some will feel respect and awe, because they defeated enemy insurgents and visited the exotic places.
Another but will be wondering if the `` beneath the surface of the ill, a veteran, ''said Cancian, who was part of the fighting in Iraq and the return of the took place in Washington in the government.
He claimed that when looking for work, so some people who do the interviews, he suggested that so soon after returning to the fight can withstand the stress, which is associated with the work in Washington.
`` When you talk about their service, you must expect a negative reaction, ''said the Cancian their sons.
Concern about the army partly stems from the american indifference to the wars.
Success on the field of battle rarely win recognition in the country, which is to own a small army of awareness and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is located just a few of his own benefit.
`` As a nation already for the Army 's heroics, as was the case during the Second World War, ''said Lieutenant General David Barna, who commanded U. S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition by the politicians and the public focused mainly on the suffering of men under arms.
The soldiers are excelling in the number of actions, which endured, the many friends who have lost, or the extent of his injuries.
The Army is facing growing pressure to crack down on the use of rape
This week to decide whether will begin the process of 28 men and women against the army because of an alleged failure in the case of rape.
If not, they are prepared to bring the action of the hundreds of other applicants.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was in the night, when she was allegedly raped by her colleague from the Army, 25 years and was in the 11 th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008, and she was heading to the barracks on Air Station Miramar, north of San Diego. after dinner with a friend on their male colleagues, carrying a box of 12 beers.
Asked if he could join them, that would be in her room for a drink.
`` In my head, a warning light, ''she described Lymanová.
But a native Texan her objections were ignored.
I thought: no, he 's 19.
`` He 's from Texas, ''she said.
`` I wish I listened to my instincts. ''
Claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, the man walked, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, 18 November, will be Lymanová and 27 other current or former members of the military to wait for the verdict of the hearing, which could have a historic impact. it will be happening in Arlington, Virginia, and it is about whether the allegations against a former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, he will have to appear in court.
The indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld had failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The accusation was in February, a Washington lawyer, Susan Burke and the plaintiff had 17 members. over the coming months, however, the number has grown to 28 - 25 women and three men, who all say they have been raped or otherwise sexually attacked by his colleagues in the army, and the army after the announcement of the weft of failed in the investigation, the punishment of any pursuit of justice.
Burke says that going after a senior commanders of the army, because the problem starts right for them.
`` The army is obligatory system, ''he says.
`` Who are the people who are in a position to prevent the introduction of measures against such action? the chain of command. ''
Burke also alleges that from February contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of them could become part of a further action in the future.
Her strategy: rather than to group all the charges in this case - put all its eggs in one basket, as she said - to bring in a number of different cases, if need be, to pressure eased.
A team of defending the Defense Ministry leads the Attorney General of the United States Neil MacBride, who, together with his colleagues gave rise to the dismissal of the case.
Court documents obtained by Newsweek, discuss the strategy of the defence - in essence, that current or former soldiers, the army can not sue for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the regulation of the Supreme Court of the 1950 s called as the Feres Doctrine is not the federal government responsible for the injuries sustained by soldiers on active duty.
`` The alleged injuries related to the military service of the plaintiffs, ''the document says.
The Ministry of Defence is on this matter has refused to comment.
However, things have changed since the 1950 s.
Although women still officially may not serve in the fight, it 's just a quibble: in modern wars, hard to find the right of the front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have played teams of female soldiers increasingly prominent role, especially in the field of communication with civilian women in a war zone.
The result: between the wars fell 150 soldiers of the female sex - two - thirds of them directly in the fight.
It is time to the modernisation and the military, explains Burke.
In their struggle is not alone in addition to her are dealing with the case of three other legal representatives.
In law school Yale drawn visitors - a seminar on legal action on four main military academy for the development of the atmosphere of promoting hatred for women.
Regardless of the non - profit organization of America Vietnam veterans gathering evidence for its claim headed against the army. this action is in line with the diagnosis of a `` personality disorder '', which was allegedly found in the victim of rape, in order to have the military an excuse for their release, according to activists, such as anal Bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women 's Action Network, a perfectly normal practice.
The group already in December brought an action against the organisation for negotiations with veterans, which accuses of discriminatory practices, which should be in the processing of applications for assistance from people who said they were in the service of a sexually attacked.
In Congress launched nine separate proposals, a group of senators and members of both political parties and suggested in a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the prevention and resolution of sexual violence of the Ministry of Defence was in the year 2010 reported 3,158 sexual assaults.
This type of attacks remains, however, in most cases, unannounced and, according to its own estimates of the Pentagon this number represents approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19 000 incidents in a given year.
In a report issued in March is dismantled and the intensity of the prosecution of the suspects: in 2010 to get 20 percent of the cases reported in the army - which is half as opposed to the civilian criminal justice system.
The prosecutor in the case, Deputy Burke described the attacks as the first of a series of trauma.
Private First Class Lymanová, for example, reported the alleged rape of a military police less than an hour after it was made.
During the night, he says, was asked for details about his rape said 11 times to various members of the police, doctors and commanders.
Have all the necessary tests to determine the rape and in her bed was found in the blood of the attacker - from the wound, which made him on the arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, has completed Lymanová hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions on whether that on the day of the attack she loved with his friend.
The six people, as witnesses to the reputation to account for the benefit of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
`` I remember the day when he was a judgment, ''says Lymanová.
`` I had the feeling that, right there on the spot to - screaming, I ran out of the courtroom. ''
`` Put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I am his commanding officer said: it was not his court. my. ''
Lyman told to attend a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed personality disorder, which she described as unfit for duty.
In January 2010 was from the army without honor, and therefore not entitled to earn released.
Whatever the case, the Lymans and others sought to move on to the next phase or not, it 's a marathon, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law.
But, notes, `` from my point of view, they should be able to go to the next phase of the trial. ''
Between them and the verdict, however, is the doctrine, which was criticized by from the moment she saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is a few decades behind, because of their obligations to comply with the same degree of motivational incentives and deterrent.
Adds: `` the odds are heavily against them... but it is important for them to try it. ''
The change occurs only when good people willing to fight.
In the hearing decided in their favour, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, Burkevoá, collected hundreds of other people prepared to take action and to work on other causes of this topic.
`` We will not stop with the army in the fight, which is reformed, ''he says.
Or until we die, whichever came first.
The walls have eyes: how will the scientists examined on Facebook
Anders Behring Breivik has become the new face of right - wing extremism in Europe, was just another young man, who his anti - immigrant views presented on the Internet.
On Monday the Braivik, who confessed to the killing rampage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Despite Breivik could act alone, in cyberspace, certainly was not alone: during the attack, he spent a lot of time in front of the computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists in support of the right - wing groups on the social network.
After the tragedy of this summer, the scientists want to know more of these people.
But how to find them?
Easily - just go on Facebook.
`` We realized we get is, is not that hard, ''says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report of the british research team, which involved the European Digital populism.
Supply of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, that scientists were enough to simply take advantage of advertising on the site, and with absolute precision to determine the demographic group - something that marketers are doing it for years.
Bartlett 's team across Europe found half a million fans of the right - wing groups, and then to focus attention and sent them ads. however, instead of their through to the newly established group or a kind of diet products, urged them to fill out a questionnaire in which there were questions about their level of education, the violence and optimism due to their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 supporters of 14 different right - wing groups in 11 european countries - without it, so he had to leave office.
`` It 's a whole new way of conducting research, ''notes Bartlett.
Some of the results are not all that surprising: online followers of right - wing groups are mostly young men, which became an increasing level of immigration.
But on the other hand, `` those who its online activism combined with off - line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen. ''
The team 's work DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes the new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, medical scientists and researchers use the site to study everything from health problems and the social trends hiding under a status update, contributions to the walls and down `` like me ''.
The Facebook report more than 800 million active users. - each of them a day on average, with three different data, from the social network 's literally `` information supernova '', which is behind the development of many of the new research. number of academic work, in whose name is the word on Facebook, increased compared to the state five years ago to nearly 800%.
For some scientists is the magic of Facebook, in that it gives them a chance to study people without having to bother somewhere on the street.
`` Before, if you wanted to carry out a survey among the people of the British National Party, it was very hard to identify them. ''
`` You have to get to the parties, where would you but never allowed ''says Bartlett.
`` All this Facebook degrades - you just go directly to them. ''
Others argue that the site will be able to offer a way to identify the socio - health problem and avoid them.
In a recent study, Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that college students, most of his drunken outputs on Facebook, they were much more at risk of the problem of alcohol abuse than students who, on this subject.
Moreno, proposed to fellow students websites monitored and come up with the offer of help student who is too much of a status.
`` The problem can not be resolved, if it can not diagnose, ''said the Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, a co - author Dr. Moreno, director of the Center for Health, behaviour and development of children at the Children 's Research Institute in Seattle.
`` We have found a way to identify at - risk children who would otherwise not have had a chance to occur. ''
Facebook itself constantly probed the data of its users.
The information the team drew up the statistics on the context of relational statuses and on St. Valentine 's Day, turnout in 2010 and the satisfaction of the nation (mainly using the information to which they had access - advocates of Internet freedom have long claimed that the site had a treasure trove of information available for research and others).
But users of Facebook, they know that the page is watching, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the chance to play Scrabble with a friend of mine, which is thousands of miles away, is the need to provide the site of your personal information.
But what if the users of Facebook will become part of the research, which do not even know?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data off - line, on - line data, however, are available to everyone.
`` To me, the most users do not even think that scientists can peer into their profiles, ''says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006, carried out by using public Facebook wall of its students.
`` As for them, so that the information is only between them and their friends. ''
Consequently, it is also considered the question of methodology.
I research in the off - line, there is no guarantee that the body is completely honest.
Facebook 's can not verify, of how much of the information on the profile and contributions to the truth.
`` What you are saying on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, they are two completely separate things, ''explains Selwyn.
That 's why Selwin, who spent long years of research into new technologies, thinks that a pencil and notebook, and continue to remain the best possible tool that can be used in the research.
`` When you go into the real world and talk to real people, this is something that can not be replaced, ''he says.
`` Social research should be on society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still going on off - line. ''
`` Cold and inhuman '': Anders Behring Breivik participating in his first public court hearing
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to planning the two attacks, during which it was this summer in Norway killed 77 people, in his first public court hearing in Oslo himself described as a `` resistance ''.
`` I am the military commander in the norwegian resistance movement, and between the norwegian the Knights, ''he said before the court, where they gathered 500 people.
`` I object to the Court of Justice, because you mandate granted the organization promoting the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism. ''
`` I confess their acts, but for them not to blame. ''
The judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika during this monologue said, because `` he did not want to give Breivikovi opportunity to this hearing, used as a platform from which to voice their opinions. ''
For the same reason, said Breivikovi, which brought with him a prepared speech, at the end of the hearing to reach out to the relatives of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered the police to Breivika held in custody for 12 weeks, banned him any contact with the media for 4 nadsat and announced that the competent authorities will be for a period of eight weeks to complete control over all his visits and all correspondence.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope that they will be able to Breivikovi looked into the eyes of others, therefore, to be sure, that 's held firmly under lock and key.
They all took part in order to move the case to a speedy conclusion.
`` It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman, ''said the observer NRK, one of the survivors of the attack.
`` It was not nice, but for myself, I can say that, after what I saw and heard the suspect, I was mentally pushed back a little further. ''
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained throughout the hearing, calm and professional. on arrival and departure into the building without incident gaze of the journalists and the survivors in the eye.
Despite Breivik 's bizarre notion that is part of a larger movement `` resistance '', the judge decided that it is not crazy, and said that there is no evidence that he had an accomplice.
For some, it may be some consolation that the attacks on 22 June, appear to be the work of a single extremists and not a group of militants.
It does not diminish the grief and confusion, which are still in the minds and hearts of the nation.
`` I wish to get out as a monster, but it is not, ''said a relative of one of the victims.
`` If so, it would be a lot easier. ''
7 the lessons of the lost interview with Steve Jobs in the movie in cinemas this week
When Steve Jobs 5 October died, began to appear the views of the people who have compared with Henry Ford - and chose him for his genius, the largest modern inventor.
The recently rediscovered Jobsově interview, which was convenience for the film, which was released this week, it will be for all fans of Apple 's, the fact that his creative mind completely understand the business processes and work flows behind its products.
He was a wonderful designer, idealistic and self - appointed member of the hippie, but at the same time also pedantic organizer and man that every little thing goes into great detail - believed that many entrepreneurs are suffering from `` the idea that a really great idea is from 90 percent of their work... [but] between good and excellent the end product is still a long way to go and work. ''
In 1995, he worked Bob Cringely on tv the triumph of the computer, which dealt with the dawn of personal computing. during the filming took place in a unique, more than an hour - long conversation.
This time it is ten years since he was forced to leave the company Jobs of Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company NeXT, and looking as broad public acceptance of the Internet.
In the tv show was eventually used only a part of the entire Cringelyho conversation and about the original copies of the interview was said that was lost in transit.
Shortly after Jobsově death, however, were found in the VHS copies of the director 's garage.
It is this material, slightly clipped, forms the basis of the 68 minutes picture Steve Jobs: the Lost Interview, who is headed to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who was known for his distaste for the provision of a long conversation, Jobs is surprisingly enthusiastic, that may be talking about his philosophy of technological and commercial strategies.
And it also shows a very thoughtful man.
Four times in the course of the conversation, between a question and answer a long pause - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, which is seen as Jobs answer perfectly still, that was a short and precise.
There are also moments when, on the surface of the sails Jobsův perfectionism, when Cringelyho issues are impatient and encouraged him to get to the problems and issues.
The interview was filmed before the days of Pixaru, iPod or 'and appear in it eerily prophetic thoughts, when Jobs assesses, what does the rest of the company' s good and bad, and offers its own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It is one thing to study a posthumous evaluation Jobsovy career, but on Jobs, seen here as an earnest dreamer in the prime of his genius, is something raw and inspirational.
I have my own vision of how the case could and should look like.
It did not take long, and after his thoughts, he is also began to put into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes of the interview, which is worth noting:
How he learned to drive the company:
`` Over the years, I have always asked: `` why are you doing this? 'and the answer was always the same: well, that' s the way it is. ''
No one knows why he 's doing what he' s doing, never on matters relating to the business does not think in depth.
I found that out.
Jobs says that describes his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was confused by the way they were recorded costs - often began reading `` standard costs '', on their levels could only speculate. at that moment, decided to go their own way - developed an instrument that would guarantee that they could trade costs to determine within seconds.
How did the mischief on the Pope:
Jobs remembers the `` blue box '', which was built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allows people to hack into the phone company and free phone anywhere in the world.
The device that was written in the past have gone, but Jobsovo enthusiasm, when the blue box describes as an instrument of power, is literally contagious.
It tells how with Wozniak device tested using a pay phone and during the conversation, he left the transfer from one network AT &amp; T to another, while with the largest number of satellites.
`` At least half a dozen times we are like that - around the world, so when we then something called the pay phone, there was not a minute later on the phone at the door, ''laughs Jobs.
`` We were young and we found ourselves, we can build a case, which is capable of running the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world. ''
The two of them have made a little thing that could control the much larger giant - it was an incredible experience and I would not exist without her Apple.
Jobs is a description of a joke with Wozniak almost to the end. through the blue box in the middle of the night was summoned to the Vatican and to talk to the pope, as well as Henry Kissinger.
I called on the status of the members of the Catholic Church, in the middle of the night to talk with the U. S. diplomat, and it was not until just before the phone woke up and the Pope himself, with a pair of laughter and put the phone down.
As he fell in love with technology (and was on the phone with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12, and has been looking for spare parts to build Power, found in the number of Bill Hewlett and called him.
Not long after their 20 - minute interview was Jobs secured summer jobs in the company of Hewlett - Packard.
`` `` Incredibly has affected me. it was the only company, which at that time was recognized, and shaped my view of what the company is and how to treat their staff. ''
Jobs later became one of the employees at HP, who visited the company 's research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw `` the first desktop computer, which was ever produced ''.
It was the size of a suitcase, CRT monitor and I fell in love with it at once.
As a teenager I in HP moved higher and higher, hanging around the computer and began to write programs.
What makes innovation:
In a few places, Jobs during the conversation he speaks about how to invent new products on the run.
In the early days of his career, when he started to sell a printed circuit boards, one customer said that for him by a computer.
He had only paid 30 days, during which he had to invent, complete and deliver the cash facility.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in the development of the computer mouse:
`` I remember, we were quite fiercely fought... shouting at me, that it would take five years [a mouse, which would cost USD 300], when I got tired, I went out and found a designer. ''
Ninety days later, we were able to make perfectly reliable Mouse for $15.
How big companies out of breath:
Long before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs has predicted that many industrial leaders in their vision would falter and lose their share of the market.
`` Let 's just say that you are working for IBM or Xerox, so you are doing better copiers and printers, and what' s next? ''
Do you have a monopoly on the market, so that the company had the company could not be more successful.
At the moment it is ruled by a sales and marketing, so that firms run by people who are in charge of this, as the people in charge of their own products are out of the decision - making process.
Technological genius, who led the company to its solid position, is now replaced by people who have no idea about the good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge is essential.
That 's exactly what happened in the company of Xerox.
The company Xerox could own virtually the entire computer industry.
It could be ten times bigger than it is, could be the Microsoft of the 1990 s.
The victory, however, to create a defeat.
As he takes innovation as an art form:
`` Between good and excellent the end product is still a long way to go and a lot of work... and how the great idea develops, it will be changing and growing. ''
During that time, she will learn a lot.
You have to go to a number of compromises - some things simply electrons, glass, robots or factories do not make.
You have to remember always 5 000 things - different concepts - and put them together...
Finally, is a matter of taste - you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and, in a way, he 's trying to reflect on what they are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I have never been ashamed of it, it 's a good idea to steal.
The company Macintosh was so amazing, and successful, therefore, that the people who worked in it, they were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and it happened at the same time as the best computer scientists in the world.
If it had not been for computers and new technology could be amazing things in different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the law on health care at a time when their case in court
On the day when the Supreme Court held behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question of whether to accept the challenge to the law on health care, President Obama 's two of the justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended the dinner sponsored by the law firm, which will be before the court to take part in the negotiations.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine justices gathered to discuss the submitted proposals.
One of the direct experience of cases, the action was brought by 26 states are questioning the radical overhaul of health care, which last year approved by Congress - the law, which mobilized the conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed that action heard. in March is expected to 5, 5 - hour meeting, the outcome of which, moreover, even more agitated presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012, and at the time of the decision will be in full swing.
A lawyer who will stand up to the Court and will seek to achieve a rejection of the bill, will most likely Paul Clement, who served as the Attorney General of the United States under the leadership of George W. Bush.
Clementova law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies, which helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has long years in defense of conservative legal principles.
The company, which has sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade association calling the law, known as the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which they are in the process of a stake in the huge financial resources.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel for several hours after the debate on the topic of the incident.
He attended, in addition to the other, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and confirmed the law on health care.
And the marketing of the guests? Scalia and Thomas.
It is nothing new: this pair of judges to the Federalist Society attended for years.
And certainly not to do anything that would be contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, the judges released from the obligation to comply with the code of conduct, which are subject to lower the federal judges.
If not, it would be their behaviour was subject to the principle of C 4, which says that `` the judge may participate in events that are related and other organisations are taking in order to obtain funds, however, the judge may not be the speaker, a guest of honour, or may not be appearing on the programme of action. ''
However, the relationship Scalii and Thomas to two law firms - acting in the case, and also the company with a huge financial interest in this case, more than enough to alerted activists calling for ethics in government.
`` This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claims of some of the judges that the Supreme Court is under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges, ''said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
`` The judges were drinking and had dinner at a social lunch together with the legal representatives, who are waiting to be tried in a court of law. ''
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funding through this action undermines his feet all allegations of bias, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas against his critics have shown little understanding and told them that they also without problems combining their legal obligations with those groups, such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas' s wife, Ginni is a conservative activist.
The Conservatives also argue that the ethical problem is mainly of Justice Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan has worked as the Attorney General for the government of President Obama, when he appeared before the court of the first protests against the law.
Critics of the Kagan to push him to waive the participation of the case, and says that, at the time for the fight, so much so that now could be impartial.
Kagan seem to be preparing to resign.
The company Boeing has received a record contract for the jets in the $18 billion
The airline Emirates ordered 50 dvouuličkových jet aircraft, a Boeing 777 with an option to buy another 20.
The company also sells six Boeing Boeing Dreamliner airline Aman Air, which collects more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 of its products, most of it is no cause for celebration.
However, if the company aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is a record 18 billion, it is something else.
As well as an important message is that, where the company Boeing won the contract: the Middle East, expanding a gold mine for future orders for aircraft.
According to the forecast, issued on Monday, the Chicago company, estimates that the airline in the Middle East will be in the next 20 years will need 2 520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
The company Boeing on the weekend announced its biggest order in history, what concerns the dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 dvouuličkových jet Boeing 777.
The sensational contract came from the Emirates airline based in Dubai.
The company Boeing at the 2011 Dubai Air Show, that the airlines have the option to buy another 20 aircraft, which would be the total value of the contract climbed to 26 billion.
On Monday, then the company Boeing announced that the airlines Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787 - 8, sometimes known as the Dreamliner, which boasts a significantly better fuel consumption and facilities for passengers.
The total cost of the following six aircraft exceeds the USD 1 billion.
`` This is an excellent report for the whole company Boeing, ''said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
`` The quality of the customer is very high. ''
Many airlines in the Middle East is one of the nations of oil.
This means that not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices - the most detrimental to the airlines, because it is one of the largest costs - is so crucial, because the country itself to higher oil prices.
It is important, because it is not as likely as other airlines that could cancel or postpone orders for aircraft because of the increase in fuel prices, says Dihora.
`` They are as natural protection, ''he says.
The contract from the airline Emirates strengthens the position of the company Boeaing on the market with a wide body and brings to the company Airbus SAS, which had wanted to try to break the dominance of Boeing to its transport model, the A 350.
The victory of Boeing comes four months after representatives of Airbus announced that the deportation of the first flight of the A 350, which is a direct competitor to the 777 - 300 ER.
The deportation was, therefore, that customers are demanding more useful load aircraft and range, so he took the time to a machine to deliver more power engine.
The price of the Boeing Co has increased by 1.5% to USD 67,94.
The sister of Mexico 's president, was apparently michoacánských defeated in elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says that her opponent, Faust Vallejonovi from the PRI, helped in the search for the governor 's chair with drug traffickers.
It seems that the sister of Felipe Calderon in the violent state elections for governor in Michoacán loses. on Monday, subsequently said that one of her opponents to win back the drug dealers.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the gubernatorial election in the western state of Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
`` The intervention of the members of organized crime in the electoral process and especially in yesterday 's during the elections themselves is alarming, not only for the Michoacán, but for the whole country, ''said Luisa Maria Calderon in an interview on the radio, a day after Sunday' s elections.
`` They threatened to our candidates, members of the group for a survey of public opinion... they took the ballot box, built roadblocks... and leaving people to vote on an order for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when the Presidency.
Plans, however, a quick return to power and victory in elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win even in July in the presidential election.
It seems that Vallejo beat Calderonovou, which only the day before the election, only very close.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative side of his brother 's National Action Party, or Mr., refused to Vallejona recognised as the winner.
Third - ranked Silvano Aureolis, the candidate of the left - wing of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which is controlled by the governor 's office for squabbling and the party' s presidential election in 2012 on the very unfortunate failure.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the provisional results as valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital city of the state on behalf of Morelia, any kind of relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates for the recognition of the results.
Michoacán was long a period dominated by drug cartels specialising in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is the home state of President Calderon and just in Michoacán in December 2006, launched a military fight against traffickers.
The violence, however, survived.
The mayor of Mr., a supporter of Louise Marie Calderonové, was killed a week before the election, and many of the candidates from the election of fear.
But whatever the outcome of the election in Michoacán look for the PRI, the winning party will get a new momentum.
The representative of the PRI in presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, of Vallejo Wahingtonu congratulated and said: `` I think that this victory would be given to the coming year could be very encouraging. ''
Bank of the ADB calls on Asia, to help to save the eurozone
Bank of the Asian Development Bank called on China and India to be ready to help to rescue the euro zone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise, it could lead to an overall decline in the world economy, which would have a negative impact on the growth of the economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, director - general of the bank ADB, based in Manila, said that two of the fastest - growing economies in the world must `` do everything in its power ''to assist the rapid recovery of the currency bloc through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned of the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China] all the problems are `` too, ''and said that the asian financial aid in combination with the leadership and resources to help stave off the long - term, the collapse of the global economy.
`` We are all in this together. ''
`` So to anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis, ''he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
`` Asia is perhaps to some extent protected, but it certainly is not immune. ''
`` So if China and India can help, we should do. ''
The association is already several months severely tested a severe debt crisis.
In the last days of the borrowing costs of Italy dangerously increased and the heads of government of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised fears of the world economy back into recession, and there were calls to the newly prosperous the leading economies together and to help find a solution to the eurozone.
Mr. Nag predicted that all asian aid will be targeted by the IMF, but noted that the mutual aid - as the purchase of bonds to fund the bailout of the European Union, the institution of the european financial stability - the asian partners of european countries to provide more negotiating capacity.
Anand Sharma, India 's minister of commerce, said that `` India can do, ''to help the euro area, because of its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and dry up inflow of foreign capital.
`` No one wants to the eurozone remained fragile and unsettled, ''he said.
`` We are facing a difficult task, and we have to maintain a high level of growth. ''
`` It 's not about an alternative, it is a fact of life, because how else can we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women. ''
Others argue that emerging economies, such as, for example, the indian, have nothing to help european economies, when they are forced to confront their own severe economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to explain to aid for Europe 's 1.2 billion inhabitants of India, when 800 million of whom live on $2 or less a day.
`` One might find out that the Greeks goes to retire at 50, and you are taking on the beaches, which they may find it hard to explain, ''he said.
Lee Howell, director - general of the World Economic Forum, similarly, has questioned why they should be indian stocks used to keep well - paid jobs for many of greek citizens in a badly managed and loss - making sectors, such as rail transport.
Mr. Nag, pointed out that the crisis in the euro area is at risk of `` dangerous domino effect. ''
The Bank 's forecast that Asia will occur between 2011 / 2012 to 7.5% economic growth, now faces a `` risk of a downturn ''because of the threats.
He said that the vulnerable emerging markets must develop plans `` expenditure '', to be protected from the downturn, and the flow of capital from their economies.
The warning from the Pentagon on possible cuts in the defence
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress really put into the boiler, when he warned that the looming automatic cuts in the budget may pose a threat to national security and cause a financial chain reaction, beginning at the Pentagon and the continued over the battlefield in Afghanistan to the civilian assembly line.
The Pentagon will have already spend the budget reduction of $450 billion over the next ten years, but now fears the reduction of about 600 billion, if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
`` The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Resort, ''Panetta wrote in a letter to Senator John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and the so - called attachment to 23% drop in the standard and the suspension of the many new projects.
`` For such a huge reduction, used this premature manner, it will not be possible to make the most of our building or the ship 's projects - you can buy a three - quarters of a building or ships. moreover, it could lead to serious damage to the other modernisation effort, ''Panetta wrote the senators.
`` We will also urge separated many of our civil servants, and because it has a reduction in place so quickly, we will also have to almost certainly civilians forced to go on holiday, to be able to fulfill the requirements. ''
`` These changes may shake the faith of those who care about our army and cause serious damage to its readiness. ''
Finally, the cuts to touch upon the combat units, said Panetta.
`` Although the accounts for the financing of possible military operations overseas, this obstávka directly affect, the operation will be adversely affected by significant changes in other budgets, ''said Panetta.
`` There will be cuts even in the contracting personnel, which will result in a delay of a fixed contracts in support of the war effort of our people. ''
`` Reduced is paid staff, which would also delayed payments to suppliers and the consequent disruption of the legal and political support. ''
Both senators Panettovi ten days ago, asking for more details on the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
`` The consequences of obstávky at the Ministry of Defence could lead to the rapid degradation of the United States as the world 's great military power. ''
`` We are strictly against this tough measures, ''the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when Panettův published a letter.
`` It 's not the conclusion that can live, and it is certainly under it, we do not want to sign. ''
`` The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not let that happen. ''
`` It remains to be seen whether Panettův letter and a fresh warning to increase the pressure on Congress approving the budget and amplify voices calling for the Pentagon 's omission from the list of tightened areas.
Panetta was recently in talks about possible cuts to more and more open, even though he went on his high position in the Pentagon 's long years of experience to the approval of the budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew that he was getting tough fight.
At a press conference organised by the previous week, Defense Minister sketched a picture of what may be his Resort wait - shell of the army, in which, however, will miss the core.
`` It will be like a ship without sailors. ''
`` It will be like a brigade out of ammunition. ''
`` It will be like the Air Force without trained pilots. ''
`` It will be like a paper tiger, as an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission, ''Panetta said at the beginning of his speech at the Pentagon.
`` It will be like a unit without morals, ready and able to deal with a possible enemy. ''
`` The result will be a welcome aggression... ''
In the Annex supplied with the letter, McCain and Graham Panetta specifies how will have a reduction to result in `` significant operating risks: the late response to the crisis, the conflicts and disaster; a significant reduction in the drops and deployment around the world; the expected an unacceptable risk in future combat operations. ''
Panetta also said that some of the largest defense projects could wait for the closure, including those that are already being tested, even those that are still in the early stages of planning.
On the list was, for example, a project of the F 35, the planned new bomber, ballistic submarines of the new generation, the new coastal combat ships and a new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Marine Corps to replace the Humvee.
The suspension of further development and testing of the aircraft, the f - 35 would be over the next ten years would have saved 80 billion, but its proponents argue that it is a necessary next step in the improvement of the army, which is needed in order to deal with potential threats posed by China and other rivals.
How to tell a lie
A glance at recent headlines tells how serious and pervasive are lies and deception in day - to - day life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full with accusations that he sexually harassed a few women - both sides claim that the other is lying.
Administrators at the University of Penn State were accused of perjury, when he tried to hide it on record that the retired football coach sexually attacked the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy caught as running a microphone says the US president Barracku Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
A lie could destroy his career and shake the stability of many countries.
The New York congressman and web - based performer Anthony Weiner made a fool of myself, when the publication of the information, which was immediately refuted.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of misusing funds from his campaign to try to conceal his extramarital affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus, which was raised by Bill Clinton, when he lied during the second period in office of a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
There are many stories of cheating in school and university.
There are cases where teachers give their students test answers, only to make themselves look good in their opinions.
The mentors, who should learn to the contrary, sending out the message that lies and fraud is acceptable.
With many fraud we meet?
Studies show that in a single day lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let 's assume that many of them are full of lies.
Another study showed that people in the first 10 minutes of the first meeting in the life of lying about three times.
Determining the lies, or `` recognition of lies '', is the necessary skills, which should acquire each, whether for work or personal reasons.
It is, however, no social game, which would be similar to that of, say, a charade, when a man says: `` I have got you. ''- rated deception is a serious science, working with the scientific data collected during the last six decades of prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies have been refuted.
Liar you look into his eyes.
It 's not enough, said, red or were smirking.
Of course it is, that 's kind of hard to spot a liar and reveal.
A trained identifier lies can figure out the truth of the sentence structure, small expression on his face, the way the issues and their timing.
I spent a couple of years of scientific knowledge of large - scale and developing the sector on the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is modern skills, which can be easily learn and in today 's complex world, you can really help - especially if your job duties include hiring, the organisation of the interviews, or to the people.
Good liars can read well in the other, let 's let down his guard, steering their emotions and intuitively realize the other party.
The research, we know that the extrovert lie more often than introvert, that men uttering more `` self - centred ''lies, while women say more lies `` aimed at the other'' - mostly to protect someone 's feelings - that married people lie less often to its partners than single people (of course lies, which they say, tend to be `` outrageous '').
We also know that if you are seen as a sinner, others feel less guilty when you are lying.
How do you know that someone 's lying?
First, the normal behaviour of the body.
It 's called `` the initial observation ''.
Thanks to a subsequent findings with the match.
Note the body of his laughter, work with his voice.
You should know if someone is constantly tapping his feet to wrongly accused of lying in the middle of the meeting will begin tapping his feet.
Then try to determine if a verbal and non - verbal behavior.
Think of it, but only as a warning signals, rather than as evidence of lies.
People speaking a lie can stop moving his upper body, as he tries to remember his cover story, his film to the door, lean to the east, a marked change of attitude or show `` relief after the end of the conversation ''- exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position, when it 's difficult confession behind them.
The people conducting interviews often give a false signal, that 's an interview in the end, just to see how it will look like a relief after completion.
He is also the language of the body.
The story of how the Scott Peterson had a slip of the tongue and used the last time, when he said that his murdered woman 's life, which ran a national search for her body.
Deceivers individuals may also speak bluntly: `` I did not have a sexual relationship with the woman... Miss Lewinsky ''or the difficult question of all over again.

`` They should give us 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we have not yet gotten Peso ''.
The Court approved the `` end of analogue broadcasting ''in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals to digital is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court (SCJN) dismissed the action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against prezidenstkému Decree, which wants to speed up the so - called `` switching off analogue signals ''and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. said, needed eight votes, which would invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, thought that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed their authority when he issued a decree giving the individual steps, which will lead to a transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result was rejected by the Senate, and that, therefore, that has not been achieved by a qualified majority of the eight votes needed to court could comment on the constitutionality of or the constitutionality of the decree, which remains valid.
A draft of the judgment by the Secretary of State, Olga Sánchez Cordero is able to declare the decree as unconstitutional, because of all the issues relating to the radio and television 's case, which is under the law for the Federal Commission for telecommunications (Cofetel). there is a breach of the principles of the hierarchy of accountability and the law.
For the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument as the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported constitutional dispute in an effort to fight against the Decree. Secretary Sánchez Cordero has adopted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree, and all of the actions described in it, leading to a transition to digital.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the proposal, which is in charge of the Secretary of State also Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he does not agree with the arguments of the proposal, in the sense that the federal executive can not structure through general standards of measures to prepare the public administration.
`` I do not think that, even if it did, it would puncture the autonomy of the regulatory authority '', and said that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector, the federal government, which has the constitutional mandate to dictate the direction of the state.
The analogue signals to digital is one of the biggest changes, which has seen the world in the last years. associated with better use of the radio wave spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Believes that delay the change would be to delay the benefit of digitisation, which requires a decision in the case of public interest. digitisation, is not only a technical dimension, but `` it touches also economic, social, political and national security issues ''.
As he has said, these questions `` require the operation of the system in place, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State. covers a wide range of skills that the Constitution confers on into the hands of the Government of the State ''.
Reminded that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital system, and it did so by their governments, even though they have access to highly specialised technical authorities.
That is not possible for the government to issue a decree, which, to a certain extent, intervenes in the powers of Congress, led by the administration 's compliance with the law by legislative power.

November 9, the highest state court (SCJN) solved the constitutional dispute, initiated by the local legislative power and said the voice of the heads of state in the case of constitutional reforms as `` invalid and illegal ''because it does not have the right 's `` do not approve of, or veto''.
On the question of the census `` voice for his voice ''María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that, thanks to the approval of the General Council IEM, it will be possible for the partial or total counting local electoral authority.
In this way, the partial vote count, one or more of the electoral packages, can be carried out under the following conditions: the results of the election does not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation in the box, or it does not have the President of the available; or if there were errors and flagrant violation of the election results.
In addition, the total recount of votes in all polls will be possible, if there is evidence to suggest that the difference between a potential winner of the elections and a candidate for second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; always, when, at the beginning of the session there is an explicit request by the parties and / or the coalition, which has proposed a candidate for second place.

Appointed by the Prime Minister Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the italian president, to introduce the new government, which is facing a crisis, which has held this country on the brink of economic disaster.
Appointed by the Prime Minister Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the italian president, to introduce the new government, which is facing a crisis, which has held this country on the brink of economic disaster, and that the danger of the eurozone.
The presidential palace has issued a report in which he announced that the Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, is at the centre of the meeting with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that can form a government.
It is expected that the present Government composed mostly of technocrats, although so far is not yet clear when the new government takes power.
Monti said that he will present the results of their talks, which led to the political parties in an effort to form a government.
`` I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase, ''said the former European Commissioner journalists.
Monti explicitly said that it would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles are overcome.
`` The framework is now clearly marked '', he added.
Monti has completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, therefore, in a much shorter time than is usual. meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight against the political and financial crisis, because of the amount of debt soared to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by a former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package, which require european leaders. only it can restore wrecked the credibility of Italy.
The Monti is under pressure to hurry because of the volatility of the markets have exceeded the interest rates on italian bonds have a 10 - year 7 percentage threshold level, when Greece and Ireland had to apply for a rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, the President of the Italian the employers' organisation Confindustria, told reporters after a meeting with the Monti: `` we said that this government is very will support ''.
We believe that this government is a last resort to Italy from the burning of the situation.

`` We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti 's destined to good results, ''she told journalists Angelina Alfano, Secretary of the center - right parties.
Support for the PDL, most of the italian side, is significant because, until now, a number of its members opposed to the government with a majority, which produces the Monti.
Support for Parliament
The new Monti 's government must have the strong support of Parliament, in order to promote the unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstruction or delay in that effort could lead to new and a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of foreign banks are added to the pressure and warns that Monti 's failure could mean catastrophe.
Monti has launched a Monday meeting with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women.
Round of negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday President Napolitano, who made in response to the crisis very quick procedure.
After a brief decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi resigned, the interest of italian bonds returned to a critical level and respond to the uncertainty of whether the new Prime Minister will reap success.
To save Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be beyond the capabilities of current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti said that his government should stay in power until the next elections, which are scheduled for 2013, and despite the general forecasts, which says that politicians give him the only time to carry out reforms, and then makes the early elections.
Monti stated that he would like to his Cabinet, integrated policy, but the big parties insist that the government must be consists only of experts to lead Italy out of trouble, to which the country had been due to financial pressures.
Political sources indicated that the mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties to complicate the effort to integrate into the government and political figures.

The group is located on the south american continent in the framework of the tour in celebration of twenty years of existence, and on Sunday 20 will be a stop in Central America.
This day come from 19: 30 at the national stadium, together with the Group of the X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample of the conversation, which the full transcript can be found on the website of the La Nación on the Internet.
For your costa rican fans - it is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. do you realise what you are experiencing your fans?
The trip to Costa Rica is our dream, which is becoming a reality.
In South and Central America, we are barely a second time and experience have been great.
I went to Costa Rica only once, on vacation. this is a beautiful country, and I believe that we will be able to stay for a few days.
So we are delighted that you can bring our music.
I ask, because here on literally adore, fans in these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you think of his staunchest supporters?
Thank you, that 's when we were so long for a number of years.
It took us almost 21 years before we got to Costa Rica. thank you for so long and we are sorry that it took so long.
Some people on the concert is already as the biggest show of the year.
It raises you more pressure?
Some of the biggest show, which, we showed in the last 21 years, arose in the next few weeks.
Did some excellent show in Sao Paulo, and hope that we get into shape for the concert in Costa Rica.
In fact, at the concert looking forward.
We love this country, like serfujeme, we like the jungle. for both activities of Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
As you know me and the waves to surfing?
We have got a lot of friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. the waves are incredible.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or in Nicaragua, or Mexico. it is the best place to surf. and so we have to Costa Rica, by people who love of surfing.
If you look at your tour, you have a great show with many of the songs.
What are you planning on his presentation in Costa Rica?
In view of the fact that we had never played, we have no restrictions on what we could do.
We will try to do the best show with a variety of tracks. we will try to play a couple of songs from each of the album, and imagine our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You will never again repertoire.
Why?
I think that part of it is, therefore, that we have got nine albums and we can play more than 120 tracks and everyone loves the other songs, because it 's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we got in the repertoire of two of the three songs, which we did not play for a long time, we are focusing on them, and we are also a surprise, because we remember it, why are we so much and that we may have forgotten.
So it is for us to show more interesting, and I think that 's more interesting for people.
This tour are celebrating 20 years of art.
When you look back, it 's hard to believe everything that you have done?
Yes, that 's for sure.
First of all, I think that none of us could imagine that we will be in a great rock group, and that he is more than 20 years old, it sounds like a dream.
We are aware of how much is given to us and moved us, that we can continue to play together.
We love and like to create music.
We are lucky that we can look at the place, after which we always wanted.
We could not have gone better.
What does it mean to you, that you were an important part of the genre of grunge?
Each of us was honored to be part of this group, comprising representatives of all the big boys.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is surprising, if there is a movement of the group of friends, it does not happen very often.
From time to time in the city of the group, but it is much less common, from one of the city once had five to ten groups.
We are proud of that and we are honored to be part of a group of Seattle.
Sometimes, with some of the more we play.
Last year, we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. we are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement, which was founded in Seattle.
Also, it is very unusual for a group like yours to keep together and had even after all these years, still the same members.
Yes, we have 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer than the duration of the group.
I think that, first of all, we are all happy that we are still in this world, and the second, his role is played by the fact that he was interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and because of that, we have managed to open the musical journey, which they each enough freedom to experiment.
We believe in each other, we appreciate the music of the second, and I think that it could not be better.
Your relationship to the word fame was not simple. however, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find the balance?
As we grew, it was gradually getting easier to find a balance.
We try not to go too far on tour, because it 's very easy to fall into the trap of the crowds and the people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come because of the music, he reminded himself to the music, and what you have given her, respect must not get carried away, that you are famous, rock stars that neither of us really did not care.
How do you remember the next project Mother Love Bone?
I think that we are writing great songs and at the beginning it was glorious.
As the band 's three years and we have never made any album until after he died Andy (Andrew Woods).
It was very frustrating, because it took so long. the most important is that, even today, with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who were in a band with us. he was to hear a song or look at the pictures, I remember Andy, as was incredible, as I was with him the axeman. always, it was a joy to work with him, laughing, talking about music or on football and much more.
It was an incredible person and we are missing.
The band of the Las Robertas will be responsible for in Costa Rica opened the show.
Is it true that you know their work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that 's why you have to be chosen as the warm - up act?
Yes, we sent a video with some of the proposals, and this group we liked best. because we are curious what Las Robertas will offer a live, and they must be very amusing.
Why do not always live by changing the words of Yellow Ledbetter?
That 's the question to Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
He sings it, and I think that adds the first, what he thinks.
Who you like a bass player affects?
A lot of people.
My first challenge Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski.................
There are so many of them that I could all night to talk about the players who I like.
How he managed to Pearl Jam keep grunge, even though he is no longer in vogue?
I think that we are always all felt slightly from the words of grunge.
When you think of grunge, said the group, which I have mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that have arisen in the same time. and if today 's music, so it' s something great, because it is music to listen to and groups like Mudhoney today play better music than ever before.
At the beginning of your music slightly sinister character and now is more positive.
What is behind this change?
It 's interesting, because I have the feeling that, in the new album is a couple of songs, which are lighter, but also there are songs like the end or just Breathe, which are considered to be a very grim, even though they may be taken as a positive.
For both, when I 's Ed played, so I was crying, and they are songs deep in the dark.
I think that when you grow up and you are in the life of a trauma, you lose someone from the family or friend, these things will affect your art and music, and these two songs for me, this is what they represent.
I also think that you can not be a happy man, and I still do the music.

Park or the mountains?
The architects of the meeting on the occasion of a procedure, which carries more than the controversy about the fees
Urban competition for 16 gates again opened the debate about the role of the park Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid - 1980 s, at the height of the defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the government published a number of pamphlets in support of the park Collserola.
The leaflet defined the mountain as the Great Park metropolitan Barcelona.
What 's more, he was accompanied by a number of comparison with the New York Central Park.
Then, in 1987, CMB, Park is back on the minds of many as the borders of Barcelona Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on the north - south, but up (Montenegro) - down (the).
The qualification Collseroly as a natural park is a step in this direction.
Reference is no longer the Central Park, but the Yellowstone with feisty instead of Yogi Bear.
Such was the position until September, when the city announced a mega, consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of the gateways to Collseroly.
Gates, of course, is rather the idea of the park.
Either that, or someone is trying to put the gate to the field.
Here, the only question: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from the point of view of a purely organisational, not on the basis of a reflection of the city, the question becomes the central theme of all of the Barcelona architects.
It is already the subject as tired as when two members of this old caste elite at a meeting in the elevator.
And it was this act, one of the rare matches between what he thinks three of the architects and předstoupivší university professors.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayona: competition has merit.
According to Roldan, after she started a question of the Gulf, `` it should be discussed ''and `` on the side of the mountain,'' so the speech Ildefonse Cerda on green apples out.
`` We must be based on the principle that the Barcelona in the park 's beach.
Among other things, the availability of.
Collserola is more complex, `` said the architect, for which the name of ''the gate to the Collserola `` carry'' lexikologickou trap: `` we must not be `` as inputs into the park, but rather as a definition of zones, where it is possible to act ''.
Modol, as well as Roldan and Bayona has experience of the world of urban qualifies the proposal as `` an intellectual challenge ''offering `` a danger''.
The danger of `` uncertainty, which today is a project of the public space ''after the experience of the 1980 s, who had been in the area for `` the swan''.
The first concern is the demarcation of the border, where they should be.
`` Something to define the means to do is the next step, ''that is, in principle, to move a step further.
`` It should be borne in mind, the new urban planning and scheduling tool, because the current (with a reference to the Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster. ''
If we focus more detail on the question of Modol believes that the valleys Collserola can be considered a `` park '', but not part of the Barcelona, and that for reasons of pure topographical.
Modol also reminded that there is already a work carried out Patronat de Collserola, which `` may not end up in the garbage, ''even though it welcomes the fact that the city offers its context, that the project will hit from the `` first time''.
And, in addition, means that the proximity of the mountains and the city is a badge, which allows architects to participate in the debate, but `` doubts ''that it should be just this technical profile, which will create a multi - disciplinary teams (`` it 's all about the skills,'' says), which should be created: `` the architects should be only instruments ''.
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question, who gave the name of this game is a complex, because in the papers for the selection procedure is a global vision Collserola: `` it was handed down 16 competitions, which deal with all the axis of the mountains, the sea, but there is no longitudinal studies, which would be on the look and see it as a whole ''.
This has meant that he at least, volunteered for all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the project of one of the gates may hint at the concept and the definition of an architect of the gate.
In his view, the town hall was intended to guarantee that the band immediately above the Rondo de Dalt should ensure the whole length of the zone of equipment, to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.

'Health survey carried out between 1999 and 2006, have shown that in just six years, only for the boys to the rise in obesity by 77% and in girls of 47%. a dramatic increase in the case of overweight,' says expert from the IMSS.
That is one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the presumption that the population of the country is different from other stocks his genetic history.
Informed that the average Mexican has 65% indiánsko - America 's genetic makeup, 30% of the European and 5% of African. this is reflected in our genes, which are responsible for the development of diabetes and obesity.
He explained that, in general, genetics, obesity is normally explains as the inability to burn off excess energy they consume (calories), which are stored in the form of fat.
He explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that, given the overall assessment of the state of children, which will determine whether the show some overweight or obesity.
Said that even the presence of the dark colors (acantosis) on his neck and forearm suggests the likelihood that a person would suffer metabolic problems and předcukrovkovými conditions.
The information is confidential, doctors gave him in writing to parents and explain them all measurements and lifestyle changes, which must take to ensure that their children avoid disease.
Cruz López said that there are three main ingredients that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary behavior indicating a lack of daily physical activity, the day 's sitting in front of the tv and the use of means of transport instead of walking a short distance.
Overweight causes a caloric intake, the consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with high fat and protein and the genetic burden, which is the subject of this research.
In the tarmac of UNAM will not be potholes
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the chemistry UNAM creates a modified asphalts with polymers and creating a mixture of having to work better, regardless of the weather conditions and temperature.
If he is right on the pavement, it would not be necessary to repair the nearly 200 thousand potholes after each of the rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valle de México, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist from the chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, which, at the same time, he added, that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement was adequate, there would be a significant reduction of potholes, or even to be completely removed.
In his lecture technological cause potholes, which said in part of the International Year of Chemistry, said that under his leadership has modified asphalts with polymers, which should be a mixture of having a similar characteristics as the asphalt, but at the same time, more mechanical resistance, both at low, so at high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places with an extremely warm climate, for example, in some cities in the north of the country has improved. so the functionality and reduce the creation of potholes.
He explained that the hardest part of the oil, is a group of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with high molecular weight, which are called asfalteny, and the other with a low molecular weight, which are called malteny. jointly supplying the typical viscoelastic character.
Viscoelastic character of asphalt is that, at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, acts as a liquid, at 120 degrees has high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost as solid, while at low temperatures has the tendency to break, he added.
This means that the resilience of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but they are changing during the day, according to the weather conditions and temperatures, said an expert on chemical engineering.
A scientist from the chemistry was that most of the streets in Mexico City is covered with a flexible, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layer of the blacktop, made up of a small pebbles embedded in the asphalt and then compressed.
He pointed out that the stone, which is comprised of the cartridge, is covered with asphalt.
During the passage of cars or in the creation of the pressure is not possible, to force in the well.
If it were a modified bitumen, would be even better, the chemical engineer.
He added that the asphalt cartridge placed last layer called the cloak of soft rock, sand also covered in asphalt.
Given that this is coming into contact with the rims of vehicles must have greater mechanical power than the cartridge and must ensure the friction of the road.
Given that, as part of the pavement will be exposed to a large burden, must have a cloak of sufficient thickness and must be wary of the material from which it is made.
The climate, in particular the humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factor that should be borne in mind, in particular, the water has had a great impact on the viability of the cartridge.
Once, the ground is wet, the water is spreading in, and it 's hard to get out, it causes a softening of all layers of the street, and the emergence of potholes.
He explained that while creating potholes, as the first shot the film and, after the damage to the asphalt cartridge. damage but there at one point, but it is a slow process, which should be discontinued at the first sign of using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the national system of scientists also explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor in creating potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layers of pavement must meet the burden of vehicles and must ensure that this burden does not exceed. it is the only way we can prevent the emergence of potholes.
Rafael Herrera said that, as regards the asphalt, we still have a lot of work and research is at the beginning. is worth noting, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are in other countries already available on the market and make it easy to repair potholes without having to use a high temperature.
What was missing from the list of Valle for it to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramirez Serna obtained the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle so acquires 14. the title of the first vícemiss.
Valle del Cauca again reached on the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with that, that she was on the stage winner, won a silver crown and sash, on the basis of which became the first new vícemiss Colombia.
Based on the results of last night 's finale in Cartagena, in which she won, and took over the Miss Atlántico, the Department has won 14 of the title of the first vícemiss. Melina, joined the ranks of women from the Valle del Cauca, which came within reach of the winning, but in the end it was declared the first vícemiss. they include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Loren Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The question many asking what was missing?
The result is a defeat for the big favorite bands, which in all the previous rounds of the show, that is to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has become the queen of the police and the prettiest face Joile de Volgue. these titles have, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who then took the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors, which has ruled that the jury had decided her name only the first vícemiss, is the fact that his answer to the question: `` who do you prefer and why? '', by Murillo Martín Gómez of literary editors Leamos.
On the question of the candidate replied:
`` I read a lot of very, I believe in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms of zkulturňování. book, which I most affected in childhood, ''Little Prince'', a book.
At the present time I read `` crime and punishment ''. it 's a book, which is part of the global literature, which we all know and today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, russian author. this is a wonderful book called `` El ardor de La sangre''.
The answer is not like the term `` kulturalizovat, ''and, secondly, therefore, that the candidate, her individual mentioned in the book.
After the ceremony, she said, that is at peace and the joy of the outcome: `` the world is wise, what will be, will be.
And you people, read, if you can. Little Prince is a wonderful book. ''
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle was destroyed by the position of the champions.
Bogotský reporter suggested that the candidate was from the beginning of the most popular, the most celebrated and it took all the previous price (gastronomy call Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic clothes and the Queen Mother), created the envy of other candidates, stress the Queen, who then on the scene.
It was evident in the first presentation of the bathing suit on the beach Hilton and during the two shows before the final of the coronation.
Although both shone, hinted that she lacked the strength and passion that they showed the face of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a programme of `` home ''on Canal RCN believes that Melinda has won the title of the first vícemiss is confirmed by the fact that the candidate, who during the competition more titles left with a crown of the Queen''.
In addition, Valle in recent days, more hostile attitude to the media and it paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle had failed to convince the jury of their interest in social work, which are the basis of national beauty contests.
Only on the edge, two days before the election, the international jury member Lucy Doughty, stated that they are looking for a woman who is aware of the social needs of their country.
`` In a competition, Miss Colombia beauty alone is not enough, it was to be seen as something more than just a physical beauty is to focus on a social conscience. it is important that candidates before they enter into competition, have been involved in such projects, ''she said.
They also speculated that the ballot Valle lost points because of the shortcomings of his background and fibrosis, which was on the buttocks. but it 's completely at odds with the verdict of the jury, it chose Miss `` natural beauty ''for the healthiest body, diet and physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the Queen, acknowledges that she did not have the best body, that there is a good girl, `` but the problems with fibrosis at the bottom, which, in my opinion, was not too noticeable, her diminished points until the last day ''.
In the meantime, the reporter Guido Hoyos magazine Cromos believes that, a native of Valle made a mistake when he underwent several surgeries.
`` Surgical interventions are fine, but in the Valle,.
The body was never his strength and we had taken its toll ''.
Because of this award, which for the first time by the National Assembly of beauty, after the show in a bathing suit the cruel predictions, which was filled with. it was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina allowed her to grant the crown.
Whether that 's true or not, it is certain that Melina today launched a year of his reign, not as the Queen, but as a princess, from the position, which gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia on various international competitions, where it will be appointed by the national competitions.
However, to go down in history as one of the queens, which despite stirring success in Cartagena, the highest crest.
Such was the work of Cali, who identified the body of Alfonso Cana
An expert on the fingerprints of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of the `` Alfonso Cana ''.
The work of these officials is key.
4 November last year, an expert on the fingerprints of honour in Cali 's place in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader Farc: `` Alfonso Cana '', and that by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven experts on fingerprints, who work in the department of honor, was this week 's turn Eliazar González, the men of Puerto Tejada, who works in the field of research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where most of the more than five days through the forest, to get to a place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital city of Valle and after receiving the courses, he began to specialise in fingerprints. this science is on the study of the friction of the skin, so the palm of his hand and foot.
In the last week, which was carried out operations against the Alfonsi Canovi, Eliazarovi told to take the clothes to at least three days.
It was expected something big.
In a Friday night out in Cauca in a helicopter of the Palmira.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies and that the suspects that one of them is the man who led the oldest guerrillas in the world because it was asked to take the card with the fingerprints of Guillermo Le 6 N Seminario Sáenze (his real name).
However, when he was with the team in place, where she was dead, because of the physical appearance. looked very differently than in the media.
He did not have a beard, he was dressed as a villager in the field, without the glasses, a much slimmer.
But the fingerprints do not lie.
Together with galtonovou magnifying glass, ink and transplantátorem and light Eliazar began comparing daktylové records the records of the cards.
He was not failing: it was `` Alfonso Cano ''.
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was charged to the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, confirmed that he really was the commander of the Farc.
The search for feet
For daktyloskopa of Sijín de Cali 's recognition that Eliazarovi González showed President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference, operational services against `` Canovi ''very significant.
A lot of people do not know my work.
Fingerprinting is not an exact science, without the possibility of errors, which can play a key role in the decision - making of the crime.
In addition to the identification of the bodies will help these people for crimes such as theft and murder and confirmed the identity of the trapped people.
If they are caught, a lot of offenders presented false documents or do not have papers at all.
We take fingerprints and we are looking for is in the database.
The investigator said that in the event of an injury, he had in the house to remove a piece of the wall of the house, because this is where the thief leaning to pull out a vault full of jewellery and money.
The walls are difficult, because they are not intended for the collection of fingerprints, but in this case we would get the impression of a hand and identify the offender, who was involved in a number of robberies, ''he said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or deny a suspect in a murder case.
Not long ago, they found the dead man with bottles of alcohol around.
On the basis of the investigation found that the murder could be responsible, one of the family members and a fingerprint on a bottle of it actually said.
Although he could not confirm that he was a murderer, it is clear that appeared on the scene of the crime.
An expert on the fingerprints of honour explained that the objects of the `` sweeping through chemical or physical reactive ''.
If there are, for their collection used transplantátor or tape.
After the footprints are sent to Asif, a database of offenders, or on the cabinets.
`` The problem is that currently there are still many Colombians, whose data are not included, ''said an expert from the honour.
He explained that not everything is as it appears in a television programme CSI.
As well as all that glitters is not gold, not to touch, they remain tracks.
However, if it can be used to make the appropriate comparison.
`` Indignant ''protest in New York
Hundreds of manifestantů, crowding in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to set up camp.
A large part of it was waiting for an order clearing the area and walked to a nearby park.
The members of the Board of the Wall Street started on Tuesday, Representative of New York, when a court order to get back to Square in Manhattan, where they were shown in the morning. after tried to take another New York City Park.
Hundreds of manifestantů, crowding in Zuccotti Square, where he wanted to get through the order, which allows the `` indignant ''to go camping to bowl. the second part of the movement has responded to the clearing of having taken the park in the north of the city, where there has been a further detention.
`` If the court does not allow us to return to the square, located in another place and we will continue in the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through the Assembly, so peaceful demonstrations, ''said one of the speakers movement, `` Wall Street'', Mark Bray.
Bray said that the answer to the question `` outraged ''at the eviction of the camp, which he ordered the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, the Court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an injunction to stop the eviction of the place and allow manifestantům, to continue to set up camp.
In addition, `` indignation ''over other park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the site of the rectory at Trinity Church.
For an hour, they managed to take place, but then the police came and arrested some manifestanty. Bray, he did not know the exact number, but claimed that he saw that put the handcuffs and some journalists.
The organisation says that the site is a few hundred people came. delegation also religious leaders, to express support and also tried to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square, which is private property, remains closed. expects the court hearing, which is to take place just on Tuesday, and during which should be analysed the legality of the early - morning evacuations.
Some of the relocated manifestantů even carried and gave a copy of the court order, and even gave the members who were guarding the square, which raised `` some small clashes '', said Bray, who condemned the fact that some of the police manifestanty Bill.
A court order prohibiting the authorities to evict members of the movement `` Ocupa Wall Street ''or use the `` laws, which were published after he started to purchase, or prohibit manifestantům access to the park with shops or other places, which previously used''.
Mayor Bloomberg said to the press that, given that the city has suspended again open public space and manifestanty pointed out that local laws that allow them to return to their tents and sleeping bags.
High Representative of the city of personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square, the operation, in which was kept for 200 people and which have been accessed, because manifestanti `` break the law ''.
Bloomberg said that he ordered the evacuation of the square, because it `` the point at which people did not protest, but to violate the law, and in some cases to hurt others, ''because `` some shops received threatening letters'' and `` neighbors are worried about the quality of their life. ''
`` The evacuation was shocking, and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep the financial interests at the expense of american working people, ''said the spokesman, who accused the mayor, that `` do not respect freedom of expression''.
Representatives of the movement `` Ocupa Wall Street ''also indicated that they plan to organise a `` major action'' on Thursday, in cooperation with the community and the unions, to remind us of two months of the protests that started September 17.

Canadian Pamela Anderson was assistant Tim Allen in `` Home Improvement '', a lifeguard in `` Baywatch'', bunny in `` Playboy '', the wife of rokového musician Tommy Lee and now an actress and model will be of the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas on the canadian television.
Private television station CTV, today said that Anderson, together with the singer sentimental songs Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians appear in a television programme, `` it 's a Russell Peters Christmas ''on 1 December and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage of a television programme, in which Anderson, also known by the domestic pornographic pictures, will appear with her former husband, the engine of the `` Mötley Crüe ', Tommy Lee, like a Virgin Mary holding in the creche doll representing Santa Claus.
As Josef appeared Peters, a well - known canadian comedian of indian origin, who recently served as moderator of the tour, `` we Violent Torpedo of Truth ''Charlie Sheen.
In addition to the Anderson and Peters, in a special Christmas broadcaster CTV, a canadian singer Bublé, who was at the end of March, married in Buenos Aires, Argentina 's model Luisanou Lopilato, and who is close to the controversy.

Japan after the devastating earthquake comes back to life
GDP is growing by 1.5%, thanks to the household consumption and ending the falls, which began in March
Since March of last year was the japanese economy was paralyzed, now is recovering from a devastating earthquake, which had resulted in a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster, which has had to face since World War II.
The first estimates tokyjské Government material losses to 300 000 million dollars, a wound which, despite the difficult global situation healing well.
After three quarters of the value of GDP between July and September in a position that it can definitely turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and a 6% a year.
The results of the second quarter - for the japanese fiscal year starts in March 2012 - to the largest growth rates in comparison with the period January - March 2010.
Recovery can be explained in part by the purchase of the machines, which are necessary for the reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, decline of 0.9% compared with the January - March. this is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, a real awakening of Japan 's economy is based exclusively on impulse, which makes use of the crisis, for the strengthening of, or to restore infrastructures. is to take advantage of the lack of to completely from scratch.
Japan had awakened. thanks in particular to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan 's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, due to an increase in expenditure on the vehicle, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
Flows have been in the hands of the internal market, when the Yen - japanese currency - has become one of the `` rescue ''values for investors, who are running away from the debt crisis in the euro area and in front of the alarming forecasts of the U. S. it is a privilege, but it is also a big burden for export businesses.
A stronger currency are products abroad more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony to weak results in July when in September was the exchange rate of the yen.
While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the government Yoshihiko Noda is prudent.
`` We have to give attention to the risks that remain, as is the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase in the yen, ''said yesterday that the Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed it is not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most of the Member States in September showed clear signs of an economic slowdown.
Indicator, which predicts the inflexibility in the world economy, showed that the economy of the major powers is slowing down.
Decreased by four - tenths of EUR 100,4 points from 100,8 in August.
The eurozone is even below the average, which is located on the level of 100. got down to the level of 99,13 points.
Athens again spreads uncertainty
Papademos says that will be approved austerity measures, but the Conservatives will not sign a written commitment
With the rapid and risk fringe guarantees and uncertainty, which again was, Greece is still more exposed to the labyrinth, which leads to the exit from the debt crisis in Europe.
The presumption that the `` consensus ''of the new transitional greek government is given to the requirements of Brussels than genuine conviction of political forces, is starting to confirm.
While the new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, yesterday admitted that for structural reforms, there is no alternative and that the period of 100 days, his appointment will probably be short for their application, chairman of the conservative party, New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said that the new austerity measures in any case to support and repeated his request for new elections to the expected date of February 19.
`` The main task of this government 's decision to apply the summit of 26 October, ''Papademos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate, which will culminate in tomorrow' s vote of confidence.
The package with 24 programmes have to promote employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and the new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, a message Samarase did not clarify doubts about his position: `` we have pledged to support the transitional government, but nothing else we are committed. ''
The Conservatives went further in his speech to the address of the EU and the IMF a bit far. these organisations to 8 billion, which Athens urgently need. but at the same time, he said, that support and to sign a commitment regarding the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission has already enraged at the impact that caused the Papandreou games with the referendum, yesterday stressed that their requirements are the ultimate: released no help, if the new government and the leaders of the main parties have written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible. ''
Spokesman for economic affairs, Ahmad Altafaj, explained that the inspectors from the troika returned to the `` very soon ''to Athens and will act with the new government about it, `` what he needs to pay for the sixth'' 8 billion. the final date but does not exist.
The greek Spinner has such a moment of interference.
The Queen Sofia: `` there are instruments for progress and hope ''
The Queen of the privileged position of Spain in relation to this type of Finance
`` Spain has made significant position at the global level, as regards mikrofinance ''.
The Queen Sofia yesterday said that the country is in the last two decades, has become the second donor of the planet, as regards this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is that, `` that this is a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. it 's an instrument based on trust in a man ''.
The Queen yesterday launched a 5. the global summit micro - loans in Valladolid, in the belief that `` there is no doubt ''that this kind of operation is `` absolutely necessary'' for it to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations to 2015. `` in terms of the objectives, which are to reduce by half the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, with the amount, which sets the poverty threshold ''.
Spain `` will continue to work, ''and the network of volunteers, `` in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsibly'', stressed the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiative and the benefit of the summit, which will last until Thursday, `` will create better capacity and opportunities for the poorest and, in particular, for women, ''which are these loans primarily intended.
`` We have achieved many ''and `` many challenges are still ahead of us.''
The summit of mikropůjčkách is not only a discussion forum, but also a platform, which will support the `` core objectives ''.
Her Majesty, explained that the aim is that by the end of the year 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and to 100 million families above the poverty threshold below which currently live.
The concept of micro - loans in Spain and in other countries of the world, then, `` what is this journey has pioneered the idea of Muhammad Yunus, ''said the Queen, and added that it is `` an act of justice and the necessary recognition''.
The father of this instrument, described as `` an idealist, who led the way in the fight against poverty. ''with his work is about 15 years ago, when she went into Bangladéže, to put in place with its lending policy.
After this experience was followed by others. the first global summit in Washington and other meetings as, for example, in Côte d 'Ivoire in 1999, in Canada in 2006. `` in all of these meetings I could find the constant evolution, said the Queen, who, thanks to his support of this project earned the last title' head of the family `` in Valladolid bestowed ''movement of the poor''.
The Queen Sofia concluded his speech, calling on the parties to engage in discussions and the search for solutions and to continue the fight against poverty.
`` An ethical imperative. ''
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said, `` it is an ethical imperative that solidarity '', which must be followed by all the democratic states.
In this sense, she said, that would be a mistake in cooperation with the developing countries, with only the balohobytu, because this is a `` permanent obligation ''.
Jimenez believes that micro - loans represent a `` serious and honest policy, which is to eliminate poverty '', and now more than ever, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and to just solidarity becomes the victim of budget cuts.
For Spain 's mikropůjčka, one of the main lines of development cooperation.
Minister of State for International Cooperation Soraya Rodriguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept is based on the trust of the people, all the rest of the locked door. mayor Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the participants in the city, which `` opens its gates to the spirit of solidarity, which is contagious. ''
The CDU proposes to elect the President on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious trouble for the Chancellor and the chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party, Angela Merkel took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The question of the future of Europe on the programme was not originally, but became her up in the autumn, in particular to party members, who are the policies of the government today to the Greeks and maybe tomorrow against the Italians for lax.
The proposal for the president of the European Commission 's management was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the number of 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstentions.
A standing ovation at the end of Angela Merkel, and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, very pro - european finance minister, leaving room for doubt.
The Chancellor and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: `` the answer to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe ''.
Not only that, Europe is peace, but that the `` nine million jobs depend directly on the euro. ''
According to the Chancellor in Europe, `` it is time for change. ''
This could make changes in the Lisbon Treaty, designed to strengthen the control of the European Union over budgetary policies of the Member of the countries of the euro area, but also that could result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage, `` in order to give Europe a face ''.
That is, in any case, one of the thoughts of the proposal adopted by Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is surely only a little likelihood that all twenty - seven countries in this revolutionary step quickly agree: against the United Kingdom and the leaders of the CDU, thinks that the same stance also Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the direction is set.
As delegates rejected most of the proposal to the weight of each country on the board of directors of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which obviously will result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany.
Led by worries calm climate within his own party, the Chancellor has made several references to the Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. and try to get Congress to talk of the `` small ''european states or on the states that are in difficulty, willing to criticize the arrogance of Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe gives one paragraph of the importance of `` the franco - german friendship '', Angela Merkel, quoted by France.
Only indirectly.
When reminded that just over two hundred years ago in Leipzig bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats against Napoleonic army.
What constitutes fraud at work?
After dropping aid party UMP and the government offensive against the work.
Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday, 15 December in Bordeaux, visit the Office for the provision of social support, where she delivered a speech on the subject of repeated from 2007 on the fight against fraud and redistribution of social solidarity.
To the accompaniment of the offensive, which is based on the will to implement savings in the context of the increased severity, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right - wing of the presidential campaign, the right - wing majority wants to concentrate on the job.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose on the staff of the private sector on the fourth day of work before they start taking aid in disease.
Clearly, without the consent of the company 's employee, who had lost four days' wages, then at least 15% of their monthly income.
The measures, which runs the risk of causing a lot of damage, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos, could bring about 280 million euros.
And also the measures, which would be accompanied by other measures of a symbolic range: to give public employees one day of unpaid work (and still do not have any inability over three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of the debate, the right - wing majority also triggers the diversity of fraud aimed at abuses tied to the work.
`` The checks will be much larger and more: if you are caught, you will come back, ''said Xavier Bertrand in the interview given by the station RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate to the truth of wrongdoing at work.
These are the subject of ongoing monitoring since 2002 and political onslaught, which brought its fruit.
The French are more powerful than elsewhere in Europe.
Let 's stop first in several of the official numbers.
According to the maladie (CNAM - state health insurance) in 2006 paid more than 237 million euro daily allowance.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in healthcare, in 2008, the daily with their 11.3 billion euro 5% in health - care spending.
Of this amount, 46% of the concerned parent contributions and industrial accidents and 54% of the work, i. e. 6.2 billion euros.
Therefore, only 2.5% of health - care costs.
According to a study by a group of Alma Consulting had the French in 2010, an average of 14.5 days work versus 17.8 days in 2009.
Average, which carries a certain derogations: another poll published in 2007 in the pages of dealing with the Monster. Com showed that 75% of respondents 40,000 french workers said they had no day of work.
Another study, this time by the institutions of sickness insurance, argues that, in the 2010 37.8% of jobs are less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% took longer.
When compared with their european neighbours, french workers are more than elsewhere, prone to work.
A study carried out in 2010, two researchers CNRS (the National Research Center), showed that between 1994 and 2001, the total absence of (for reasons of health or not) oscillate in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK, and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating at work represents only a very small part of the compared to work on the black.
As regards the fraud, these are just a small - scale.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002, that there is a systematic controls on the work of more than 45 days.
In 2008 the CNAM noted that, with 1.5 million checks was 13.8% of 285,000 carried out for short - term defaults, `` irregular or too long '', i. e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled for more than 45 days, there were 11% of cases of `` non - adapted or irregular ''to 1.2 million checks, i. e. 132 000.
A total of 169, 000 `` irregular ''cases of several million workers, who had the inability to work.
The number, which is far less than the number of jobs in the black.
According to the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, the author of the report on this issue, this number would be a 9 to 15 billion euros of missing in tax revenue for the year, i. e., more than the total amount of daily allowances and therefore infinitely more than fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply the new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to replenish its economy.
On Monday, December 14, he said this before Parliament, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, and added that a hundred days of his government of unity to this task.
`` In order to regain our economy, we need the support of our european partners and new financial rescue plan, ''said the head of the government, when he spoke at the center of his first public speech at the start of the debate to a confidence vote in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken by the 27 October at the Summit of the euro area will be `` the main task ''of the new government, as in the game 's participation of our country in the euro area, he added.
As a result, Mr. Papademos assumed that the public deficit countries will be from now until the end of the year `` in the vicinity of the 9% of gross domestic product after what was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right 's rejects new austerity measures
Leader of the right - wing Antonis Samaras said on Monday its support has already approved the measure in order to try to escape from the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party will not commit to any additional austerity.
`` For any new measures do not raise his hand, ''said Samaras, in a meeting with members of his party 's new democracy.
We have agreed on the objectives relating to the reduction of the deficit and debt, and the fight against wasteful, but we are against any policy, which would hinder economic recovery.
Mr. Ollimu Rehn, the European Commissioner for the economy and currency, which warned that the IMF and the EU to unblock the necessary loan 8 billion euro without written guarantees of all parties, which support the measures, Antonis Samaras said that his word is enough, and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It should be legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the Commission of experts
According to the report, the canadian company 's Canadians who denied the death.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires that governments, institutions responsible for the health and doctors were working together to ensure the best palliative care, and even in the cases of cancer.
The canadian company 's idea of the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accepts the opportunity to talk with your doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and take decisions in this sense.
It 's one of the findings of the widespread reports of the Royal Canadian Company, which included six experts working in different areas, one of which was the ethics law and medicine.
The Commission recommended the government to change the law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, so if this option as necessary for the patient, considered to be competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning of the experts cite a recent independent poll by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada placed on the 10 th place, the study notes that the `` medicalisation of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death. ''
Medikalizace yes or no, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, telling us experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian society.
And despite the wish to die at home, which has the most Canadians, 68.6% of them dying in the hospital.
This applies to all of Canada, while in the province of Quebec, the figure is the highest with 86% of those who have died in the hospital.
As regards the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report concludes that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide will not change anything.
According to the experts, who are also subject to all of the countries where they are legalised or are not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalise causes some kind of abuse in the application, i. e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on the person or mismatched.
Conversely, P. Jocelyn Downie, a co - author of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference more than numerous cases of these missteps in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide is not illegal.
`` Euthanasia is carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal. ''
`` Assisted suicide is carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, ''says Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians are in favour of euthanasia
We all remember that, according to a survey conducted by Angus Reid Forum in 2010 with 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia, because he believes that will allow people to the end of his life to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalisation of euthanasia will mean that we are sending the message that the life of old or disabled people is worth less.
As regards the persons who are assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that people should not be prosecuted.
In the case of the maintenance of or interruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also on the list of its recommendations to claim that it was in the criminal law states that withdrawal of treatment, for which there is a legally confirmed rejection, is not a crime.
The experts also requires that the doctors were trained to obligations to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of life without fear of prosecution.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires that governments, institutions responsible for the health and doctors were working together to ensure the best palliative care, and even in the cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or definitive cessation of already widely used in the canadian health facilities, the Commission is required to be considered at a time when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain, for euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedure.
The other experts
Some experts on medical law has already expressed its reservations on the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Canadian society.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist on the medical law, characterised the position of experts - the signatories of the reports as `` extreme '', among other things, therefore, that does not restrict the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final stage.
`` This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life, which should more than 18 years, could apply to help him commit suicide, ''says Pierre Deschamps, who had studied résumé reports.
P. Deschamps also stressed that it looks as if the authors of the report were building the autonomy of the above all other values, which make up the social fabric of society.
As `` in the company, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions ''.
A specialist medical law Margaret Somerville also expressed `` strong objections to the conclusions of the report which described as ''a manifesto for euthanasia''.
Margaret Somerville, which itself is a member of the Royal Canadian society, especially doubts about data reports concerning the absence of any misconduct in some countries, where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i. e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon.
The jordanian king calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus talks of a `` conspiracy ''
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al - Assad yesterday demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday he stepped up diplomatic pressure on Syria 's President Bashar al - Assad, who, with the support of Russia resists and talks about the `` conspiracy ''against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria 's membership in the League of Arab States increased the European Union sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, a country bordering with Syria, take a stand in favour of the departure of President Al - Assad.
Jordan 's King Abdullah II was yesterday, the first ruler of the arab state, which called on President Bashar al - Assad in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the military forces of the regime have been killed, `` to give up power. ''
`` If he was at the heart of the interests of his country, he would have to submit his resignation, but it would also create the conditions for a new phase in the syrian political life, ''said the King of Jordan, a country bordering with Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For its part, the head of the turkish diplomacy Ahmet Davutoglu said that efforts to turkish mediation with the syrian regime undertaken since the beginning of the year was not successful.
`` Those who in the Middle East do not live in peace with their people and can not meeting them, ''he said, referring to the neighboring Syria, to which Turkey applies increasingly tougher line.
The United States said of `` strengthening consensus against Al - Assad and the syrian regime ''after the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
`` The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey applied increasingly tougher tone ''against the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As announced by the syrian Observatory for Human Rights, during this period were killed in the city of Deraa in the south of Syria 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime 's forces.
According to the non - governmental organisations have killed two other civilians `` in firefights and focused shooting from heavy machine guns in the town of Jobar ''in the field of homs.
However, at a press conference, the syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country was `` on the way out of the crisis. ''
Indeed, quickly responded to the decision by the Arab League to suspend Damascus membership, which represents a `` dangerous step ''.
Syria `` dips '', he added, with the assurance that `` spinning conspiracy against Syria will not succeed.''
After its decision to suspend Syria 's membership of the choice is in the process of the Arab League `` mechanism for the protection of civilians ''and plans to send up to 500 of the country of human rights activists, journalists and military observers.
The french foreign minister, Alain Juppé is also in favour of the idea of sending the UN observers, in order to help to protect civilians from repression scheme, which according to him was `` paranoid ''.
A special meeting of the League 's call for tomorrow in Rabat, to take a position on the plan to resolve the crisis, decided on 2 December and was involved in the withdrawal of forces from the cities plagued by discord and release imprisoned manifestantů.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was yesterday 's decision of the League of Arab States as `` flawed '', while China has urged Syria to plan to resolve the crisis, but it is completely avoid support any sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requires time and the victim after the Italians
The next head of the italian government of Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time, in order to form his own team and begin to implement the program, which will include a `` victim ''in order to regain the credibility of the lost in the last months of Berlusconi 's government.
The former European Commissioner, yesterday he discussed with the political parties before today to meet representatives of trade unionists and employers.
He should draw up a relatively lean cabinet of technocrats belonging to the parliamentary parties.
`` Monti talked about an important programme, with many of the victims, ''said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the nominee for prime minister.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini, expects the Mario Monti to Friday asking Parliament in a vote of confidence, to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end Mario Monti, a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti yesterday said the nervousness in financial markets and asked them on time.
In `` democracy is the exact dates ''as regards the preparation of the government and its program, has pointed out, and he added that he is `` confident that the markets will be patient and understanding''.
His appointment as President was welcomed by the markets from the beginning, but the concern is again after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area.
Appointed by the Prime Minister should draw up a team including, in particular, the technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to take the `` policy ''.
Expressed the belief that the new government would last until 2013, i. e. the date of the next election.
According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini 's new government will have the confidence of Parliament on Friday.
Mario Monti, after taking office, he promised that he would act with extreme urgency and with a view to Italy `` once again become a strong Europe. ''
The Speaker of the European Commissioner Olli Rehn pointed out that `` even with the new government is our diagnosis of the italian economy does not change. ''
The European Union is convinced that Rome despite austerity plan adopted in recent months to achieve its objectives, which is a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
The head of the business association Confindustria Emma Marcegagliová, who is with the Monti meets on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy `` for the country, which does not show growth, can not comply with the deficit parameters ''.
Mario Monti, the former European Commissioner (1994 - 2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, `` Professor ''symbolizing according to the authors of the editorial `` call for seriousness'' and `` another Italy '', is for Italy `` epochal change'' after 17 years of `` berlusconismu ''.
The big unknown is the life of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has until April 2012 to place the government bonds for 200 billion euros.
Soviet scientist who helped the iranian nuclear program
The soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator usable for nuclear weapons, announced on Tuesday, a U. S. non - governmental organization dedicated to the atomic risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is in the identification of the scientists, based on the report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents released by the UN agency.
Last week, the IAEA said its `` serious concern ''in terms of `` possible military dimension'' of the iranian nuclear programme.
According to the Institute of Isis widely pumping from the documents to the IAEA, V. Danilenko (b. 1934) should work for three decades, since the 1960 s in the soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk Ural (), where he was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds method of the explosion.
In 1989 and 1991 had to leave the centre in Kiev founded the company producing the `` nano - diamonds ''.
The economic problems of his company would bring him to contact in 1995 by the iranian embassy in Ukraine.
Before his return to Russia to cooperate from 1996 to 2002 in Iran 's programme.
In its latest report, the IAEA is reminiscent of the `` clear indications that the development of a detonation system by Iran ''came `` from the work of foreign specialists, who not only knew this method, but that - how about that one Member State agency informed - worked during a substantial part of his career to this technology in the military nuclear programme of the country, where it comes from.''
Anti - muslim crimes and offences increased by 50%
According to statistics published by the FBI on Monday, the number of crimes and offences against Muslims has increased from 2009 to 2010 by almost 50%, while at the same time the other racial and religious violence fell slightly or much increased.
According to those figures, the total number of atrocities committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i. e. a 49% increase compared to the procedure on 13% for violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% for offences against the Jews and the overall increase of 14% in protináboženských crimes and offences.
The total number of `` hate crime ''very slightly up on 6,628 cases, of which 47.3%, according to the FBI motivated by racial differences and 20% of religious differences.
`` After a loss in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences rise again '', highlighted by Human Rights First human rights, `` the growth of anti - muslim violence is especially significant'', said the organisation in its communiqué.
`` Human Rights First long emphasized that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious infringement of the rights of man, ''says one of the leading actors of the Organisation of Paul Legendre.
`` The american government can and must do more to deal with these abuses '', he adds, and estimates that this could be achieved by improving the police reports on the `` hate crime''.
`` Hate crime ''in the U. S. federal law is the legacy of the struggle for civil rights.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King, to punish the violence associated with the race, skin colour, religion, ancestry and now and sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and resembles more Facebook
Page providing mikroblogovací Twitter introduced on Monday, changes in the design, to allow its users to watch the activity of the successor, somewhat mimicked her services to Facebook.
The new `` activity ''and `` name'' allow better and directly familiar with the work of other people that you are watching or persons, whose response (`` tweets '') are watching you.
It allows you to know whether to monitor the contributions, whether log on to new accounts, whether they are the favorites, etc.
The new face of Twitter was tested `` in August on a small percentage of users ''before it was on Monday extended to the entire network, said the agency AFP spokesman Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for his little instinctive operation, with the terms of a somewhat obscure (RT for repeated the spread of the contribution of someone else, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s' ouvre ainsi and un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable and celui des réseaux grand public Facebook and Google +.
The network users immediately in their `` tweets ''differently on the importance of this innovation.
`` It is unnecessary, it takes a lot of space and too much like Facebook, ''wrote @ jemb 123.
`` The work of me better help monitor some of the elements of my Twitter '', sent @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entering a golden rule of a balanced budget in the Constitution
The government of the grand coalition of the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday, entering a `` golden rule ''of budgetary policy into the Constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid a possible reduction in the evaluation of Austria 's credit rating agencies (AAA).
It was the social - democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced the decision at the conclusion of the meeting of ministers in a situation where the austrian public debt is with his 74.6% above the criterion of up to 60% set by the Maastricht agreement, but far less than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
`` If the solvency of Austria reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA +, we 'd have to pay interest each year on three billion euros more '', he argued the vice chancellor and foreign minister, křěsťanský Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria as a follow - up to the summit of euro - area countries meeting in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where heads of state and government strongly requested that, by the end of 2012, the reduction in public deficit and to balance the public accounts written into the constitution or the law of the same value.
Instrument adopted by the austrian government is close to the `` german model '', Germany was the first european country to such a `` rule'' has adopted.
By the year 2017 will have to public structural deficit fall each year by 34% of gross domestic product (GDP) and starting in 2017, the structural deficit of the federal state, each year exceed 0.35% of GDP, while the federal states, as well as the community, they are going to have to have a balanced budget.
The aim is to get in 2020 / 21 public debt below 60% of the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Only a strong
Noda threatens new interventions in the foreign exchange markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yošihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that japanese institutions to intervene in the foreign exchange markets, if he had just continue to strengthen.
`` We target, as we did last time, if we find excessive volatility ''in the exchange rate of the yen, explained the Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, only to rise to historic levels, 31 October, forced the japanese authorities for intervention.
That day, sold Tokyo yen for dollars, to reduce the value of the japanese currency, which only recently surpassed the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only regularly since then, supported by purchases of investors, who regarded him as a `` safe haven ''in the global economic slowdown and the crisis caused by the debt.
The dollar on Tuesday again came under 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic bar 105 yen to close to levels that triggered last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008 - 2009 was the dollar value of around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This outbreak of the japanese currency is harmful to the island 'exports more expensive, because the price of products made in Japan and reduces the value of the proceeds received by the japanese firms from abroad, when it is transferred to the domestic currency.
`` Japan is recovering ''from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated Tohoku region in the north - east of the country, has pointed out, the Y. Noda, who fears that this rise in the price of the yen was still in the eggs of the fragile recovery.
A third economic power in the world - in the third quarter of growth (1.5% in the previous quarter) and for the first time in a year, thanks to the exploration of export growth and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister said that the high value of the yen reflect `` the economies of Japan ''.
Japan 's Finance Minister Jun Azumi urged the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which launched on Tuesday a two - day meeting of its monetary policy, and the Council to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But víceguvernér this institution Hirohide Yamaguči pointed out that the fight has previously taken `` appropriate measures ''to suggest that any additional monetary weakness can not be at the centre of the expected.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for issuing securities increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) of its purchases of Treasuries and increased to 55 billion yen (519 billion euros) to the ceiling of the amounts in the various securities with a view to the flood of liquidity.
The eurozone:
The rates are rising, stock markets are failing
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermines the indicators.
Over the appointment of a new heads of government in Greece and Italy, and a number of growth in France and Germany, the rates of weak countries continue in its growth.
European stock markets are still concerned about the stability of the euro area is now on Tuesday, November 15, settling into negative expectations.
In Paris in 10 hours index CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The DAX in Frankfurt lost 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
`` With the new tensions around the proceeds of the loans, which are in trouble, continue to equity markets around the world are only part of the recent gains ''.
`` Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of the disease, ''said Terry Pratt, a broker IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The stock market in Tokyo closed with a fall of 0.7%, which has suffered because of fear of market participants about Europe 's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
`` Japan, as well as the rest of the world has his eyes on Europe and the shift will continue only in a narrow range of variation, while investors will not be evidence that the situation is stable '', estimated Mitsušige Akino, a fund manager at Ichiyoši Investment Management.
This re - starting the uncertainties about the future of the euro area is detrimental to the currency, which on Tuesday continues its decline.
The euro is at the lowest level since the last month and a half.
In the 10 o 'clock is the european currency, the value of the dollar in the retreat of 1,3570 0.4%.
According to the broker currency fell back after Chancellor Angela Merkel 's CDU party at its Congress adopted in Monday' s proposal, anticipating the possibility of out of the euro for the country, find themselves in difficulty, without having to leave the European Union.
The italian and spanish rates far beyond the borders of the 6%
Interest rates for loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very disturbing.
This morning on Tuesday, italian 10 - year bonds is 6,85% and the return of the spanish 10 - year bonds is 6.2%.
This tension on the interest rate of the southern european countries, but also in France, continues to reinforce fears of market participants.
The future of the italian government of Mario Monti strongly called for in the markets time to correct the situation in Italy at risk of illness caused by the value of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the application of the decision taken by the 27 October at the Summit of the euro area will be the `` primary task ''of his government.
Spain, once again, is in the line of the markets, as the country held in Sunday 's elections to the House of Representatives.
The difference (`` spread '') between 10 - year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a historic high.
In anticipation of the eurozone growth
The statistics say that France has recorded in the third quarter of economic growth of 0.4%, primarily due to the consumption of households, i. e. a little better than expected growth of 0.3%.
France 's National Institute of Statistics and economic studies, however, INSEE revised downward the number for the second quarter to a decrease of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And the truth is that the fourth quarter, economists are worried about the most.
Of his party during the same period Germany registered growth of 0.5%.
The first estimates for the eurozone are expected in 11 hours, while the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must win over dogmas
If there is a theme that can not grasp on the basis of short - term balance sheets or under the emotion, then it 's energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity, have a direct effect on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural that the meeting of the election was an opportunity to think about such deposits and on the site, which occupies the energy from the core.
The debate will be successful only when they will explore all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must establish its position on the objective facts and figures.
So far, the world of 7 billion human beings, but demographic developments will from now on, by 2050, a doubling of the demand for electricity, to a significant portion of the world 's population of the important part of life.
At the same time, it will be necessary to deal with the lack of fossil resources in order to be able to continue to generate electricity, and may not be necessary to forget about the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions to fight against climate change, which is a subject that is in the process of disappearing from the environmental debate.
The accident at Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters.
And that 's why Germany is itself in its decision to refuse to nuclear energy.
But that is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decisions need to find some other source capable of replacing itself, or Switzerland, which is considered to be the right to build only the last generation.
Conversely, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some of the countries, will continue with determination in their projects.
The United States, after the Fukushima decided to expand its fleet of one unit of the restoration of power plant construction of one of the Chernobyl power plant at Three Mile Island.
If the german model based on renewable energies ever presented as an example of the reality of the conflict.
The choice of Berlin, the effect of higher electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas imported from Russia in particular, a sharp increase in CO 2 emissions caused by the construction of power plants to natural gas and coal.
All of these unpleasant effects to be felt within several months.
The case of Denmark deserves to consider.
European champion in the wind, which takes 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest consumer of coal and gas because of the wind, which are the CO 2 emissions and the danish electricity prices higher by 65%, or 50%, than the european average.
Conversely, thanks to the stability of our energy policy will pay our neighbors invoice for electricity by 40% higher than the payment of french households.
While in a globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in the competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining the industry on the national territory, the french companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would be generated strong increases in electricity prices, which would make it the illusion of a declaration on the industrialisation of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
The price that a large majority of the french refuses to pay, as well as fundamentally opposed to this energy, as polls show.
We all remember that energy policy of our country to stand up to the industry to 125,000 jobs directly and with 410,000 downstream jobs.
Strong export sector dragged on international markets, a large number of small and medium - sized companies specialised that generate jobs, which can not be transferred to another country.
If France has decided to leave the core, to a large number of these small and medium - sized enterprises and came about 6 billion euros per year, of which country it acquires the export of nuclear equipment and services.
The owner of the power plant, a nuclear reactor designed to work 60 years, while it was planned Bankruptcy his producer?
In the resolution of the energy equation is to admit that there is no magic source of energy production, and that there is no evil.
The development of the installations of low CO 2 emissions, nuclear facilities and equipment using renewable energy sources by the french industrial group Areva is indicative of complementarity sources of energy.
In the case of nuclear energy is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carried out a rigorous and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants, as well as the construction of new power plants.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, to the idea of safety in the blood.
For fifty years recognized the nuclear industry three of a serious accident.
One in Three Mile Island occurred in conditions of normal operation and remained without human victims, and the consequences for the environment.
In Chernobyl drama caused the concept of the reactor and inexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take the lessons learned from this accident, just as it did in the previous two.
The fruit of this step and co - operation between french and german authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and developers is that the reactor type EPR is a concept capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While all of the candidates who wish to build a nuclear power plant, it is considered, stop its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered by competitors group Areva and EDF and the release of the way to take the lead in the nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate search for the best solutions to the energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations to dominate the debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
It is for the economy, immigration or chance?
The policy in the field of immigration, Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from different angles - the backlog of the police, the courts and the administration 's policy of having been levels, the compatibility of this policy is `` human rights ''to France.
Recently it was the administrative harassment, which is the foreign students, which had become the current, the Interior Minister (see list Libération from May 23) said that France `` does not need foreign talent, bricklayers and waitresses ''.
But so far the only rarely discussed at an angle of the economy.
I must say that in this area is a very broad consensus between left and right.
On the right tone in 1976 gave Jacques Chirac your statement that `` thousand unemployed should not be a problem in the country, where there are 2 million migrant workers, ''and on the left, Michel Rocard, as in the 1990 s, said that France `` can not take all the poverty of the world''.
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, he was the fear of invasion of hordes of polish plumbers to the french territory of shared the left and right.
In both camps are immigrants seen as a burden on the economy and the french company.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity, which is to provide immigrants.
In its programme is François Hollande, limits on banalities, indicates that the joint development will solve our `` migration problem ''.
This idea of immigration as a burden, and the problem is perhaps in elections, economically, but it is very expensive.
As I recall, the economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published book syntetizujícím latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: how Migration shaped our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press; 352 pp.): between specialists, there is broad consensus on the positive impact of migratory movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that immigrants adopted.
Reducing immigration is crippling the growth and employment.
Concerns about the impact of the migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace french workers, especially those less qualified, and create a downward pressure on the wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, are immigrants, much more than by supplementing the replacements for the french staff that they carry out the work in sectors with a shortage of staff.
Few skilled immigrants in sectors that the story of the french staff, and the most qualified in the dynamic sectors in which education is not enough supply of seats.
The positive impact on wages
As well as the surgeon will have trouble with the work in the country, where there is a shortage of anesthesia, the addition of between the French and the migrants are causing the arrival of immigrants have a positive impact on wages and employment of french workers.
Giovanni Peri so calculated that the growth of migratory movements on the 1% of a long - term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of its immigrants contributes to creating ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalised immigrants between America 's Nobel Prize; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were based immigrants).
Migrants are also in european countries net contributors social systems, on average, at a rate of 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation, e. g., estimates that in Germany one immigrant arrived at the age of 30 years will bring in my whole life in public budgets net contribution (revenue minus costs) 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his mandate, the desire for missing percent growth `` with bared teeth ''.
The teeth to deter immigrants to effect the reverse.
Europe invented democracy, to think about european democracy
Democracy is a rare and very fragile goods.
The european continent ought to remember, nevertheless, that her in Athens before two thousand years has experienced in the course of the 20 th century the tragedy of the world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust and the Gulag, but also by Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Greece.
Some people may believe that, in order to democracy finally triumphed over their foes, will be enough to carry out the election and make it the most direct way.
He knows, however, since Napoleon, that it was the ease of thinking.
The general election law, even though it is a condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and could become `` instrument of oppression, ''as he once said the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: the public space, public spirit, values, the organisation department and control of the power of education, the Enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe, which we are experiencing, it is the economic crisis, but it 's just so, since the beginning of the crisis policy and democracy.
The errors of the greek referendum - yes - no will have in this respect the value of double revelation: the discovery of the need for a return of political power, but also reveal a dramatic sense of his inability, his inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thinking, so that it can be overcome.
The truth is, the front line of the democratic contest today moved and that many of the republican fighters firing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain, if we require a number of national referenda organised by necessity, and in a disorderly way.
A blank issued by the absolute monarch or jump with bound feet into the depths of the nationalist: what kind of selection for the citizen!
No, we do not want the guillotine, but common, a fully - fledged, peaceful and continuity of selection and democracy, this time at the european level.
The crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, nor is he did not know where the stop - because of the crisis in Europe.
It 's all of Europe - eared prior to the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies, which are suffering from their incompetence and their lack of solidarity.
It is not the whole of Europe, which is on the international stage.
About the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it 's all of Europe, which is gradually losing its sovereignty and each of its peoples.
It is urgently needed to return to the european project democratic sovereignty.
As the only together will be able to reduce the weight of their debts of Europeans, to get rid of the markets and investing in the future.
The exit from the crisis will assume the decision at european level, which can not be taken without the full democratic legitimacy, otherwise would have led us to disaster.
After what we have long fought against the motion of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, all now calls the european economic government.
So be it.
But to think that without a stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such people, it would be a folly and new cul - de - sac.
We have to take on a new stage of the building.
In order to make the Republic in France, it was necessary to `` be ''Republicans.
The revolution in the interests of the could not be enough.
The lesson is to continue.
We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
It will be only by building a Europe more politically democratic, and a real european democratic sovereignty.
Let us be Europeans, to build a Europe.
`` Contactless ''smart cards is spreading
In an atmosphere of opens Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris World 's Fair of smart cards.
2011 should, according to the Cabinet Eurosmart end up increasing global sales of the cards) (bank cards, phone SIM card) on 11% to more than 6 million units.

This year should be sold around the world 460 million smart cards to 320 million sold a year earlier.
Their share should in 2012 still stand (the expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total market for smart cards (6,925 million cards).
After what has been a long time in the wake of the APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
About 26 million bank Visa cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals is adopted.
In France are the beginnings of a more modest: it was issued 400,000 of contactless Visa cards.
But a large commercial chains are working for two.
Carrefour so this year issued a 2.5 million contactless cards Pass MasterCard.
To put a higher gear, from now on, the bank 's memories of his clients.
`` Two large french companies are committed to distribute systematically in the future of their clients the proximity of a bank card, ''said Gerard Nébouy, director - general of the Visa Europe France.
The banks are paying a cell phone
But it is just the first stage of the payment of the future: a cell phone.
Technology NFC (near field communication) is necessary for the implementation of the transaction is now equipped with only a small number of instruments.
`` Delay ''.
`` But the real boom would occur in the next year. ''
`` For the year 2012 we estimate their sales in the world to 80 to 120 million units, ''says Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmartu.
But the banks are already gearing up front.

The bank BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société générale yesterday announced that is preparing to introduce a proposal to allow its customers to pay a cell phone bezdotykově.
The terrorist line ranges from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris troubled ties between Al - Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and sect Boko Haram.
The long - term suspicion that there are volumes of the terrorist group Al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and Niger sect Boko Haram is confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Director of the Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that the Algiers on that from now on `` security ''.
`` The way in which the two organisations operate, and intelligence reports indicate that between them, there is a great cooperation, ''he said, without further explanation.
It seems that Paris has a similar analysis.
Investigation into the abduction of two frenchmen in Niger in January 2010, could help shed light on the catwalk.
After they were abducted by members of the AQMI from a restaurant in Niamey, should be Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory of the following day, killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers in an operation carried out by french special forces.
In the rubble after the intervention of the french and nigerian investigators found several phones with chips due to the terrorists.
The terrorist axis
An analysis carried out by call leads to a number of persons in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to the station, Radio France Internationale (RFI) are interested in investigating a particular number two: one leads to Nigerians, who took a long stay in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, which is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to the man, who is said to have close to AQMI and sect.
`` It 's progress, but it should be no doubt a more convincing evidence before we start talking about the operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko ''.
`` But it is possible. ''
`` We have for years, that the sect to external financial and intellectual support and that is reflected in a more proactive, ''says the Nigerian Kunle Amuwo investigator.
In recent months, this `` aid ''more and more apparent in the development and statements of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which now include human victims or the growing complexity of explosive devices in the same way, such as those used by organisations AQMI.
The international community on the forehead with Washington since then put pressure on Nigeria, in order to take into account the problems raised by the Boko Haram.
The nigerian authorities, in fact, long considered the group for the Community of enlightened mystics nice little interest.
The rapid success
Sect Boko Haram was established in 2002 in Maiduguri around mosques, schools and fundamentalists Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which, in the language of the haoussa means `` western education is a sin '', approves the establishment of islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region has such a rapid success.
Sect are politicized and requires strict adherence to islamic law šaria, while her supporters on the fight against the `` central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, the followers of Boko Haram become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
The government 's response, as always, is still the same.
The army will surround the city, and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf was captured and killed in prison.
Since that time, a group of radicalized and leave their posts in the north.
On Christmas Day 2010 is carried out in the city of Jos bombing that killed 80 people, then another in the capital Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks on police HQ in its first suicide attack.
And in August, the local office of the UN 's first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should result from Mauritania across Nigeria to Somalia, from now are concerned about all the security specialists.
Now, when Al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb hemmed in Mali and iger and Somalis from the Al - Shabaab militia operating in Kenya, the Boko Haram appears as a new danger for the continent.
Last week in Nigeria in a conversation with President Goodluckem Jonathan Alain Juppé said that France is in a state of alert and is ready to `` to hand over all the information ''.
The world according to the candidates for president
In matters relating to China, Iran or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry on simplification and knowledge.
Can America weakened by the crisis to manage the world by simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the presidential candidates, voters might think.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other repeat the stormy marriage and concise instructions on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
Often unfounded slogans about China, Iran or aid to Israel between them.
Mitt Romney, the best that placed candidate in the race for the republican nomination, `` the Grand Old Party '', said the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and their accusations `` due to manipulate their currency'', which is the topic in America inflamed the migration of parts of its industry towards Asia.
Worse than that, if this must include the start of trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former Obama 's ambassador to China, and the only candidate with a high - tech vision of foreign policy, was almost caught in a position to `` smooth ''emotions.
A tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama 's).
But Huntsman, who are in last place in the electoral estimates, remains transparent.
The image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
`` If I am elected, into Iran, ''said fanfarónsky.
`` If Obama is re - elected, they will have the bomb. ''
He promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing him to Obama, that he had failed in its obligations to the partner.
A businessman Herman Cain, the second best umístivší candidate, shows an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the documents.
Recently called for a position against the chinese military threat, because Beijing `` trying to develop nuclear capability ''- apparently unaware of the fact that China 's own nuclear weapon since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strikes against Iran, says that he is prepared to send american troops to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned Obama in 2009 is also recommended Caine, Perry and the other candidate Michele Bachmann.
All are far away, than he was in 2008 republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president, they say, that Reagan was too easy ideas and still won the Cold War.
Recall that Obama himself was an amateur, and that the added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
Highlighting the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the abrupt departure of `` boys ''from Iraq, his excuses for Libya and attach the label of a weak
But the attack is not simple.
The population is a national security policy of President Obama, who removed the Ben Laden, more positively.
From Iraq does not have the confidence to military intervention, which lead to a quagmire.
And with that, it is necessary to rebuild America economically, in order to resuscitate her leadership, Obama 's in the right place.
Nord Stream, a new entry port of russian gas to Europe
Remote the Nord Stream gas pipeline connecting directly to Eastern Europe to Russia and the Baltic Sea to work.
They must deliver gas equivalent to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the russian gas giant, to this event due to celebrate.
More than 500 guests, among them 4 heads of state and government, the last Tuesday, attended the inauguration of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline, which under the sea directly linking Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, german Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned jointly control valve around the entrance of russian gas to western european network.
This new pipeline flow each year to Western Europe 27.5 billion of additional cubic meters of russian gas pipeline on the length of the 1, 224 km of the region of St. Petersburg and the federal state Mecklembursko - Western Pomerania.
The pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is the amount that is equal to the entire french consumption.
And there are no longer recalls the chance to build a third line of the gas pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom is the timely completion of this huge construction of the nature of the victory.
The project strongly protested against Poland and the baltic countries.
Nord Stream, in fact, to supply gas directly to Germany without being held around the country a third state (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing a bit of power: the possibility of pushing for Russia threatening to shut down access to western european markets, it becomes more difficult.
Hard to Warsaw, when she likened the Nord Stream for `` new of the german - soviet Pact '', with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in 1939.
Does it mean that it is a politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe through its support for the russian project in it has gained greater security for their purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening of Europe 's energy, because the project has created a rift between Europeans from the east and west.
Russia had barely five years ago to promote his vision of a close alliance between Russia and the rich western countries with high consumption of gas, whose deposits are coming to an end.
`` This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, the new line, which connects us organically, ''said François Fillon at the opening of this pipeline, and has demonstrated, at what point are large gas contracts things both political and economic.
All of this explains the leaders of Gazprom 's present in large numbers in Lubmin, the place of gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical offence.
An undersea pipeline is made of steel, cement, in order to protect the marine vessels.
Lies at the bottom of the sea in the average depth of 200 m.
In its construction was necessary to avoid the originating from the time of World War II.
`` For the safety of them had to be almost a hundred removed or destroyed, ''says Jens Mueller, a spokesman of the Nord Stream.
It should also be increased measures for the protection of flora and fauna.
The pipeline is a long metal snake as 242 Eiffel Tower, which at its full length is nowhere to be suspended or valves or stations maintenance.
One of the platform to be constructed in the vicinity of Sweden, but the project leader rejected it, when the swedes were just a few greedy see the russian state company, how to permanently settle in their coast.
`` In the event of failure to stop the gas for less than 1 minute, ''says Jens Muller.
In the case of the leaking gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is builders considered unlikely, he welds was designed so that the leak was once every 100,000 years.
The gas pipeline from the outside by a robot submarine drawn by ships, while the interior of the gas pipeline is controlled by the device, which is circulating inside.
This device cigar - shaped by an average of 1 meter is introduced to the inside of the line and is led by gas.
In goal after three days of travel at the speed of 3 m / s will provide accurate information about the possible distortion of metal.
Remote gas pipeline is designed to work for 50 years, without any need to repair.
The circulation of the gas is simply to ensure the pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar in goal.
For the implementation of this project joined forces five companies.
The remains of Gazprom, which holds a 51%.
It was joined by the german company E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the dutch company Gasunie and the french group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has its headquarters in the town of Zoug in Switzerland, where taxation is extremely beneficial.
Gazprom subsequently this company rented for five years, which can be renewed, all of its capacity for the transport of gas.
`` Gazprom will profit from a total capacity, whether it is the reality of the gas any '', explains Jens Muller.
Funding for the construction of the gas pipeline was assured of 30% of shareholders and of 70% of the bank loans.
The total cost of the work would have to 7.4 billion euros for the pipeline.
For the group GDF Suez and investment costs rise up to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are aware that their costs will return, because of the risk of takes only Gazprom.
A gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy beach with pine forests.
The valves high 15 feet is the exit gate of the gas.
Sensors measure the temperature, pressure, and other characteristics of the gas, before he was transported to the german gas pipelines.
Since the last Tuesday of this terminal accepts every hour of one million cubic metres of russian gas.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine notebook - brand
The italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to provide the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of candles.
Moleskine notebook is easy to see his black rectangular slabs and their leaves, dingy white paint as if time senescent.
He Moleskine notebook, such as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The italian firm Modo Modo located in Milan, at the time, decided to launch the new design, but a notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the enterprise, taking on the launch of a new product.
The book was inspired by an old production technique of `` moleskin ''(imitation leather), which is used for the bench.
This type of book was a writer and traveler.
`` Moleskine returned to the popularity of old and forgotten, was an icon of avant - garde artists until the 20 th century, ''says Maria Sebregondi, which has since become a leading brand in the company Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010 have increased sales by 26% in the last year to 12.7 million.
The situation is far away from the production of the early years, when there were only 3 000 notebooks.
Moleskine exceeds the italian border, and exports are up to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw up a portrait of the buyer, since the book takes a businessman as well as a student or professionals.
The image of the Moleskine notebook belonging to his owners are people cosmopolitan, sophisticated and an open mind.
The italian company, which in its infancy had 12 employees, it 's almost a century and since 2008 has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
Their notebooks circulate in bookstores and through chains FNAC in small boutiques in the centre of the city, where he could assert their identity.
`` We watched the spirit of the moment, and the need for a new post, through the development of e - mails, ''explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine notebook: the recently opened exhibition, `` make way '', where architects and artists exhibiting his notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno also introduced the new board book like a leopard.
Moleskine benefited from his success and the cultural aura and diversify its products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebooks to... make extends to a wide range of media.
The success of that envy: in the fall of 2006, the firm was Modo Modo bought investment funds SG Capital Europe today, Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of the Moleskine.
Why is such a high proportion of the unemployed disabled workers?
Around 19% of people looking for work.
Today 's opening week 15 for the employment of disabled.
Despite the proactive public policy established in 2005 is the percentage of unemployed people still more than twice that of the average, i. e. 19% compared to 9% for the whole population.
It 's a depressing?
`` No, underlines the Éric Blanchet, director - general of the Association of Adapt, which organises the week for the employment of people with disabilities. ''
`` The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable. ''
`` At the time, it was the percentage of unemployed twice, but three times higher. ''
`` However, it is still much to do. ''
It must be said that for unemployed people, there are still many obstacles before entering the work.
This is an older person: 37% of the more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% have graduated from high school and from 2.3 million students of the university 's only 10 000 handicapped.
And finally - long - term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that particularly complicated by the return to work and that they are `` core of the problem '', according to Christian Grapina, Director General of the Association of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992, in order to help businesses to adopt disabled workers.
So, as far as the objective of the brake.
Left, ways of thinking, of course, but too slowly.
The study carried out in April by IMS - Entreprendre pour la Cité finds that the managers are `` low level of knowledge about disabled people ''with `` an exaggerated idea of persons in a wheelchair and psychiatric or mental deficiencies''.
The result is that private businesses with more than 20 employees are still far from that, in order to achieve the objectives of 6% to employ disabled workers laid down in the law of 1987.
The last known figures, which come from R. 2008, the equal of 2.6%.
`` Now we move around 3%, ''says Pierre Blanc, director - general of the Organisation of Agefiph responsible for collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with the law.
The proof is that the number of `` fined ''businesses, as well as the amount paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 culprit companies to 46,000 (and on 606 to 480 million euros).
`` The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, says Pierre Blanc. ''
`` But this improvement also demonstrates a real awareness, particularly in large companies. ''
According to the Ministry of Labour only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 staff are employed by disabled workers, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 200 employees.

To play against Bleus, which encouraged from 7 years and in their victorious campaign in 1998 and 2000.
`` I have always been a fan, ''he says.
This does not necessarily contribute more to the `` special ''nature of this meeting.
The more for it, because, on the other hand, `` are (Mathieu Debuchy), Yohan Cabaye (), Adil Rami (), ''he recalls.
`` We were cruising at once. ''
`` To play against them, it 's just a pleasure! ''
Good - naturedly Leekens said, `` pride ''.
`` Pride ''to fight the `` game - holiday''.
`` Pride ''also noted in the quality of `` neighbors'' that France is a little more than a year after the trauma in the south african city of Knysna `` once again become a team of very high level ''.
`` Laurent Blanc did a great job, ''came greedier things.
Although Belgium will be at the next World Cup, technical footballer would like to see in 2014 in an aircraft with the French direction... Brazil.
`` Our little Belgians will be great, ''he underlined.
`` Just something we are building, players are ambitious, they have a healthy appetite. ''
`` You realize that for the next games. `` ''including that against France.
Portugal very self - confident
The Portuguese coach Paulo Bento opens with great optimism - Offs against Bosnia Bosnie (22 h 00) this Thursday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams missed realism.
`` At the end of the 90 minutes we are happy the team and, in particular, the lucky country ''.
Paulo Bento is already sees in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt Portuguese national football team, the rudder is from 2010, to qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is lucky in the 90 minutes.
Left to play one game and one opponent - Bosnia.
In a note Friday 's result (0 - 0) in the hell of the bosnian zenice seems clear that nothing is out of the woods.
Portugal is more than an hour, but was not able to give such a rare goal, he said.
`` It 's a good outcome, however, contains the risk, because we are outside the score. ''
But at home on their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that refers to the audience, which should create a boiling pot, even if the game certainly appears to be a `` very cool '', says an optimist, but shrewdly calculated Bento.
`` We expect a very balanced game, but we are confident that we can have the upper hand, ''said the 42 - year - old Portuguese coach.
`` We have still got a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012 ''projects, yet the successor Carlos Queiroze.
The Friday 's game in Bosnia, making the score and win.
The game may be enough Bosnians, who also need to score.
`` It 's a good outcome, however, contains the risk, because we are out of the score, ''he regrets Bento.
`` We are playing against the team that has a lot of technical quality and who has the players with great qualities of the individual, ''he added.
As in zenici will have the interest to develop the bosnian team right from the start of the maximum pressure to `` give him time to think about it. ''
A good idea, provided that this proves to be realistic.
