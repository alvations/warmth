The Stock Exchange of Prague ended with less points at the end of the day 
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Stock Exchange of Prague corrected his losses. 
The deals of the actions of? EZ reached approximately the half of value that they have in the normal day. 
The Stock Exchange of Prague, at the beginnig of the commercial Tuesday, reacted immediately to the Monday fall when it lowered approximately 6 %. 
The descent of this time owes to the fall of the actions in Wall Street. 
Also here there expresses itself the reaction of the market to the result of the voting of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the plan of stabilization of the secretary of the financial sector. 
Fall of the actions in Asia 
The actions of the Asian Stock Exchanges lived on Tuesday through a dramatic fall, although throughout the day the index attenuated finally part of the losses. 
The index of the Stock Exchange Hang Seng of Hong Kong along his financial day marked almost four per cent, although later it attenuated his losses reducing the descent in practically 2,5 per cent. 
The index of Hang Seng China Enterprises that continues the movements of the Chinese actions in the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong lowered 3,8 per cent, in Shangai the markets were closed. 
The actions of Sidney's Stock Exchange lost more than five per cent but, in the end, the losses lowered 4,3 per cent. 
The Stock Exchange of Taiwan according to the secretary of the Index lowered 3,6 per cent. 
" The actions of rescue programmed in the USA are insecure and this influences on the financial market of the whole world ", indicated the Chief of the Office of the mint of Hong Kong, Joseph Yam. 
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, she s�la determines his monetary politics, that is to say, without dependency of Banco Central of China. 
The valuations of interest of Hong Kong are at the same level as those of the United States. 
The American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to the Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal of support to the financial system. 
Otherwise, it threatens with that the falls will do to themselves to feel in other countries. 
Bloody bath of the American actions 
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives pushed the plan of help back to the financial system to which there should devote oneself 700 billion dollars (almost approximately 12 trillions of crowns). 
The legislators, of this form, ignored the invitation of the president George Bush to support his plan. 
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and would help to stabilize the whole economy. 
On Monday, the American actions lived through a bloody bath and principally the index of the actions they gathered the biggest fall in more than 20 years. 
The index of Dow Jones lowered almost seven per cent. A fall of similar volume registered for last time in the year 1987. 
The index descended already before being announced but so soon it showed itself that the proposal of the assembly was not going out forward, the index started falling down freely. 
The congress moves back: The government of the USA can inject 700 billion dollars into the banking 
The tallest representatives of the Congress and of the government, the president George W. Bush, they agreed in an agreement in wide terms of financial help to the American system of finance. 
His voting will be realized at the beginning of next week. 
The American legislators provoked a breach in the conversations on the approval of the plan of rescue in his form of help the financial American system with the quantity for 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 trillions of crowns). 
Nevertheless, it is not gained yet. 
The conferees must perfect some details of the contract before they could do public the final form of the law and of that it is voted. 
The plan of help to the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the Representatives' Assembly. 
He said on Sunday to the agency Reuters, Barney Frank, president of the Committee for financial Services and of the Banking of the Assembly. 
According to some sources, the voting on the plan might be realized in the Senate not before Wednesday. 
According to the economists, the arrival of the ratification of the plan of rescue should represent the reporting of the first psychologically significant factor for the revitalizaci�n of the financial market. 
Later, nevertheless, it will go over to the "desencantamiento" thanks to the complex mechanisms which help to the market will reach also in the practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
" We have realized a big advance. 
We solve our discrepant opinions with regard to the form that must have the bundle of measurements for the stabilization of the market " the democrat Nancy Pelosi� commented to the agency Bloomberg. 
According to her, the final voting might still be realized on Sunday. 
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night the Minister of Finance, Henry Paulson, to give him a definitive form to the Fund of the government. 
This one should buy of the financial societies the not sold mortgage assets that take the financial companies to hard losses and threaten the stability of the whole system. 
" We are on the verge of closing the agreement on the plan, which will work and also it will have to be effective on the market. 
It is necessary to continue still with the plan of sanitation, but I believe that we are already in it ", said Paulson. 
A sign for the Asian business 
The financial global crisis affects expressly on the market of actions that go down with rapidity. 
According to the democratic senator for Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing everything possible so that the Congress approves definitively an agreement this Sunday. 
They want with it to calm the business of the investors before the Asian market of finance since these are those who are in the first time zone and where the Congress might influence the Monday commerce. 
Nevertheless, for the time being there is nothing clear with safety on when they will vote for two cameras of the American Congress and, not even, if they will not stagnate in the last moment with any problem. 
The legislators believe that it will be approved in the next days. 
The law, nevertheless, will suffer a series of changes. 
The entire quantity destined to help to the system must be divided in two parts. 
The first 350 billions have to be to disposition as soon as possible, such and since the president George Bush requested. 
Nevertheless, the Congress can block the liberation of the remaining quantity if it had the impression of which the program does not expire with his function, which would talk each other about another 100 billion dollars and, later, about the last 350 billion dollars. 
Bush valued the advance of the meetings 
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but the Congress can overcome his veto for a majority of votes. 
In spite of these changes there survived the basic idea of the program that was consisting of gaining financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage qualifications which value fell down because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not capable of stopping paying his mortgages. 
" We have worked quite. 
The representatives' Assembly would have to be prepared to vote for the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday ", mentioned the republican senator, Judd Gregg. 
Also the American president Bush is satisfied by the advance of the meetings. 
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied by the Saturday advance and that it values " the determination of both parts for stabilizing our financial market and protecting our economy ". 
Limitation of the armored contract 
The president of the bank Committee of the senate, Christopher Dodd, chief of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the money of the program for the protection of the taxes of the taxpayers of his losses, a closing ceremony aliviadora of the plan of finance programmed. 
The new law has to limit also the so-called contracts reinforced for the directors of the taking part societies of the program, and creates a committee that will have a control of the Fund. 
East would have to direct the Department of Finance. 
" We have been employed very hardly at it, and have realized a big advance in direction of the agreement that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all the Americans ", mentioned Paulson. 
The plan counts also in spite of helping the owners of houses to have problems with his payments. 
The government would have to put oneself in accordance with the new payments of the mortgages that he buys in order to lower the monthly charges of the payments by instalments of the debtors and to make them possible that they could remain with his houses. 
Marek: psychological help 
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Homeland Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult. 
" And it is for this for which it is not known with what mechanism and at what price they will buy the problematic assets. 
This will be decisive for the share-out of the losses between the financial sector and the government ", said Marek this week, for the servant iHNed.cz. 
That the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week it is not, according to Marek, so excellent. 
" Much more important the fact is that, already this week the conferees agree in his support and give him his seen well everything it before be able. 
This important and psychological agreement of which it goes over to this approval is, in these moments, the most important thing ", insisted Marek. 
It fights to armed hand: the Breeding animal of MP3 against the mobile. 
We advise him to choose like 
Whereas almost everything mobile reproduces files of MP3, no breeding animal of MP3 manages to do calls. 
What seems clear of that it is better to buy to him only the phone. 
Nevertheless sufficient motives exist as so that the man acquires only the breeding animal. 
The election depends practically on the way of his use and on the demand of the proprietary future. 
Probably it will be difficult that he acquires the most modern record player to listen in him to the last album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the other hand this type of musical products like they are the discs of LP they do not go out already, and as for his quality exists not even only one reason objetiva to keep on buying them. 
If the discs of vinyl crowd in his shelves with music of art rock, jazz or blues, probably he is dreaming, at least, of this type of record player. 
This is the same with the music that the compressed music is of way, that is to say, simplified - the music in MP3. 
And here there exist categories of price and quality. 
For some it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns in a breeding animal, the same like for a lover of Pink Floyd that hardly will prove the helmets of flea market of to twenty crowns. 
Two ends, between which there is sufficient space for each one. 
The election is wide. 
Also he decides the duration of the battery 
Some of the best breeding animals is obtained by them much more that only to reproduce music and even what not even the majority of the mobiles. 
No current device is so universal as the phone. 
Opposite to the most elementary functions as telephoning, sending messages, it can reproduce music and video, record the two, has a better or worse device of photography and it even can manage to sail. 
And when we take in consideration the Smartphone and the PDA are going to have in his pocket also a small computer. 
This is a small miracle since no icebox can do a mixed grill and any television it can photograph. 
The universality of the mobiles brings to us also disabilities. 
All the more functions use in the mobile earlier the indicator of the screen will be illuminated asking to be overloaded. 
And the reproduction of music is one of the biggest greedy-guts of energy. 
Few ones are the mobiles that manage to reproduce music more than ten or twelve hours, the majority much less. 
In this sense, the breeding animals of music (especially the simplest) have clearly a major yield. 
That's why, bear in mind that the cheap mobiles will not reproduce any more than two hours. 
If in addition to this, above, they call constantly be still obtained, for more safety, a loader for the work - this is valid also for the most expensive devices. 
With the breeding animal of MP3 this problem is not going to have it, since even the worst last as minimum 9 hours of uninterrupted functioning after a load. 
Another problem happens on having recorded music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal conector USB and, also, not all of them it can get connected directly to the computer without a special software. 
Surely it is possible to record music directly in the card of memory but only in some reading units without reduction there can get connected the small cards of memory that are used in the mobiles. 
In the breeding animals, with any exception (iPod), no special software is necessary. 
It is enough to fill the device with music across the USB of the computer. 
The majority of mobiles and breeding animals believe alone his order in the musical library as the name of the interpreter, title of the album, genre or also according to the user's evaluation. 
Some devices only show a directory with structure of tree similar to a Searcher of Windows and some of them recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, the intelligent phones with operating system). 
The breeding animal tries to serve, the mobile knows more 
For the election of a concrete team be interested in the resistance of the battery, the capacity of the memory, the quality and the type of sound exit and, of course, the serviceability of his handling. 
If he listens, especially, to the music as fund and is going to listen to her every day only a little bit, like in the tramcar, then there is enough to him any mobile that it reproduces. 
What practically obtains truly any mobile. 
It has not even to to be interesting of the format that the mobile or the breeding animal reproduce the music. 
They all reproduce the MP3 and, practically, almost all the music that comes to him will be in this format. 
He is between the most widespread and excepting to him the absolute majority of the devices they reproduce music in format WMA. 
Less they include the format AAC (format used by the company Apple and his iPod). 
The best mobiles make possible also, for example, the buy of music on-line. 
He is enough by means of the Internet of the mobile to visit the competent pages of the operator (or of any other lender of services) and to buy to him a song or an album. 
This service might be for yes only an argument of weight to acquire a mobile for music. 
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is miserable and the majority limits itself only to the topics of fleeting success of the radioes. 
The prices are not the lowest either. 
Nevertheless, in general, it is supposed that precisely this way of selling of music (be already for GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in the future will dominate the industry of the music. 
The majority of the people always takes above a mobile. 
Whenever he feels like listening to something, it will find the mobile in his pocket, whereas the breeding animal of MP3 will remain forgotten in house. 
Nevertheless, it still depends if it always takes with it a few earphones or, at least, the handsfree. 
If it is not like that, it can use an integrated breeding animal that has practically every mobile although a breeding animal of MP3 is like a minimum. 
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be his price. 
The cheapest cost normally less than three thousand. 
Between three and four thousand crowns he can already acquire a good Walkman. 
To the majority of you it will limit the absence of an entry for classic earphones. 
The best, even as for the technical part, as the phones equipped with an entry of 3,5 mm. for a few classic earphones, they cost up to fifteen thousand. 
Again, the advantage of the breeding animals is not another thing than his easy service. 
The simplest breeding animals - by no means necessarily the cheapest (to see our selection) - any person handles them really. 
The minimal functions, his handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the record players it is clear. 
It does not represent a threat to the effect that for mistake we get connected to Internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic account for descent of information. 
For which device to decide 
Even the cheapest mobiles (for example, the Vodafone 527) they usually have a slot to change the card of memory (type M2, mike SD, etc.). 
Even with the buy of a suitable card it will come to two thousand crowns. 
Nevertheless, be careful. 
The basic models, normally are equipped only with a card of 2 GB of maximum capacity. 
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB. 
If it already has a mobile and a cheap breeding animal of MP3 wants still to be bought, throw a glimpse to Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver. 
According to the capacity (as maximum 2 GB) is not necessary to spend any more than 1.100 crowns. 
If you consider of between the most demanding lovers of the music throw hand of the most specializing mobiles - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 what does a service as comfortable as that of the same breeding animal. 
The most specializing of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles of the line Walkman take almost identical use as that of a breeding animal of MP3 independently. 
The same service and the same category as for price, on four thousand crowns, but with a major capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and of battery (normally of 15 hours, with a maximum yield of up to 35 hours), the said mark more mule train brings to them breeding animals of MP3. 
The first virtual operator is already going to come, this year, to the Czech Republic. 
Probably 
The market of mobiles in the Czech Republic is developed enough and our operators offer practically all the services as his associates of Western Europe. 
Nevertheless, here we lack still - the virtual operator, that those it would force to to be cheaper. 
Probably it is not going to be late in coming. 
That the Czech operators are a part of the most expensive of Europe, already we have written it in mobil.cz. 
Did the rest confirm also the Office of the Czech Telecommunication (? YOU) that was alert to that the price of the messages SMS in our country belongs to the most expensive of the whole Union. 
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of the valuations of roaming probably go over to a paradoxical situation - for some clients of the mobile Czech operators the SMS who send from the foreigner they will be cheaper than if they send them from house. 
How is it possible that the prices in the Czech Republic stay so high compared to Europe? 
The response is a simple, lacking competition that really wants to fight. 
Probably this seems to us paradoxical, since we have three networks of mobiles and his high coverage is of more than 100 %. 
On the contrary, the operators of mobiles are desirable to complain that on the Czech market there is an extreme competition. 
Of it also the president of the Council of the Czech Office of Telecommunications (? YOU), Pavel Dvo? �k, either it expressed that either there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator. 
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network it already does not have too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be difficult well to find some frequency). 
Nevertheless, a possibility exists still - the virtual operator. 
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator in the market of the mobile telephony brought an out-standing descent of prices to which the classic operators should have reacted also. 
At the same time, before the entry of sharks as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market of Great Britain similar voices were still listened so much there as here. 
It was demonstrated that place exists for this type of operators and that they can have success. 
For the rest, it is not necessary to look for examples too much far. 
In February of this year we inform them about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland. 
Only after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100 thousand clients and to turn into the fifth biggest operator of the nearby country. 
On the other hand, after Mobilking there is the group Penta who, apart from it, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon. 
The advantage of the virtual operators is in the possibility of more groups concentrating on many put concrete. 
Also, so that they could work of effective form, it is enough to them with many less clients than a classic operator. 
They do not take with it relatively big expenses in construction, functioning and maintenance of the network. 
In the world this type of virtual operators normally are outlined by low expenses - offer calls and messages of cheap SMS that nevertheless, often are resisted by the offer of the most exact services. 
This way, for example, mobile Tesco in Great Britain offers SMS as minimum the half of bargain sales with regard to the competition. 
Nevertheless, since it shows the example of Mobilking in Poland it can be a good blow also the bet for a not trivial at all group puts. 
This operator goes specifically to the man. 
" The correct man chooses Mobilking - he is the operator who pleases and in whom it is possible to trust ", says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, that this virtual operator works. 
It is difficult to say if similar concept as that of Poland might hook in our country. 
It does there doubt the spokesman of Vodafone, Miroslav? epick �: " The Czech market is relatively small to gain access for segments on which there are based the majority of the virtual operators. 
Also from the point of view of the offer of services it is relatively saturated " 
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say the operators of mobiles 
Nevertheless, it seems almost sure of that if in the Czech Republic there will be some virtual operator this it will not be Mobilking. 
" We are speaking on the expansion of this successful project, nevertheless, in R. Czech does not seem too encouraging. 
Rather is it a question of the throwing of Mobilking in other countries of our region ", he said in telephone conversation for mobil.cz, Jana Studni? kov�, spokesman of the financial group Penta. 
Indirectly he made sure that the current operators of mobile telephony in the Czech Republic definitively do not incline before this idea. 
Rather the opposite, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises. 
Interest on the throwing of a virtual operator of mobiles already shows the group GTS Nonedge that it wanted to pass further on to turn into a real competition of Telephone O2 in the field of the clients of companies. 
" We have a big interest in it, to be able to offer to our clients not only services of fixed telephony but also of mobile telephony. 
And as soon as possible, better. 
With this possibility we have met repeatedly all the Czech operators of mobile telephony. 
With some of them we have managed to advance in the meetings ", said the spokesman of the group, Pavel Kaidl. 
Then, perhaps they sparkle better times. 
It seems that, for information not officials, the first official operator would have to come possibly already at the end of year. 
But for the time being his appearance is accompanied of an impenetrable wall of silence. 
" In these moments we believe that the situation is suitable for the appearance of a virtual operator on the Czech market. 
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market. 
Even the present has nobody gone to us with any complex and serious project in this area ", it expressed for mobil.cz, Vlastimil Mr.? and?, spokesman of Telephone O2. 
Of the especificidad of the Czech market other operators refer. 
The spokeswoman of T-mobile, Martina Kemrov�, in exceptional conformity with the opinion of O2, adds: " Up to today we have not registered any commercial viable project that, bisideways profitable, could keep on developing. " 
And he adds: " In the network of T-Mobile it will be difficult to find some virtual operator until the ends of the year. 
In this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that was possible to study in so short horizon " 
Vodafone directs his attention rather to the fulfillment of the proper requests of a license 3G. 
Miroslav? epick � adds: " We are opened for the negotiations with active virtual potentials, and this as for the share-out of expenses and infrastructure. 
Precisely we consider it to be the biggest contribution from the point of view of the clients. 
The principal strategy of Vodafone in this field is in the associate in spite of whom establishing a network shared for a rapid Internet in the mobile. " 
Responsible offices - with the operators fingernail and meat 
The progress of the operators of mobiles can be understood easily, but the entry of another operator would mean to increase the competition what it would bear to a descent of prices and with it, to a descent of the profit. 
Then: why to facilitate the entry to the competition? 
When the operators want to obtain something, they are capable of pulling the same rope, test of it is the grip when it arose U:fon. 
Perhaps the biggest pressure to? YOU it was in the moment of the entry of U:fon for the society T-Mobile. 
Does the public accessible information testify it on the web pages of? YOU. 
But precisely now U:fon serves as argument of why a virtual operator does not accept. 
Martina Kemrov� adds to this: " Also, the competitive ambience on the market of the mobile telephony was opened not for a long time to the fourth operator. 
As for the character of the market of the mobile telephony in the Czech Republic is natural that the entry of another player in the market would suppose for him and, especially, for his big services requests. " 
It is for this that this access to the operators of mobiles is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute lack of interest of the regulatory Czech organ. 
Is not it a question only of the position of the? YOU, which unfortunately does not have any competition in intervening in the commercial tenders, in contrast to Great Britain and other developed countries. 
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (�OHS). 
Nevertheless, this one expressed his typical position before this problems. 
" The entry of a virtual operator to the market of the mobile telephony would be possible after there was closing an agreement on the rent of the necessary infrastructure between an operator of mobile telephony and a virtual operator. 
Up to today no agreement has been an enclosure since the offer of the interested potentials rather was not the sufficiently interesting thing for the classic operators ", he added to our question Kristi�n Chalupa, of the department of exterior Relations of the �OHS. 
These formulated declarations do not surprise the representatives of the operators. 
For the offices that must represent the interests of the consumers it is a question of something more than a consideration, apart from it they must observe that nobody should take advantage of his position on the market. 
Especially when Kristi�n Chalupa adds: " Abroad where the virtual operators work with normality we can observe that his entry in the market contributed to the descent of prices of the services of mobile telephony " 
Clearly, the pressure as for the correct functioning of the means of the market and the descent of prices they do not enter inside the interest of the �OHS. 
Really the dramatically shocking thing in all this case rests on the dissonant reactions that result from three mobile operators. 
The question of if really it is a question of a coincidence, offers for yes alone. 
It is the same like with the price of the gasoline in the gas stations since it is clear that it is a work of the coincidence and of a hard struggle for the competition. 
" The Office in this sense has not found signs of disloyal competition and does not have therefore somehow motives for intervening. 
None of the operators has a domineering position consequently they do not have a corresponding ascent of responsibility in his performances on the market. 
The necessary hardware to open the market of the mobile telephony to the virtual operators, rather, is absent, as well as the regulators of telecommunication ", he added to his response Longboat. 
The interpretation on the domineering position on the market is one of many difficult points. 
Clearly does an analysis of excellent markets exist prepared by? YOU according to whom the telecommunications are from the point of view of the commercial tender a bought only one. 
In this type of market naturally none of the Czech operators has a domineering position. 
Nevertheless some of the legal experts offer another vision - so that it arises a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement with the manager of the network. 
And the operator of the mobile telephony - with all his logic - has the monopoly of his network. 
Therefore, in a concrete segment it must be necessarily domineering. 
And if this argumentation was not accepted, at least for �OHS it should represent a warning the fact that three operators of mobiles climb llamativamente of similar form. 
The current complaints of the interested ones (inluida the said society GTS Will nonsee) show that in all the negotiations with the operators they are shocked by many similar impediments. 
To load the responsibility in? YOU it is a quite common trick in the field of the telecommunications of which the �OHS washes its hands in all this matter. 
We have met him already in some similar cases. 
Unfortunately not long ago was a new amendment presented to the law of telecommunications for the enlargement of the competition of? YOU in the field of the commercial tenders that it did not take to effect, even if a series of specialists promised that the situation would improve. 
The representatives of �OHS must know this perfectly, but it is clear that his interests are in another part. 
Everything is fine, when nobody looks 
At the same time, inconspicuously there keeps on working something like pseudovirtual operator that in the Czech networks of mobile telephony they exist already a few. 
They are companies that put their own prices to the services of mobile telephony that, nevertheless, only a part are public. 
Normally it is a question of companies that dedicate to the marketing multilevel. 
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others many offer their own services of mobile telephony. 
Normally only elected some of them obtain the price-list of these companies. 
The magic is in that the company, with regard to the operator, acts as a classic managerial client of the same one entrusting a big quantity of cards SIM. 
As special client will receive later special prices and other offers. 
The problem is in that the commercial conditions in all the Czech operators of mobile telephony proh�ben this type of resale. 
" If cases as that were discovered he quotes it might speak about infraction in the conditions of contract that might be translated in the end of the collaboration with the society given ", he answered to the question on this problem Martina Kemrov�. 
But it is quite improbable that an activity of this type realized on the part of the operators of mobile telephony will not come to the responsible people. 
Precisely in case of three said companies it can go so far as to be a question of thousands of clients. 
None of the operators is against of this procedure. 
With the activities of these companies they obtain a few profit not despicable at all and, at the same time - in contrast to the authentic virtual operators - by no means they threaten their own official marketing. 
Miroslav? epick � he warns us of the possible problems: " the law allows a speculation of this type, nevertheless, the services of this company are used only for contemptibly so much per cent of clients. 
These, also, must accept that the card SIM of his phone is not to his name from what they cannot have absolutely him as a normal client of the operators. " 
Precisely is this what should to him seem to? Minimally strange YOU. 
Also a new question appears for the �OHS. 
If the fact is that the operators of mobile telephony half-close the eyes in this type of procedure: why do they block the entry of the virtual operator? 
It is necessary to add that the �OHS has the sufficient competition to discover this type of activities and if it is that he is not going to want it must not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators of which they have not even idea of these history and of which his commercial conditions do not allow it. 
When will we stop being the most expensive 
Since it remained already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator in the market of the mobile telephony brought a significant descent in the prices of the services. 
At the same time, practically in all the countries where the virtual operator arose, the classic operators tried to be protected more or less from this irruption. 
The arguments used by these were practically all identically - too small, a market, possibly, too saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc. 
In the most advanced countries, nevertheless, in these moments they have taken control of the regulatory organs and in none of the cases they defended the operators but his clients. 
Already out with formal measurements or informal pressure they achieved that the first virtual operator was arising and with him others started arising. 
Unfortunately, the Czech Organ of Regulation all this case spends it as if it was a question of a nail burning. 
For our experience we cannot stop impressing ourselves of that the confusion of the attributions about these cases they are convenient for them. 
But let's not despair. 
If it is that this information behind the scenes is correct and the virtual operator really comes to these grounds, then the Czech market of the mobile telephony probably starts moving again. 
If some of the operators allows to bring in some virtual operator of mobile telephony it will be difficult that the �OHS could remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of interested others. 
And we perhaps will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Listen to four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem. 
On Sunday, the prime minister Mirek Topol�nek in occasion of the day of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my hearth. 
Did the new anthem record the band of the National Theater under the guidance of Ji? � B? lohl�vek. 
There are to disposition four versions - two versions that are Alone, one to masculine voice and other one to feminine voice different with Choir and instrumental other one. 
Of the singing do they take charge Kate? ina Kn?? �nkov� and Adam Plachetka. 
Are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem Otakar Jeremi�? and Jaroslav Kr? ek. 
In the servant iHNed.cz can listen to four versions. 
B? lohl�vek considers this Czech national singing to be one of the most beautiful anthems. 
The Czech Radio already said that before deliberately it chose for the Alone singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular. 
" From the beginning I have tried with the two and later, also, with the Choir that was fixed in the diction so that the text was included well, so that it had consonance ", he mentioned. 
The official Czech anthem celebrates next year his 175 anniversary. 
The song Where, did my Hearth sound for the first time in the year 1834 in the stage of the Theater of the States in the original Czech work Fidlova? ka of Josef Kajet�n Tyl and arranged with the music of Franti? ek? kroup. 
It gained popularity and the people made her his. 
The first strophe of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in the year 1918 turned, of natural form, into a part of the official anthem. 
One of seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic. 
How does the "new" anthem sound 
The MHD of Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip 
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, he writes himself in the history of the Company of Transports of Prague the date in which the first passengers enter the meter, the tramcar and the bus with an electronic bond his pockets instead of a ticket of role. 
East can be acquired in these moments by almost hundred thousand persons who possess the card of chip Opencard. 
Can the passengers buy the bond of 30 days, 90 days and the annual one (this one will be cost from January 1, 2009) and simultaneously load it in his card of chip in the infocentros and positions of the company of transports at the metro stations, Muzeum, M? stek, N�dra? � Hole? ovice, And? l, Roztyly, Let? any, Kobylisy, Rajsk� zahrada, Ka? erov and Luka. 
The bonds can already be bought from yesterday in Internet on the pages of the company of transports, www.dpp.cz. 
The service, until the evening, was used by more than four hundred persons. 
Those that start using the Internet as form of commerce, can start forgetting definitively the positions of selling of tickets at the metro stations, where till now they have to queue regularly a normal ticket was extracted. 
One buys the bond in Internet, and the card Opencard they recharge her to you in some of thirteen branches with the Municipal Library. 
" In these places there is at the disposal of the passengers a window with prepared personnel that helps the interested ones with the buy for Internet and also with it recharges of the bond bought in his card ", said the spokesman of the project, Martin Opatrn �. 
Apart from the library, also it will be possible to recharge the electronic bond in the Opencard in the automatic machines retailers who are in some foyers of the meter. 
How are these vending machines? 
Are they red, they us resemble a machine of stinging tickets and the travelers probably already will have concentrated on them at the underground stations of Roztyly, Bud? jovick�, the I. Pst. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk�. 
" Now there is in the city five but at the end of year there would have to be eighty ", it completed Opatrn �. 
The bond is controlled by the machine instead of the driver 
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple. 
It is enough to introduce in her the card of chip Opencard and the bond previously full will be loaded only in her. 
The electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in his surroundings. 
That is to say, in the trains of beltway and lines of buses from the numbers 300 up to 499 that there use principally the inhabitants of the localities of central Bohemia. 
" In the trains assigned to the integrated transport of Prague there are ticket inspectors equipped with a reading card that will help to confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the bond ", this way he told the control of the tickets, Filip Dr�pal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague. 
The buses of beltway have his reading cards mounted in the box office of the driver. 
On having entered, it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany it on the Opencard in the place destined for it in the side of the Box. 
With it, the driver controls the validity of the bond. 
" If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier that to request the driver this information ", it completed Dr�pal. 
The passengers who do not travel in the buses of beltway and do not remember when it they is it finishes the validity of the bond they can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged. 
Here, on the screen of the machine, one will show them the information about the validity of his document. 
The Southeast they wanted to be a part of the USA in a referendum 
The German Sudetes asked in the year 1945 that He Was smoking it to be a part of the United States. 
This is what is extracted from the letter that is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of Bohemia of the South. 
If we cannot be a part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America. 
With this desire there went, presumably, some groups of Germans of the Sudetes to the president of the USA in the year 1945. 
It results from the letters that keep in a particular file and that today are kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of Bohemia of the South. 
The Germans of? esk � does Krumlov request in a letter to the American president that it does not allow the return of the " ground? umava " - occupied by Hitler based on the Agreement of Munich - again to Czechoslovakia. 
" Have we understood correctly the situation and want really his word from which the American units are coming to German grounds neither not as oppressors nor enemies but as liberating " he is written in the letter, signed with " the people that it takes the destination of? umava in his heart ". 
In sight that the union of Czechoslovakia with the Southeast Germans presumably supposes - according to these the national Czech character - has one hope only in the brutality, lack of consideration, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors ask in the letter to the American president to take up office per today and forever to? umava under a protectorate. 
" We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants it should deliver to us a foreign state that it oppresses and pushes back to the minorities and that by no means collaborates with the victory of the Allied Forces ", he writes himself in the letter. 
The reason for which the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of countermeasures of the " Czech oppressors ". 
If the president of the USA presumably will doubt on this idea of the Germans? umavos, would it be enough to organize in the grounds? umavas a referendum on if his inhabitants want to be a part of the USA or to live under his patronage. 
Although the text of the letter, with the knowledge that we have current of the history of postwar period, can dream about us a little infantile, according to some specialists it paints wisely the expectations of the Germans of the Southeast of then. 
Although the Czech Germans should have known by intuition minimally of that it was going away to treat on his expulsion of the republic only some few ones they were admitting this possibility. 
Some of them hoped that the United States and Great Britain should negotiate for the Sudetes some clear form of autonomy. 
Others believed that they will remain in Czechoslovakia. 
Does the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa confirm it even, been born in? esk� Bud? jovice. 
Was East in the war, as German of Bud? jovice, enrolado in the marina of the Baltic one. 
When at the end of the war the Britons caught it and located it in the field of prisoners of Holstein dozens of Germans went to him so that Czech was teaching them. 
" They believed that, on having returned to house, the Czech would come to them well ", he said Longboat. 
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, was relying on that based on the Decrees of Benes they would be removed from the Republic. 
You do not think: you pay! 
Emotive campaign attacks the drivers 
The most expensive action in the Czech history directed to the safety in the highways. 
This way it might characterize the emotive Campaign that decided to throw on Wednesday the Department of Transports in the means. 
The office of the minister, Ale?? eb�? ek promises that it will dissuade the drivers of dangerous conducts to the frill. 
The campaign of 150 millions will make feel in the television, radio, cinema, Internet and in leaflets. 
It would have to dissuade the driver of the high speed and of the alcohol to the frill. 
And also to remind to them that before be starting the belts stick. 
It wants to come to the conscience especially from the conductive young people, motorcyclists, pedestrians and in last place also from the professional drivers. 
And what is what we can see in the announcements? 
Fundamentally human histories that they assault to the emotions. 
And for it the "bloodthirsty" announcements testify it to us during the whole campaign: 
You do not think: you pay! 
The word " you do not think " is written by big lettering in the registration. 
And in a blood puddle the word is you "pay". 
This must symbolize that the man in a moment of absent-mindedness can go so far as to pay with his own life. 
The announcements are going to " to put fear " to the spectators until the year 2010. 
The Department allowed itself to inspire for the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon grounds where there can be observed strong images of victims of accidents. 
He promises that that way it will reduce the accidents and the number of dead persons in the Czech highways. 
The announcements have been prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
Sugar and whip for the drivers 
" For the drivers it costs the system of sugar and whip. 
Sugar is for him when, for example, a semaphore passes in red and this way it saves time. 
The whip is a threat of fine or accident. 
Is it necessary to remind the risks to the drivers ", says the psychologist of transports of the hospital Na Homolce, Martin Ko? �n. 
And that's why an informative campaign is necessary in the press and principally a negative, concrete publicity the psychologist. 
Less effective, for him, are the panels that they warn to the driver of the dangers. 
" If there is some installed panel warning of some probably prompt danger will it fuse with the ambience and the driver will not give him major attention ", warned Ko? �n. 
Olmert would return almost all the zones occupied in exchange for the peace 
The provisional prime minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, pronounced on the restitution of practically all the grounds occupied in the year 1967, that is to say, West Bank, this Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for the peace with Palestinian and Syria. 
He proposed in the interview that on Monday it appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. 
" We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians what means that necessarily we will have to return almost all the (busy) grounds if it is that not all ", said Olmert to the newspaper. 
" Sure that we will remain with somewhat per cent of these grounds, but to the Palestinians we will have to transfer a similar per cent (of the grounds of Israel) because without this there will not be peace ", he added. 
It admitted that in case of restitution this Jerusalem would be included also. 
" That one who wants safety in Jerusalem and therefore he does not want that the tractors or excavators happen over his legs as it happened to one of my best friends, then will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem ", aimed Olmert in reference to two attacks of July in the city in that there were several dead persons and dozens of persons were hurt. 
According to the president it will be necessary to think " a special solution for the hill of the Temple, sacred and historical place " that he is inside the ancient city. 
" That one that wants to support the Israelite sovereignty in the whole city will have to integrate 270.000 Arabs. 
This will not work ", he insisted further on. 
Retreat of the Golan Heights 
Olmert declared himself also for the retreat of Israel de los Altos del gol�n what from his point of view is an inherent condition to close an agreement of peace with Syria. 
But this would suppose also a few concrete efforts on the part of Damascus. 
" I do not propose to close the peace with Syria only in the base of the retreat of the Gol�n ", he warned. 
" The Syrians know well of what they will have to get rid to gain the Gol�n. 
They will have to leave his current relations with Iran, will have to leave his relations with the Hizbul� (movement chita), they will have to get rid of the permanent support that provokes the terrorism of Hamas (movement chita), of Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and of the Yihad (Holy War) in Iraq ", the prime minister specified. 
You ask after the accident: are the stewardesses illegal in the buses? 
The law is not known, it is not possible to walk in a bus of long distance 
As regards the tragic accident of the bus of the company Student Agency next to the Italian city of Padova us the question arises from if the stewardesses and passengers can move for the bus during the trip. 
" If we wanted strictly and formally to expire with the law, the activity of the stewardess is opposed to the law of road transit ", says the spokesman of the department of Transport, Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week, clearly was caused by the driver of the truck only that the bus crossed in the way. 
The girl, unfortunately, was seated next to the driver in the least sure place of the vehicle in spite of another two places had private rooms. 
Nevertheless, the bus can have an accident or brake suddenly, and in the precise moment in which the azafato distributes the coffee or the newspapers. 
Here what plays the role is if the bus is provided, according to the technical permission, with places of on foot. 
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must go sat. 
Have the buses of long distances of Student Agency no places to go of foot, which there confirmed the director of the company, Radim Jan? ura, to Aktu�ln? .cz. 
" We have solved this with the department and, at first, the movement of the passengers is not allowed. 
Finally they withdrew this and we come to the agreement of which the passengers can go to the bath being the bus in march if it is that they possess seat ", he mentioned to us on his position. 
The stewardess does not know the law 
" There does not exist a legal clear interpretation of the role of the stewardess - no legal disposition clarifies this function. 
Not even any legal disposition prohibits the agents of transports to realize any service. 
The law of transport for highway only knows the term of Ticket inspector of vehicles, which rights and obligations are not defined ", adds, less incisively, spokesman Hanzelka. 
The director of the department of Traffic of vehicles for highway of the Department of Transports, Josef Pokorn �, thinks on the contrary that the law attends sufficiently to this problems. 
" It depends on if the bus has the homologation afforded to have places of on foot. 
That is quite ", he says. 
The buses split between the urban ones, where there are places to be standing up and of maximum limited speed, inter-city with places to be standing up with a major permission of speed and those of long distances without places to go of foot, with the biggest permission of speed and with the seats equipped with safety belt. 
Like in the plane, says the expert 
The expert of BESIP in Security in the transport, Jaroslav Ho? �n, he does not see important problems as for the movement of the azafato in the bus. 
" During the development of the trip there is no great threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service in the planes. 
Here there is not even had the safety from which the turbulencies come and her which the stewardess could bang in the head. " 
" Nevertheless, if the bus brakes suddenly clearly that are valid the physical laws. 
The same like in an urban bus or in the tramcar. 
The safety of the stewardess must solve the internal regulation of the transporter ", he says and also he thinks that from the point of view of the law this problems is without solving. 
Seed drill? ura this service is prepared to annul 
Student Agency is the only transporter who offers the stewardesses' service. 
It uses in him two hundred. 
The director, not after the accident, he thinks this risky work. 
" Nevertheless, at the moment when it has the impression of which the stewardess's position is risked, of that time I will suppress it. 
The coffee and the newspapers can receive it, the passengers, on having entered. 
It would save even expenses ", he says. 
In interest to the safety it is the reason for which Asiana lacks stewardesses in his vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which directs a small line compared to SA. 
" We have no stewardesses, we are against of them from the beginning. 
Earlier or later this will end in a mortal accident ", he said less than one year ago for T�den.cz. 
An enormous tragedy happened 
In the accident of the line that joins Naples there died a young stewardess of Pilsen that had worked for the company two years. 
A Slovene truck that probably turned from the rail of parking blocking the step to the bus. without using the flashing signals. 
His driver tried in a rapid maneuver to avoid it, nevertheless, collided with the right front part. 
Seed drill? ura denies that there should sell two places that are reserved for the rest of the stewardess. 
" These places it is not possible to reserve them for connections of long distances, they are blocked. " 
The company has the intention of demanding the driver of the truck. 
The agency is not going to wait to the verdict of the judgment on the indemnification of the family of the girl but he waits for the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit. 
Reform of the law? 
Not, for the time being 
The reform of the law might bring a major precision on the movement of the stewardess in the bus in whom for one year that there are working thirty expert members of a group of the Department of Transports. 
" Nevertheless, they have not come to any concrete conclusion. 
Do not they devote themselves too much to the buses, but rather to the system of points, maximum speed in freeway and the use of the mobile during the march ", says the expert Ho? �n. 
" The Department of Transport something does not consider to be the activity of the stewardesses that threatens in an important way the safety of the passengers ", ending spokesman Hanzelka, of whom the control of the safety in the buses is a competition of the police and the Office of Security in the work. 
The hope of Dusseldorf rests in Frankfurt 
In the letter of the directorate of the bank West LB for his collaborators big words are not absent. 
For the merger of the units of the bank of Dusseldorf with the bank DEKA it is possible to form `un central market of capitals of the financial group of Sparkassen ', as it says the writing, published on Monday 
The bank West LB, breaking `bloco of competition ' with sustainable capacity of benefits would enter such a business. 
Also, such a merger can be a beginning for following mergers in the ambience of regional banks. 
This way it goes so far as to understand the text, when a directorate wants to show aptitude to act in hard times. 
Because just as earlier the West LB is under an enormous pressure. 
Not only of the part of the European Union, but also of the federal institute of the alertness of the financial services that not long ago has made clear the government of the Rhineland of the Norte-Westfalia that stays a little time to find a solution. 
Already for a time, also of the part of Frankfurt, one speaks very much on the union of such a type between the bank DEKA, which the clients of Sparkasse know for his investment funds, and the West LB. 
To telling truth, Franz Waas, the boss of the bank DEKA, presenting the information after a half year at the end of August allowed to know that he does not see any sense in the merger of the bank, placed in the street Mainzer Stra�e, with a regional bank as for example the helaba or the West LB. 
But the council of administration of the DEKA, which now is composed by the regional banks and the affiliations of Sparkassen, entrusted to directorate to begin negotiations with the West LB on the common commercial activities. 
In this it might treat of a business on the capital market or a few parts of him. 
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, this way it is said in the financial place. 
It is not the first time when it is a question of the consolidation in the ambience of Sparkassen there appears the name of the bank DEKA that with his 3000 collaborators represents between more important businessmen in the financial place Frankfurt. 
In 2003 in a moment the situation seemed so the bank DEKA might fuse with the regional bank of Rhineland - palatinate and with the Helaba. 
This initiative to create an union of three parties stayed without results. 
Scarcely the plans became public, the government of Hesse expressed itself against the participation of the Helaba in this project. 
Others two banks also did not find the same language. 
Instead of that the regional bank of the Rhineland - palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-W�rttemberg. 
But it was always played again with the idea of merger of the bank DEKA with other regional banks. 
But finally G�nther Merl, the president of the directorate of the Helaba, expressed that it was against of the plans of the coexistence with his bank. 
Independent from that it seems clearer that the union of the different banks of the ambience of public law is necessary. 
So, when they are going to spend the elections of the parliament of Baviera, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-W�rttemberg might do progresses. 
For the Helaba that turns out to be not necessarily good news. 
If the pressure to keep on fusing will increase, Helaba will lack the associates to realize that. 
In the south the bank might be alone a young associate, although till now it stood out much better of the financial crisis that they did it the real estate of Stuttgart and Munich. 
Of another part the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Thuringia, which 85 per cent of the Helaba possess, at the beginning of the year avoided the plans of coexistence with the West LB. 
In any case the Nord remains alone LB. 
But such geostrategic reflections form alone sound a part. 
Of another part it is a question of the compatibility of the different bank models. 
In June Merl rose a fundamental question on a commercial model that could guarantee the future for the regional banks, to that the deutsche Sparkassen - und Draft - Verband till now did not give any response. 
In end the West can decompose LB, but this, naturally, is not the proper desire of the bank. 
This way, also in the letter of the directorate of the bank it is said that it would be tried to finding a finished solution for the whole bank 
Since it is possible to combine the coexistence between singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that is going to show the time. 
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as " the weekend of the Italians " 
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third one or the fourth one. 
But this time, Elena attends to him as his fianc�e, and that's why everything seems different, he says. 
Behind them, next to a barrel of 5 liters of beer of mark Kaiser there is constructed an enormous tiger bear that shows to almost 200 participants of Oktoberfest that can produce low sounds in his gullet. 
First Elena gives to Luca a slap, later a kiss. 
From Bologna they came to Verona. 
Of there, of the parking next to the station of trains It Carries Nuova, this night at 23:45 salt three buses, ` direction Munich, the holiday of the beer ', foreseeable arrival at 6:30 a.m.. 
Three buses are foreseen especially for the Italians, a bus is alone for Brazilian. 
In one of the corners of the parking next to his flag they are singing the South American ones, they had already started celebrating at night. 
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is not at all for the Italians. 
To Frame, which takes a long overcoat with a lining of artificial skin and glasses with sideburns of silver color, him these buses belong. 
For five years they come to the Oktoberfest, bearing in mind that only this year there are three jaunts. 
At night in the way over there, during the day in the meadow, to 22.30 the return. 
To happen the night there means only the unnecessary expenses, says Frame. 
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a beer Kaiser that was done according to the law of the purity of the Baviera, insurance of illness and the guide in German - Frame assisted a course of language in Frankfurt. 
At night the buses are already in the way in the freeway with the direction " Brennero " 
There is no beer yet, not. 
Rapidly the calmness reigns in the bus, the travelers are sleeping. 
It is like that well, they will need still the forces. 
For to Brixen and to Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration do another break in the divided highway 8 shortly before Munich. 
Finally, when the group of Marco reckons for the arrival to the 6.30 at dawn in the parking next to Teresa's Meadow, there there are already circa 50 other buses of the whole Europe. 
Elena, Luca and others meet, Frame has his last speech on the way of proceeding. 
First: to put yourselves on a yellow cap. 
There, of the left part " Oktoberfest " is written, nearby in Gothic letter there is the page of the office of Marco's trips in the Internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it". 
Second: " when there are opened the doors of the shop of the campaign, it means that to go! ", it shouts Frame in the dawn. 
" To go! " To go and to occupy the places of behind in the shop of the campaign. 
" Do not take the places of ahead, because we are going to block, and you all with yellow caps do not sit down in the same stool, distributed by any space! " 
One liter of beer, Frame roars, it costs 8.25 euros. 
Do not forget the tip 
Show to the safety people that we have good tone! 
Scarcely it leaves of his place, he will be already busy! " 
Third: " This evening exactly at half after ten you have to come here!: " Have you understood? 
And now they all go away to the Oktoberfest. 
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow caps in the trees, signs of traffic and even in a cartel of the elections of a big People's Party of Baviera. 
It is desirable to be able to recognize the way behind. 
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest who knows each other as " the weekend of the Italians " 
Exact information does not exist on the number of the persons; it is a question of 50.000 persons who do the trip on the Alps and tormentosamente enter the tents, 10 per cent of all came especially this weekend of Italy. 
The police of Munich receive help of seven police officers of the autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help to the Red Cross of Baviera that does a statistics of the present nations, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the Englishmen (next to 60 assistance) and of the Austrian ones they occupy the first place. 
The favorite shop of the campaign of the Italians is this way called Hofbr�uzelt. 
The nights without sleeping for the creditors of Hypo Real you Be 
The bank system of Germany is relatively stable, the federal minister of Finance Peter Steinbr�ck accentuated only last week. 
That well, that the politician should use the word "relatively" and he added that the bank German ambience also will be affected of the critical tendencies. 
And that has happened after weekend. 
Real Hypo you Be (HRE), the financier of real estate of Munich, that is quoted in the index DAX, receive from a consortium of the German banks a credit of billion to be able to do resistance to the turbulencies on the market. 
On Monday a person who knows very well the situation said to Reuters: the credit helps climbed up to 35 billions of euro. 
The part of the capital that Hypo Real you Be is going to use has to throw interest. 
The money comes like from the banks deprived also of those of public law. 
The cause of that there are the losses of the branch Depfa. 
According to a report, the state financiers with the money that was given for the projects in the long term financed only a brief period - what now, because of the suspicion on the markets, is not more possible. 
In the first half of the year the reservation of capital of the bank in cash has fallen down in 95 per cent, 2.37 millions of euro, also the quota of the proper capital slowed down a little from a 1.6 per cent to a 1.45 per cent. 
Compared to the same period of last year the continuos income of financial investments and benefits clear of financial operations fell down up to the zero, the income of imputation for debit and some qualifications of values also those of the dissolution of provisions of the credit business tended to the fall of more than 70 per cent, in 5 millions of euro. 
Only thanks to the high ones and many income of the refunds of the expenses of compensation of the restructuring of the ex-group Depfa as well as the refund of interests as the federal code of taxes and to the business organized for the companies of the consortium, the negative balance it might accuse a deficit with approximately to 16 per cent more. 
After his privatization in the year 1990 the state ex-financier at first got lost in speculations with the industrial credits for the real estate, which was serving as reason for foundation of the bank Aareal. 
Since it was not possible to gain a lot of money with the financing of the state projects, the Defa started devoting oneself intensively to the projects in the ambience of infrastructure and of the financing of the community projects for the private investors and as well as state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and it diversified. 
Now Hypo Real you Be it has to realize amortizations on the value of the branch that will have a " essential material effect " on the consolidated account of losses and profit of the group, is said much imprecisamente. 
It is a fact that the dividends have cancelled. 
Already for the year 2007 they were cancelled to two thirds. 
After the acquisition of the Depfa Hypo Real you Be it turned into an important state and financial financier into the ambience of the infrastructure. 
As the bank does not possess the deposits client, he, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on the refinancing on the interbank market. 
With the failure of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers, which has happened two weeks ago, the authorization of the interbank credits went down essentially because the banks were saving his liquidity. 
Every year Hypo Real you Be need almost 50 billion euros to finance a part of credit portfolios of the Defa of his measurements in the short term for the refinancing. 
According to the report of Hypo Real you Be, the bank covers with a credit the need of the financing of the group for a brief time and the company is assured of " the influence of the international monetary markets that now essentially are not suitable to work " 
Others sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed up to the end of 2009. 
Georg Funke, the president of the directorate of Hypo Real you Be, told that Hypo Real you Be Group he would not need the monetary markets for the foreseeable time. 
The central German bank and the federal institute of the alertness of the financial services (BaFin) depart from the base of which the competitiveness of Hypo Real you Be Group from now it is insured. 
That has to be waited by the shareholders and the creditors of the bank. 
But because of the dynamics and the imponderabilidad of the crisis there is no steadfastness. 
It even is imaginable that is not necessary to need the financing in his finished volume. 
But it is not possible to exclude the opposite case. 
It was covering the voice of which in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, that's why the temporary salvation cannot calm at least worried persons either. 
The price of action fell down to 75 per cent, 3.30 euros. 
The courses of loan, on the contrary, are really well. 
Whereas the priority debts almost do not change, the courses of the loans as the position in the record of the property tend clearly to the fall. 
Affected they are especially the loans of ex-branch W�rttemberg Hypo and with the reason the loans which expirations exceed 2009. 
After the notable growth of the bank crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that Hypo Real affected you Be, the current value of his loans that earlier were an investment for speculations it is necessary to consider as clerk of the stability of the international financial system. 
Whereas the issuing banks, the governments and the banks that are still little affected are ready to support the system, meanwhile it is possible to depart from the amortization of pensions in term. 
Or it is going to happen a little, what one does not risk to imagine anybody - the financial crisis is going to overcome in next 15 months. 
But on having seen the news crossed on the partial estatizaci�n, now the safety that is already in his limit turned into a well-taken hope. 
This is going to be a reason, because the creditors will happen the nights without sleeping, breaking the head on the decision on his isolation of enthusiasm. 
The investors in the short term can still put the final point and use the transport on account piece of news of the losses for next payments of taxes of indemnification of benefits on the change in the future. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent?-Box 
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, 16-year-old girl, had to present oneself in Highschool de Tachibana the girls started laughing: the German is completely "kawaii"! 
What means that? 
Sylvana knows the word of Sleeves - in a report on the exchanges she counts the Japan. 
" The first day in a school in Japan. 
I felt nervous. 
Before going already to the school, it was afraid. 
I live at the edge of Tokyo in the direction Kawasaki and go away in train 40 minutes to Highschool Tachibana. 
Alone he had to find the way, fortunately I did not get lost. 
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not fixed as rigorously as in my house, in Low Saxony. 
From the eight of the morning the pupils come, at twenty of nine it begins a small meeting with the teachers, ' home room '. 
Before it began the class, I had touched to presenting myself. 
Also I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially before a class of 40 pupils. 
Since they still have the school uniform I put myself on an old skirt of the mother of my family hostess and also a smock, blue socks and black shoes of skin. 
So, this way dressed I put myself to the pulpit and tried to pronouncing everything in correct way: " Sayonara Wo she Sylvana ... " - my name is Sylvana, I am of Germany and in one week it will be my birthday. 
In this moment I was very happy because already for two years he had started studying this language. 
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and done signs and all the time I have listened to the word "kawaii" 
Already he her knew about my Sleeves. 
That belongs to the vocabulary of survival of Japanese girls and means " pretty, adjoins " 
Later I slid rapidly on my place. 
The girl nearby had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the girl of exchange had to sit down next to her. 
The rest of the class was quite calm, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted. 
They all were speaking simultaneously, many questions were laughing and doing - at the same time it turns out to be very difficult to understand English of Japanese. 
Later in the playtime they all extracted his Bentos. 
The mother of my family hostess also did a Lanchbox for me - something is other that boring German pieces of bread. 
It had rice with grasses, small sausages, salad of cucumber and seaweed, fruit and something as meat in mass of tofu. 
In majority of the cases I have not even idea of what as here in Japan. 
The things are rare and they have a new flavor. 
What is sure is that everything is very rich. 
So, perhaps with exception of plums marinated in go out, bufff! 
In the Japanese schools the bentos are not simply a lunch. 
Sometimes it spends that a girl prepares a bento done in very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in hope to be able to know it better during a playtime. 
On that I read in my Manga-Comics. 
I have great curiosity to see if I can see it also here. 
" Why precisely Japan? ", my friends have asked me when I said to them that it wanted to go to Tokyo to assist one year the school. 
Then he was always answering: 
" Good, because it fascinates me. " 
Finally for years I prefer reading Sleeves. 
To be able to understand better the comics and the culture, one day I started studying a little of Japanese. 
For me it was absolutely sure that one day I am going to travel there. 
Also because I take a weak point as tradition and customs. 
Here they have a big value. 
Of a part the Japan is a country of the last technologies and of tendencies, of another part it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country. 
Since everything is organized well, I did not feel yet lost here although Tokyo is the biggest city that I have seen one day in my life. " 
Also the rats have feelings 
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger flees: why also is fear? 
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the ambience of the neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings. 
How is it possible to control if they, behaving in the way similar to us, feel the same? 
In an Internet magazine called "Edge" from many years the contributions of famous scientists are published. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the responses chosen to the question: what do you think what is true without being able to prove it? 
I believe that the animals have sensations and other states of conscience without I or someone other could prove it till now, although we cannot even prove that other persons have conscience. 
But in this case at least we can wait for it because quite the human brains present the same fundamental configuration. 
But as soon as we devote ourselves to other species and include the questions on the sensation and in general on the conscience, we enter the unknown ambience because the hardware does not coincide. 
When a rat is in the danger, it does the same as other animals: it becomes the dead person, flees or attacks. 
The persons behave in similar way, of what some scientists do conclusions on comparable subjective experience. 
Naturally I do not believe it. 
Two aspects of the cerebral structure are difficult to infect our subjective experience to that of the animals. 
First, almost always they include the circuits associated by the human conscience of the prefrontal side lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of his participation in the short memory and in the executive functions that direct conduct). 
This wide part is much more developed in case of persons that that of other primates and it seems that it is absent absolutely in other creatures. 
Bearing in mind at least the aspects referred to our conscience that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, between them knowledge on whom we are and the skill of gliding and deciding, there is a reason to suppose that even the man differs from other primates. 
Another peculiarity is in the linguistic nature of the man: As the majority of his experience is joined with the language, often that means that the conscience depends on her. 
In this case it is possible to exclude to the animals. 
But even if the conscience would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the conscience of the animals, created comoquiera, in many cases would differ from the majority of our states of conscience. 
That's why it turns out to be difficult to explain how the conscience of other animals works. 
If that, as anything interesting and subjective, does not even allow itself to measure because it has the special hardware, it is allowed to analyze by means of our experiences, like that his investigation presents to us big problems. 
The majority of my interventions refers to the content of the experience consents, but at the same time there is also another aspect of the conscience that would have to be easier for the investigations scientists. 
It might investigate the processes of conscience of the animals without bearing in mind his contents, and this is what it spends during the studies of short memory of primates, especially in the example of the visualization. 
But with this approach that Christof Koch was following and Francis Crick the essential thing happens rather to the neutral correlatos of the conscience than to the causal mechanisms: The two it can be similar or not. 
Curiously this approach emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of the visualization. 
And what results from that for the sensations? 
I have to to the fact that in the emotional system activates a part of the brain that is responsible for that, the same that happens with the fear. 
What we describe like fear is consequently a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the system of defense (or his consequences as for example the reactions of the body). 
Seen of this point of view the sensations are much fixed to part of the cerebral cortex what it distinguishes to primates and especially to the man. 
Of point of view of the linguistic nature they continue thin classifications of the sensation because we can differ and classify the states with help of the words and of the grammar to be able to describe the states of others at par of us ourselves. 
For example Antonio Damasco, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations stem from the simple activities of the parts of the responsible cerebral cortex for the corporal feelings and from the trunk of brain, the same Jaak Pankseep thinks, but brain concentrates more on the trunk. 
As this network has not changed very much during the human evolution, it is possible to recount absolutely to different types and his sensations. 
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it to be not probable. 
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly one feels that in two cases also like that: but how is it possible to control if rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same? 
Seeing the danger a cockroach he flees: so because it is afraid? 
I belong of opinion to that the resemblance of the behavior does not prove the resemblance of experience yet. 
That is true that the comparison neuronal helps: rats and men have similar trunks of brain, the cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least a brain. 
Is it the trunk of the brain the one that is responsible for sensations? 
Even if it is possible to prove it for the men: how is it possible to prove it in case of rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, possibly also the cockroaches (who knows it?), they have sensations. 
But I do not know how it can prove it. 
I prefer investigating emotional behavior of rats that emotional sensations because his sensations supposedly differ fundamentally from us (because the human conscience refers to special circuits and to the language). 
In any case here the progresses are waited in the ambience of neurology while the same measures itself of rats and of men. 
Since I do not investigate the language and the conscience of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know it if they exist. 
It is possible to say that I do not see beyond my nostril, but I prefer advancing that to work permanent without results. 
Well, I am emocionalista practically. 
The president of the UEFA Platini: term of grace for the Poland and the Ucraina 
Iwan Wasjunik, the substitute prime minister said that the preparations soon would realize under the direct responsibility of the president and of the prime minister. 
" The government looks at the decision of the UEFA in Bordeaux as the test of confidence of the capacity of the Ukraine to organize the championship of Europe together with the Poland ", said Wasjunik. 
" But this is not an amnesty for our country. 
Now the work is on the verge of beginning and in two countries there is much that to do. " 
The schedule of the construction and the reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the countries hosts is lame. 
Possibly the number of the stadiums is going to be reduced from eight to six. 
" We cannot lose any more time. 
Now we have to realize works with big speed ", said the president of an affiliation Ukraine Grigorij Surkis. 
" The UEFA is not going to remove the eyes of us. " 
In Poland a more radical step was agreed. 
After numerous scandals the Olympian Committee of Poland suspended the management of the Polish affiliation PZPN and replaced for independent manager Robert Zawlocki. 
The commission met by request of the minister of sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
It is " a serious danger that the PZPN is not capable of following the rules ", said Drzewiecki to the Polish news agency PAP. 
" In a letter we have made sure to the president of the UEFA Platini that the preparation to the championship of Europe of 2012 is not going to suffer from that. " 
Only in the last period many clubs of the first division were condemned because of manipulation in descent to the low category, finally also the council of division had to be deferred. 
Counterattack of indignant Dennis Quaid 
She wanted to promote a new movie, was speaking in an interview on the private life - and it has problems with his ex-husband: the star of Hollywood Meg Ryan designated his ex-husband as an adulterer. 
One angers and counter-attacks. 
The backward war of two roses in the ex-partner of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after his divorce two actors of Hollywood show publicly a disagreeable fight between them. 
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan it was pronounced for the first time on the reasons of the defeat of marriage: " Dennis was a lot of unfaithful time to me, and that was very painful. " 
She knew the alone size of his infidelity after divorce. 
The motive of the revelation of the private things was the work of Ryan with the press for his new movie " The Women " - there is counted a history of the defeat of a marriage. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to the designation of him as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is " unheard-of that Meg all the times counts the history of our relation in another version ", said the 54-year-old man to " New York Daily News ". 
Between other things it is very "lamentable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again " is going to remember in public the pain and the changes, everything what means a divorce for a child. " 
Whereas Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is again married and not long ago he is a twins' dad. 
And this way it finishes with his declarations emphasizing: " Be as it is my life continues. 
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is well. " 
The prices of the tickets of plane and of hotels are going down 
In the first half of the year 2008 the tickets of plane and the pernoctaciones in Europe were cheaper comparing those of last year. 
According to a current study, the tickets of plane in Germany became cheap even up to 50 per cent. 
The tickets of plane and the pernoctaciones in hotels became again cheap - this they are results of a study of the provider of the services of trip and of the financial services of American Express. 
The company has analyzed his information of reservation of the first half of the year 2008 and after the increase of the prices in the first trimester it found out a big change in the second semester. 
After for many years the prices on the market of hotels kept on increasing, the pernoctaciones in many places became cheap. 
Compared to last year, between January and March the prices in 41 of 48 cities different of Europe increased on average 6,9 for hundreds. 
From April until June the prices already lowered 3,6 per cent comparing last year. 
The tendencies were more perceptible in Paris and Rome, where the travelers had to pay less than the previous year. 
According to American Express, the reason of that was the course of flagging dollar, which was the cause of that " the interests of the American tourists to travel diminished. " 
The decrease of the prices of the hotels also makes to notice much more in the financial centers as Frankfurt or London that in the points of industrial concentration as Hann�ver, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Norwegian city the prices of hotels increased 26,3 per cent and this way they beat a record in Europe. 
In the first trimester the prices of tickets of plane also were showing the tendencies to the rise: 
Because of the increase of the prices of kerosine the travelers of the class Economy had to pay on average 7,1 per cent more that in the year 2007, the flights of long distance even became more expensive up to 29,2 per cent. 
From April until June the prices of the tickets of plane in the class Economy, compared to the previous trimester, lowered on average 12,5 per cent, but the changes of the prices for the Businessclass and the Firstclass were small. 
In Germany the change of the prices was more notable than in other European countries: 
From January until February the prices increased 11,9, in the second semester they lowered 23,6 per cent. 
According to a study, the prices for the national flights in Germany even reduced to the half. 
The cause of the change of the prices is of a part the slack increase of the economy, tells the company. 
In many parts of the market of the trips with the plane the demand is going down. 
Of another part there is big competition for the agreement of Open-Skies that liberalizes the traffic of planes between the EE.UU and the Europe. 
The sign of the tense situation is the annulment of flights of not lucrative distances in air companies, as well as a big number of air companies that in the first half of the year 2008 they went into bankruptcy - only in Europe were 24 air companies. 
The HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0 
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg it turns into the leader. 
Luhukay of Borussia does not salt yet him to doing the goal decimoprimero. 
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the necessary landing of the player of the national selection Marko Martin. 
The player of Gladbach started playing late and failed doing a goal. 
Everything what he wanted to say exactly reacting to the events, it was possible to read it clearly of his lips. 
Only it was known that it was right. 
" We need the second goal ", it was whistling Hermann Rieger in the entry of cabin of the stadium of Hamburg. 
I do not spend anything special in the catacombs, the time of rest finished and the majority of the presents was again in his places. 
Rieger was almost during three decades a physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys very big reputation as one of those that were forming a part of the group. 
That's why his request was noticed of a responsible person. 
Cornelius Jol the trainer assistant agreed with the head and raised the fingers as a token of assent. 
Cornelius is a brother of Martin Jol, the principal trainer of Hamburg. 
His order was the same: go, the second goal! 
But that was not realized. 
" Today not everything was agreeable of seeing ", added later Marcell Jansen. 
Also Bastian Reinhard had wanted to have it " more relaxed ". 
The result 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburg has to be grateful to Mladen Petric (11) with his impact of head; and also to the situation that the team of very weak Gladbach could not show all his force to the weak team of Hamburg. 
" This was a dirty victory ", said summing up Martin Jol. 
This Monday the SV of Hamburg is going to fulfill his 121 years. 
On Saturday of ser� the spectators had already celebrated his same ones, the blue sky on the stadium and the change of table on the screen of video. 
It is going to be a birthday without a real holiday. 
" We know to interpreting it ", said Marcell Jansen. 
He foresees that the partial qualifications of the table correspond more to the whim of the league than to the dominancia of his HSV. 
The quipo with his forced players is late as the Brazilian Neves and Miscellany, the scorer Petric as well as Jansen that Bayern was removed of FC need time to join, but the quipo cannot shine with his successes yet. 
" We need more of the feeling and of the dribbling ", demands Jol.

Dark matter influences the trajectory of the spatial probes 
For many years a phenomenon mysteries causes the uncertainty to the investigators: the Dark Matter influences the speed of the spatial probes during so-called gravitational assistance like that to the maneuver. 
The experts are afraid that the Theory of the Relativity of Albert Einstein could not be so correct. 
The probe spatial "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe. 
It threatens that the tubes of fuel are freezing now him a death in the cold. 
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, provokes the uncertainty between the investigators. 
The gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of the spatial probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example of the Earth. 
That allows the spatial probes to save fuel. 
Cassini-Huygens, the spatial probe European - American was using this physical trick as well as Ulysses did the probe of the Sun. 
But what surprise to the investigators for many years: The missiles do not behave for 100 per cent as well as it is waited according to the venerable law of the gravitation. 
Rather they frequent aberrations of the speed. 
Suddenly the probes it has major or minor speed. 
The physicists could not explain this effect till now. 
They called it the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver. 
A few experts are afraid that possibly even the general Theory of the Relativity of Albert Einstein who describes the force of attraction of the matter for the curvature of the space could not be so correct. 
Stephen Adler, the American physicist of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton believes solemnly now as before Einstein it did not confuse and tries to explaining the anomaly during the gravitational assistance with help of so-called Dark Matter like that, in what they were remaining the astronomers in the universe. 
" The reason of the anomaly can be the Dark Matter that also can be very nearby to the Earth ", he writes. 
The investigators of the universe know the existence of the Dark Matter only from ten years. 
Supposedly she possesses the force of attraction and his influence can be observed in others planets. 
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible what means that it does not send and reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially also no visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists the Dark Matter does at least the fifth one of the entire mass of the universe. 
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free 
As the Secretary of State of Italy confirmed, after ten days happened in the hands of kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be free. 
The kidnappers of the Sudan had demanded millions of the rescue. 
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the liberation. 
Five Germans are kidnapped in the south of Egypt. 
The negotiations with regard to the rescue began already. 
The Germans always fall down again in the point of attention of the kidnappers. 
The newspaper WELT ONLINE narrates on the most important cases. 
Evidently the European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are free. 
On that the same information presents the Egyptian state television, the boradcasting station of the Arab television Al-Arabija and the Italian mass media. 
After the news on the liberation in the Italian boradcasting station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian minister of foreign affairs, he confirmed the liberation: " Our fellow citizens and others hostages are liberated. 
' Now we control his state of health ", said Frattini. 
Five Germans, five Italians and a Rumanian as well as his eight Egyptian accompanists are well and are in the safety, he informs the Egyptian state television. 
19 participants of the expedition in the desert are in the way to Cairo. 
What incomprehensible sound stays the reasons of a shooting before the liberation of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian guard of safety the kidnappers were ready to finish with the sequestration, but the army of the Sudan suddenly had killed six kidnappers. 
" The problem was solved. 
They were in accordance with the rescue ", said the guard. 
It was a question of " of receiving only the hostages " when suddenly " this surprise " came. 
On Sunday the soldiers sudaneses have killed six kidnappers and have stopped two of them in the frontier zone between the Sudan, the Chad and the Egypt. 
The kidnappers have demanded of Germany the rescue in the amount for six million euros; the money had to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages. 
The newspaper " The Masri Jom ", referring to a German mediator, informed that the liberation was late because the kidnappers were afraid of his safety. 
According to the report the kidnappers have the intention of liberating the feminine hostages after having received the rescue. 
The men had to remain arrested until the kidnappers had a sure route to flee. 
The embassy of Germany in Cairo pushed back to take the position with regard to this report. 
Stepfather's abuse " led to the suicide " 
According to the court, years of abuse for his stepfather led a woman to killing to yes same. 
Michael Trerise, 57 years, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been a reprobate to five years of jail after it admitted eight charges of indecent assaults. 
The Real Court of Truro, across an investigatory study, knew that he regularly had tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old. 
Trerise wrote in a role of confession: " I feel responsible for his death. " 
The court knew that Mrs. randle committed suicide in his house of Mutley in Plymouth, April 1, 2007, to the age of 34 years. 
In the period in which the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise was accustoming to tie her and to bandage to him the eyes before carrying out his sexual acts, whereas his mother was employed at a pub. 
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall. 
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth. 
Nevertheless, the court knew that Mrs. randle, who used big part of his time working like voluntary for National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had inflicted him two times per week. 
In 2006, the district attorney Ramsey Quaife recounted to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about it, which after having been a big surfista and cyclist, now seemed " emotionally dead ", as if there was " resigned from the life. " 
In April, 2007 his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment of Plymouth. 
It is supposed that Mrs. Rande has killed to yes same suffocating by means of a plastic bag. 
Mr. randle faced the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a letter of confession that one concludes saying: " I usually tied her and ventarle the eyes. 
It was never a sexual assault. 
I feel responsible for his death. " 
The judge Christopher Elwen answered to Trerise: " You are a very strange fetishist, and for his victim it is necessary to have been a frightful experience, especially when it had only seven years. 
This disagreeable saga ends with the victim coming out its own life. 
Even more clear, it is that if she had not done it, probably the question would not have ended in the courts. " 
And he added: " I have noticed the effect that according to the description done by the father and Stephanie's mother the abuse was on his daughter throughout the years. 
Clearly she might have had a promising future, of success and happily. " 
An official loaded by the loss of information 
The BBC was informed that an official of the Office who forgot some secret documents in the train in June is going to be accused by virtue of the Law on the official secrets. 
The man, in trip of work for the Defense Department, left two documents highly classified under the train for Waterloo. 
The documents were spent to the BBC before being dedicated to the police. 
Surely it is a question of the least serious charge by virtue of the law and does not suppose any indication of the intention of committing an offense. 
The correspondent of the BBC for the Defender Frank Gardner recounted that the condemnation had come as a surprise for many in the English administration. 
" They were thinking that it was a question of an internal matter between the Defense Department and the Office, " he said. 
The employee, who cannot be named, is loaded under the section 8.1 of the Law, the clause that refers to the safe-conduct of the information. 
The Service Jur�co Real pointed out that the official must be accused for the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Committee of Secret Services. 
The forgotten documents were containing secret informations about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the safety forces in Iraq. 
The official was informed about the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his house to a secret place. 
The societies of construction face the price of B*B 
In Great Britain the societies of construction might face at a price of more than 80 thousand pounds sterling after the rescue / rescue of the bank Bradford and Bingley. 
The Government, in effect, provided 14 trillion of pounds sterling to protect the deposits of 2,6 million savers of the bank. 
The interest on the loan will be paid for all the companies that the savers use the money of, included 59 societies of construction. 
The general manager of the Association of the Societies of Construction (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers to be "humiliating" that the societies and his members should be necessary to pay 
Possibly, the loan de14 trillions should be reimbursed later that the mortgages of Bradford and Bingley are redeemed. 
Nevertheless, the interests that are earned in the �nterin, suppose loaded every year on 700 financial companies that have deposits. 
The Plan of Indemnification of the Financial Services the BBC confirmed to that 59 societies of construction turn out to be included in this number. 
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with prudence ... be named to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
That is to say that each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the societies of mediation had to pay approximately 18 % of the cost. 
The Treasure thinks that the interest on the loan will amount to 450 thousand pounds sterling in 2009. 
This endures that the societies will have to recover 81 thousand pounds sterling to face the first year of interest. 
Adrian Coles, general manager of the Trade association of the Societies of Construction, declared to the BBC that this situation is unjust. 
" It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with prudence in the growth of the real estate market are named to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent. " 
According to the BSA, there is no information that indicate the defeat of any society from 1945. 
" We will have the need to examine all the aspects of this matter in the next weeks to find out what options exist to protect the societies of construction and to his members opposite to what it might be an excellent price, " mister Cole added. 
The interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year up to that thing about in March. 
In 2010, it will be a question of a finished year of interests exigibles, that will be able to be almost twice more. 
Being the societies of construction mutual organizations and there being no shareholders, his members will end up by paying inevitably the price, be to turn major valuations or interests lower in his savings.

Denied the freedom on bail to the Ex-prime minister of Bangladesh 
A court of Bangladesh has pushed the request of freedom back on bail for the Ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, to the effect that she can be led to the jail when it will return to his country. 
His defenders said that the court did not grant to him the freedom on bail accusing of extortion of 50 million taka ($ 729.700) a businessman when he was a Prime minister. 
This is one of different accusations of corruption to his charge.

New investigation in the assumption of the lawyers estadunidenses 
The General Attorney of the United States has named a special attorney to investigate the dismissal of nine lawyers estadunidenses in 2006. 
The reason was a report in which the general inspector of the Department of Justice was criticizing the performance on the part of the officials of the administration. 
The report was criticizing the officials of the White House, the legislators and ex-Produrador General Alberto Gonzales. 
The investigation was motivated by the fear of that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons. 
The Special Attorney Nora Dannehy is investigating if the officials interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators in the attempt of hindering the justice. 
" Serious denunciations of possible criminal conducts have not been fully investigated or solved, " the Attorney General Glenn Bellas affirms in the report. 
One of the principal recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special attorney with the power to force the witnesses to leave his declarations. 
The discussion began when nine lawyers estadunidenses were removed of his charges by the Department of Justice in December, 2006. 
In that moment, the department motivated the decision suggesting that the lawyers had been dismissed by low yield. 
But later it was known that the lawyers had not been evaluated worse than different his companions, and many observers led to the conclusion that you them dismiss they would be motivated for political reasons. 
Some of the lawyers in question had been employed at the pursuit of a few Republicans, members of high profile of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate the denunciations of electoral fraud against the Democrats. 
These lawyers investigate and enjuician the judicial cases for the government 
and they can be dismissed in any moment, but not removed for political reasons. 
The successive chief of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure for the dismissals, resigned from his position. 
A certain number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same. 
The report of the General Attorney is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and he underlines as him that it had a " primary responsibility " for the dismissals, which it "abdicated" of his position of leadership and was " notably not colaborativo " in the process. 
Other officials, and between them Karl Rove, the ex-collaborator of Bush, were criticized for not having cooperated with the investigation. 
The epic of Meat Loaf of great honor 
The rock star Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell is going to be honored in Q Awards by his epic anthem. 
The singer, who will gather the special award next week in the ceremony that will take place in London, said that to obtain this recognition will be " an honor ". 
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, constituted the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977. 
The group of Coldplay are taking the candidacies for the awards of this year and are doing the classification of four categories. 
Paul Rees, editor - boss of the magazine Q, said: " There are some songs that come out time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is truly one of them. " 
The song written by Jim Steinman, needs a vocal excellent capacity as that it was used by Meat Loaf. 
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem. 
The song was known first as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and it became a number 15 in the classification. 
Nevertheless, Bat Out Of Hell de Meat Loaf remained approximately nine years in the classifications and went so far as to sell more than 40 million copies in the whole world. 
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered problems of health in the last years, including a surgical operation for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert. 
In 2007, a sharp laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts. 
Later it arose that it had a cyst in his vocal chord. 
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps prompt to the selling 
The city of New York is provided with thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other ways, famous, different some simply of service. 
Nevertheless, foundling hospitals the veteran cabdrivers and the local residents of long byline, it turns out to be difficult to indicate the place of the Extra Place to many persons, especially because many of them have never heard to speak about this street. 
Is the small street in East Village and spreads to the North of Primiera Calle? before encontr� Seconda Calle - between the Bowery and the Second Avenue. 
This callecita, more or less of 30 feet of breadth and 120 of length, is alike one more dusty alley one active route. 
There are no signs. 
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas. 
The street, nevertheless, has groupies. 
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that recently has constructed luxurious buildings in Primiera Calle 
that Extra Place wants to re-pave and to create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are hoped to open in the new buildings. 
Other groupies include the neighbors of old byline who commented to be loved by the rail truncated simply because it is one of the last remains of the past of the block earlier the appropriation of the buildings. 
Nevertheless, the Department of the Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has the control of the street, does not have any interest to possess it. 
In the meeting of the Committee of Community of Vencidad for the use of the ground that took place this month, the representatives of the agency Avalon outlined a proposal to buy the street. 
Nevertheless, the committee, preferring that the street was remaining to the city, he asked for a new plan that will appear next month, as there said Susan Stetzer, the manager of district of the Community n.3. 
" The city is proprietary today of very few spaces and we would like that it kept on possessing Extra Place, " Mrs. said 
" We can consider the proposals done by Avalon to solve the problem and to manage the space, but also we want to guarantee the public access to the street. " 
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that the small street wanted to repair and to install a few seats, included some to be used as coffee, in the waiting of renting the spaces. 
The idea that Avalon might buy the street arose for the first time during the meeting of this month 
but Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, not necessarily it wanted to possess it. 
" The primary worry of Avalon Bay is the renewal of this godforsaken alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area, " he said, adding that the proposal of selling was coming from the city itself. 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman of the Committee for the Preservation, confirmed that it was a desire of the city that thing about to sell the street and observed that the mission of the agency is the development of the property more than the management of that one. 
Compared to his surroundings more of color, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a trace in the history. 
Some of them believe that it obtained his name in 1802, when the big farm of property of Philip Minthorne was divided between his children and this narrow stripe of ground was not claimed by anybody. 
The rear door of the CBGB, the monument of punk rock that closed in 2006, abriba in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps a better acquaintance for the photography of the establishment who goes out in the covering of the album of Ramones " Rocket to Russia ". 
" The environment was magnificent, " there mentioned Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, that it extracted the photography in November, 1976. 
" It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, cartels, sheets, ropes. " 
Some residents, included the bloggers who write on the aburguesamiento of East Village, have been opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the public goods, still modest that are, must keep on being public. 
Others have praised Extra Place as rare piece, practically without changes, a slit of the city that should be tutelada. 
Jerem�as Moss, who directs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, " The Book of Lamentations: To Bitterly Nostalgic Look at to City in the Process of Going Extinct "), it has put at disposal part of a chat of the history of the city on Extra Place published by the newspaper The New Yorker in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: " Extra Place is an a little narrow alley and without exit, darkly also for the day and marked by doors of store of rusty iron and shutters, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the gutters. " 
With few exceptions, the street was looking like more or less the same one during a recent evening. 
A rat cur�a across the part behind of the street and was stopping close the door that was used to enter the CBGB and that now receives a shop of luxurious clothes. 
Graffiti in the walls and a bottle of beer empties closely 22-oz they were next to a new lot of disused newspapers. 
Some assistants said that rarely they put attention in Extra Place, but they suggested that it might give him a cleaned. 
Mr. Fields, for his{your} part, noticed that some persons he subestimates the attractive power of the street in his current state. 
" I spent the best years of my life, " he said, " in dark, humid places and disgusting. " 
The debate on the bilingualism: immersion in the English language 
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discusses the positions of the candidates on the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, an old man associated in studies on the California and the director of studies of Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a coauthor of the book " Not grasp Good expert You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice. " 
To call in an effective way the Hispanic voters is a difficult business. 
The proposals on the subject of education done by Barack Obama are the example of that. 
The campaign of Mr. Obama takes note that " the African Americans and the Latin students have significantly less probabilities of graduating that the white students, " and this is a very true consideration. 
To fight such differences in the events of learning, the plan of education of Obama specifically pleads, between other things, " the bilingual education of transition " for the pupils - English. 
Nevertheless, the question opened for Mr. Obama is if the commitment of the bilingual education, which prefers in classroom the instruction in languages different from English, is effective in annulling the distance in the final scores. 
Let's take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school officially recognized in the oriental region of the county of Los Angeles. 
In this school the immense majority of the students are Hispanic and of family with low revenue: 
more than one third of the students, many of which newly gone so far as, are learning the English language. 
Nevertheless, incredible 100 per cent of the students of the fourth year, have been evaluated positively in the examination of mathematics of 2008 
and almost equally amazing 93 per cent have dominated the test of English language and arts. 
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that the favorido for Mr. Obama. 
The school Sixth Street emphasizes the review and the practice, the constant evaluation of the competences and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses. 
Also, and here it are where Mr. Obama should take note, in accordance with Linda Mikels, the principal one of the Sixth Street, the approach of the school for the instruction of English to the students is in the " entire immersion ". 
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction. 
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to the bilingual education, said to me, " we have had extraordinary successes with students as the last one that has come from Mexico and that, if you enter the classroom 12 months later you would not be capable of gathering what was. " 
" It works, " it indicated, " we believe that it should work. " 
Will Mr. Obama take a school as Sixth Street Prep as a model of Hispanics - English answer for other schools with pupils' big populations? 
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the response, but the idea of the politicians of his party on the matter of the education (the Associations for the National Education have been in long time defenders of the bilingual education) and the same constant support to the bilingual dark education the prophecy of the response of Mr. Obama. 
Although it is that the immigrants must learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the question leaving that the people should allow worrying for the legislation that is written only in English 
and instead of that, he said, " you may make sure that his child can speak Spanish. " 
If really Mr. Obama wants to improve the system and to close lagoons, he should think carefully the models of education that work well, more than to despise them or to trivialize them. 
The oil price falls down sudden after the renewed economic fears 
The oil price diminished drastically this Monday because of the worry of which the American plan of rescue to the financial markets cannot be capable of reactivating the economy. 
The actions of the raw oil diminished of 7 per cent coming to 99,80 dollars the barrel in the negotiation of the morning in New York Mercantile Exchange. 
The price has gone down more than 20 dollars for barrel from the last Monday. 
In the last two weeks, the markets of basic products have been shaken by the financial crisis in Wall Street and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
After reaching a maximum for 145,29 dollars for barrel in July, the prices had fallen down to almost 90 dollars for barrel to beginning of this month, before suspense stepped back, once again, through the fault of enormously on the financial markets. 
The anxiety took possession of the investors, once again, on Monday, in spite of the leaders of the Congress who said they had come to an agreement during the weekend on the plan of rescue, the biggest in the history. 
The news turned out to be darkened by new worries of which the financial crisis would be far from ending. 
The evolution that took place in the last episode of the process of merger, confirms that Citigroup will buy the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said this Monday. 
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch governments and of Luxembourg they have partially nationalized the financial European conglomerate Fortis. 
The analysts in Cardinal Barclays said that, in the frantic weekend, the negotiations that they led to the agreement of rescue " they seem not to can to have reactivated the feeling of the market. " 
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is hoped in one that it should reduce of the demand of basic products, included the oil. 
" The perspectives for the world equity, the valuation of interest and of change are going to be more and more uncertain, " the analysts of Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to the investors. 
" We believe that the basic products will not be able to escape of this contagion. 
From the perspective of the products, ours worry more pressing is the evaluation if the American virus will spread on a global scale and specifically China. " 
The analysts of the bank have reduced his expectations for the next year, as the consumption of oil it goes down because of the crisis in the economic growth and the forecast of reduction of the oil price and of the gas is 20 per cent for 2009. 
The second quarter of madness: team establishes record 
After having spent, during the last eight periods, more time that nobody in the uniform of Jets, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis I thought that he had seen everything. 
Then he saw as the things develop in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a party without note into a game of going flat. 
" I have never seen anything as that, " Ellis commented. 
The second quarter initiated after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals they had played with indolence under the shaded ones of the clouds. 
In this moment it happened that the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles realizing a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect prediction for one evening, in which the evolution of relation between the players had a big jump forward. 
Favre found to Cabbages for two more goals in the quarter, one of these when a cornerback fell down and other came with 10 seconds in the half. 
" I did not go out of my way, " there said Favre of all the steps that were going to Cabbages. 
" He is a devil of a player. 
Our communication has been big, independently about what the people can think. " 
Meanwhile Favre and Cabbages were redeemed in the prey, the defender of the Cardinals was ill-treating the quarterback Kurt Warner. 
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned 32 yards for a touchdown. 
Safety Eric Smith punt� to another pass and it intercepted. 
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to the absence for Warner. 
In the last turnover, the absences forced by Bowens, might have been her better. 
The Cardenals had taken the possession with 10 available seconds, and later that the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked to him of 20 yards to gain the definitive one 34-0. 
They are the points major that the Jets never did in a quarter. 
About The trainer of the team, Eric Mangini, ask of describing the madness of this moment, he said: " The second quarter or the third quarter? " 
When both were answered him - the Jets allowed 21 points without response in the third quarter - Mangini said: " I can say that I liked much more the second quarter than the terzero. 
They have gained a heap of points in a very short period of time. " 
Rested Gebrselassie heads his world record 
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated because many people consider him to be the biggest broker of the history, overcoming his own world record in the marathon of East Berlin on Sunday and occurring the first person capable of covering the career of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes. 
After the victory in obliging career in plain in 2:03:59 AM, Gebrselassie has destroyed in 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26 AM, obtained last year in Berlin. 
To the age of 35 years, Gebrselassie has established the world record number 26 in a career of an impressive length so it has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the career against the clock even to the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part to the Olympian marathon in Beijing, being afraid - perhaps in a too alarming way, with hindsight - that the contamination of the air they were aggravating his problems with the asthma. 
On the other hand, it signed up to run in Berlin. 
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 grades, on having begun the career, 55 grades in the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using in average term a few butchers 4 minutes 43 second for mile. 
From when brokers of track as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat de Kenya have turned at long distances, the record of the marathon has diminished in more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo gives Coast of Brazil it won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998. 
After the victory of last Sunday, Gebrselassie said to the journalists that he had suffered cramps in the calf two weeks earlier and that it had lost a week of training. 
It is clear that the suspension made him fresh, not oxidized. 
" I am very happy, " Gebrselassie said to the journalists. 
" Everything was perfect. 
I began again one week ago, and today I dyed some doubts, but in the end everything was well. " 
The athlete has been an object of some critiques - especially in Kenya, the African - oriental rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much his careers, in general, avoiding the meeting with many stars of the world marathon, being based on the pacemaker as if it was a question of a track of career, and putting record ahead of the sense of competition. 
But this critique does not diminish the nobility of the skills of Gebrselassie as broker. 
This Sunday, to the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the half of the career in 1:02:04. 
Two brokers of elite of Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to defy to Gebrselassie later that his pacemaker diminished. 
But shortly before three miles of the goal, Gebrselassie took a last impulse to separate of Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36 AM, improving his best personal record in almost five minutes. 
Kamathi came to the third place in 2:07:48 AM. 
In the feminine career, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazajst�n but now civil German, completed a notable year winning in 2:19:19, the most rapid seventh time in the history. 
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain possesses the world record of 2:15:25. 
Last spring, Mikitenko, of 36 years, was a surprise and it gained the Marathon of London in 2:24:14 AM. 
She did not also take part in the Games of Beijing by what it was described as an injury in the back, but it recovered to win in Berlin and to establish his best record personnel in almost five minutes in the third marathon that it covered. 
It did a career of intelligent calculation, allowing a quartet of Kenyan brokers and Ethiopians to do of head and, next, recovering after 18 � miles. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia gained the second square in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop de Kenya finished of third in 2:25:01 AM. 
In a separate city, the pride and the tests of the life of color 
Concealed by the expansion of the park to topic of the big one Bordering, to few kilometers of the brilliant, noisy and colossal city, a calm people is, where the pride and the complications of the African American experience remain very clear. 
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and place of the infancy of Zora Neale Hurston, is already not so simple as she described it in 1935: " the city of five lakes, three fields of croquet, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a jail. " 
Now it is a place of peregrination. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! It takes a break in Eatonville to pay homage to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Renaissance of Harlem. 
And, nevertheless, in many senses, the city that she described? doing also a tourist stage by means of his inclusion in the guidebook of Florida produced by the Project of Writers Federales of the period of the depression - it keeps on being a separate place. 
Does the city remain independent, deigns and private road as it it was in the years? 30, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that the rural blacks in the Florida often resistiva to sharing his real ideas with the white man, who " knows so little about us and who does not know what is getting lost. " 
Even now, in the year in which a presidential black candidate, the senator Barack Obama, has attracted attention to begin a dialogue on the matter of the race, many keep on being cautious opposite to the stranger. 
" We are very cautious about the way in which our history is counted, " Jones Hortense said, 59 years, a resident of the whole life and member of the most ancient church of the city. 
" It has to be correct. " 
Eatonville for ages has been defined a paradox of victory and struggle. 
It is to the same tempo a historical model of the affirmation of the blacks and a community of almost 2.400 persons who live under a level of double poverty of the national average. 
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black south - sometimes disdained, others praised - that was born of the slavery in America. 
It is not of missing, if those who reside here are simultaneously proud and private rooms. 
To And the worry for the image of Eatonville really began for Zora, as here nobody it calls him a Mrs. Hurston. 
She introduced his hometown to the world across his deep books in dialect as " Mules and Men " (1935) and " Their Eyes Were Watching God " (1937). 
Five paragraphs into the handlebar of the Florida transformed the city, scarcely out of the Route 17, a highway that covers across the center of the Florida often forgotten inwards the history of the blacks and the human drama. 
Having face of cement so much in the life in the literature, Mrs. Hurston took his readership to the shop of property of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and later I penetrate more private areas. 
" Out of the highway to left hand, " he wrote, " there is the modern public school mar�n with his finished targets, his good supported jardinos and courts of game, taken care by Howard Miller, as him he can read scarcely and write. " 
She also mentions the new husband of the widow Dash and she is written that Glenn Lee " sells drinks of all kinds and anyone sews it goes away with transitory rooms. " 
Therefore, in only a few hundreds of words, Mrs. Hurston puts in relation Eatonville with the self-government, but also with the illiteracy, the second marriage and the sex. 
Clearly, this Fodor was not doing it. 
In fact, not the whole world appreciated the portrait. 
" Zora described it such a which was, " Ella Dinkins said, 90 years, one of the girls Johnson that Mrs. Hurston immortalized quoting men who were singing songs without color brings his beauty over. 
He added: " Some persons they did not like that. " 
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who returned often after his family changed Jacksonville, in Florida. 
Franklin Augusto, 77 years, reminds to himself that when Mrs. Hurston was coming in city, it was doing it without notice previous in a big Chevrolet, smoking and taking trousers in a city that today is still proud of dressing with dignity. 
The majority of the residents were remaining fascinated, said mister Franklin, while many people were laughing sarcastically. 
" The people much were always glad to see Zora, " he is still Mr. Franklin. 
But, he adds, moving to and fro in his chair in a rear court with sight on the Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, " she never remained too much time. " 
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, it was poor and his books were already not in printing. 
As the majority of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her. 
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color in Barnard College in the years? 20, was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where it had been living. 
In Eatonville, there were neither big commemorative ceremonies, nor big public readings. 
" I do not believe that his contribution to the world or his heredity they were understood, " there said Valerie Boyd, authoress of " Wrapped in Rainbows ", a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003. 
Did a certain turn come in? 80. 
The officials of the County of Orange wanted to put a highway of five rails across the city to substitute Kennedy Boulevard, the principal street of two rails of the labor community. 
The expansion of Orlando's area had already pushed the Interstate one 4 across the western rim of the city. 
The proposal came in a moment in which Eatonville was recovering of a difficult period of his history. 
The forced integration, between other things, had put term to him relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In? 50, the struggle for the racial miscellany took the hate it brings the community over. 
" During this period, a group of white boys, were going away for the city throwing oranges and every thing against the persons who were seated nearby, " mister Franklin said. 
" They killed also a girl, once. 
They threw him against a watermelon of the car. " 
In a letter of 1955 to Mrs. Hurston he wrote to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration for the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education " was insulting instead of honoring to my race. " 
R The residents say today that the desegregaci�n of the schools, positive in some aspects, had debilitated the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of his young people. 
" Were the black children used to be embraced - I remember this? one was accustoming to embrace the teacher in the morning and in the night, " N.Y said. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, an organization without ends of lucre. 
This lasted, added, until the teachers and the students did not come from the same place. 
" It was not embracing your teacher because �ra target - there is a cultural breach there, " Mrs. Nathiri said. 
Did the civil rights, nevertheless, help to create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons? black writers, actors and artists who happened over the prejudices, as she did, with buoyant, his confidence and lines as: " How someone can deny to yes same the pleasure of my company! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went away up to the anonymous grave of Mrs. Hurston and began to fight to resuscitate his reputation. 
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston done by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroduci�ndola in the American c�nones. 
The project of the highway came just at the moment when the most famous daughter of Eatonville was going again under the searchlights. 
And this time, the old man neighbors of Mrs. Hurston they saw her as a savior. 
In 1988, the community began to plan a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county might ruin with this highway. 
Thousands of groupies came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration. 
After several years, the county has left his proposal of highway. 
" The resuscitated idea of the highway to five routes, would have been to put in what you would call speed of curvature, a real civic pride, " Mrs. Nathiri said. 
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply: " Zora saved Eatonville. " 
The victory on the project of the highway has helped to change the image of the same city. 
You present yourself of out city as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to the church of here in 1993, they started appearing in big numbers, and the residents began to check the past. 
Eatonville entered the Historical National Record in 1998. 
A new library (taking the name of Hurston, of course) opened his doors in 2006, on a re-paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard. 
Nowadays, Eatonville keeps on being an anomaly in Florida: to only six miles of Orlando's center, he can, sometimes, feel like in a street of the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the year 1880. 
(90 per cent of the persons are black today.) 
The strangers who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of his meaning, often are still treated by precaution. 
To A permission for early it is necessary to do the majority of the interviews, and some things - as the murals in the most ancient church of Eatonville, painted by a white man and proving to be black men who are employed at the field - they cannot be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, brave and convinced teacher who takes weakness as the red brilliant one, he is still afraid that his community island gives be able to be misinterpreted. 
And, nevertheless, since the Hurston festival has been extended, also a major level of native pride has arisen. 
The young people, in particular, tends to see Eatonville to the same way as Mrs. Hurston he saw all his race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and equally to other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hard-working, dumb and mixed. 
It is a sincere civic sense to what it is possible to listen in the voice of the nephew of Mr. Franklin, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planned to turn to Eatonville after the university to be employed at the local government or for the Department of Police officer, who said he might need something from help. 
And even those that are younger, like Lark and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
" The majority of the persons, in case that they dare to go so far, will have to think, ' Oh, this city is not at all compared to any other one ', " he says Lark Kenon after going to the church in a recent Sunday. 
" But if really you stop and take a moment to look at his history, it is a very agreeable city. " 
Somewhere here, in New York, they all speak corrientemente about finance 
In the surface, nothing has changed. 
If the tourists in Manhattan were supported far from the kiosks and the gigantic screens of television in Times Square, they would not realize of being in the eye of the hurricane. 
They might never imagine that behind the glass frontage of the offices to nest of bee who are over his heads, the bankers and the agents of speculative funds who monopolize New York face every day with the worst " bad day of the office " from the bassoon of 1929. 
Boys for the home delivery keep on making resound his metal carts for the tea across the sidewalks and taking salvers of muffins for meetings I have breakfast. 
Latin men it keeps on dragging between buildings of apartments cargodos, as human mules, with 50 shirts of eccentric printing colgandas to a yoke across his shoulders. The office workpeople still wait in tail for his meal to go of the morning, and it keeps on being impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 o'clock in the evening in the weekdays. 
The employees wait still queuing for his bagel to the carts of the sellers, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five o'clock in the afternoon in the days of the week. 
It was looking like to me as if there was not a crisis by no means, until, this Thursday evening, with all the pessimistic forecasts that exist, I have decided to open a new savings account. 
Although he had calculated the necessary time so that the operation was coinciding with the calmness of the end of the evening with my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a tail of more or less 20 persons was already waiting. 
And not ahead of the window of the employee, to withdraw his cash or to do a deposit, but facing the bank of services to the client, where the clients of the whole life arrange his checkbooks of checks, the tourists look for instructions to go to the department stores of Macy and new clients want to open his accounts. 
The majority of these persons preceded me, I was informed later by Starr, my " personal banker of confidence ", and they were in tail for the same reason as I. 
In contrast to me, still, they had already withdrawn his savings of the smallest banks in places from where they had exchanged them, places as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Island of Staten. 
They had extracted his money of the so-called affiliations like that of saving (a little as a society of construction), of the credit unions and of the savings banks of his hometown which brancas only work inside the state of belonging, and that say to treat the clients as to his family. 
During last, year 15 of of these banks silently they have failed. 
In the last days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $ 327 billions of assets, entered failure, and since the New Yorkers were directing for themselves to his houses on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with a few deposits of saving of $ 440 billions, he was looking for a buyer of rescue. 
The workpeople of the offices and shops who were remaining in front of me, being afraid of another collapse, were moving his money to a bank to what it is considered to be a sure refuge, which is doing the majority of the rescues in Wall Street. 
Ordinary persons of New York have turned into last weeks into experts of the finance. 
A woman in my Chinese local supermarket, speaking by phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the unsuccessful bank, and his executive director of upset aspect, Dick Fuld, was commenting on the matter with familiarity as if they should complain about the stagnation of a companion. 
And Lyn, fiftieth and a little caretaker in uniform of my block of apartments, has changed the normal course of our conversations on Brad and Angelina or my buys to the shopkeeper. 
He said to me, after my visit to the bank, that " now I have all my savings in funds of the monetary market. 
The commutation is done, I am not taking any risk. " 
Moslem profaned graves at the moment when Austria approaches the right hand 
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the left wing of the party of extreme right hand for the freedom of the Austria and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated to the party of extreme right hand Vlaams Belang, takes part in a declaration to present the organization " Cities against the islamizaci�n " in Antwerp, on Thursday, the 17th of January 2008.

The delinquents sprayed Jewish symbols, like David's Star on some of the graves, but the investigators think that this can have happened for the attempt of concealing the real motives of the extremists impelled by the hate against the Moslem immigrants.

A spokesman of the Islamic local Community said that they were " deeply shocked " for the news of the profanaci�n, which came to the religious Muslims when the month Ramadan was finished. 
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for itself to a round of introspection later the draft to the right hand in the parliamentary elections of yesterday.

Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Party of the Freedom who gained more than 18 per cent of the voting, did his campaign against the handkerchiefs of head and the burkas, and also, expressed his opposition to the considered food related to the Islam. 
In his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke about a " European brotherhood " to prepare the emergence of the Islam. 
Both parties ententan to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing of that they were symbols of the politics of current islamizaci�n in Austria and Europe. 
Polls and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right hand as the strongest political block of the country, indicate that the change took place principally for the young voters who worry about his future in the European Union.

" I receive the teacher out of scene to extract his character " G�nther Bauer_Fot�grafo 
Neither heels nor frills nor suits of premiere. 
The essence of the big teachers of the flamenco, deprived of the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or the woman. 
Aside the artist. 
To other, the person. 
Inseparable except in the intimacy, in these moments foreign to the public, when to find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, unconcerned because they are not going to go out to scene. 
The German G�nther Bauer alternates in " Flamenco - people " the teatralidad of some stagings with singers, ballet dancers and guitarists with this side less known about these teachers. 
With this proposal, the photographer gathers the particular iconography of the flamenco from different ambiences. 
Included in the programming of the Month of the Flemish Photography, the exhibition " it reflects the international importance of the flamenco, major every day ", tells the creator, who clarifies that " Flamenco - people " " can be the any people but, on having seen the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the artists' typical images in the stage. 
These people re-treated " in the street " they are artists capable of transmitting in scene passion, sadness, happiness ... captivating the public. 
To receive the personality of these artists it is not necessary to extract photos of the stage. 
They take his personality and character inside. 
What I was interested in was to create an intimate ambience that I was affording to receive with the camera the personality of the big ones of the flamenco ". 
With the flavor of the festival " Singing of the Mines ", Bauer began in 1.997 a long trip to re-treat the cantaores, guitarists or dancers with a camera of badge. 
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and of the material they remember the classic photography. 
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classic base of the image, awarding modernity, idea that reflects how the flamenco understands the proper Bauer: " A music with very traditional roots, which it evolves and surprises every day ". 
It is not the action of the dance, of the singing or of the touch in yes, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captivates with his art the public. 
The search of a meeting with the essential thing, with the poltergeist that becomes visible in a way of feeling, of being and of being be and have been the constant of this work that appears these days in the gallery The Fot�mata. 
Well-known figures of the flamenco as Diego The Norway lobster, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique you Reside, The Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, between others, they form this selection of almost seventy photographed artists. 
The project has turned into an anthology of the flamenco, which soon will be published in a book that will gather the portraits exhibited in the sample. 
The passion for the portraits of Bauer led him to repeating the idea two years ago with " Portraits of veteran sportsmen " (" SportARTproject "). 
Although the concepts are different in " Flamenco - people ", the photographer admits that " I love re-treating the people, knowing them and being able to bring in a moment in his life, be a long or short moment. 
I believe that inside the photography the portrait is the most difficult genre. 
You find or face persons, personages, that sometimes you do not even know, or that leave to you only a few minutes to be able to take the photo. 
In spite of these circumstances, as photographer, always tried to make a reality my ideas ". 
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco who goes for title " Flamenco - people " shows itself in the Gallery The Fot�mata, placed in the number 20 of the street of the Bush, parallel to the Avenue of H�rcules, where he will be able to visit until the next October 16.

Llamazares urges to the Andalusian federation of IU to assume his competences in the case Miscellany 
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, made sure today that it will be the regional federation of the formation the one that will have to take a decision about the case of the ex-councilman of Youth and Sports of the Town hall of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after it was accused of realizing dealings of favor to relatives.

' Blood of May ', the epic bet of Garci 
It being inspired in the National Episodes of Benito P�rez Gald�s, Jos� Luis Garci recreates the famous raising of the Spanish against the Frenchmen in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious movie in his movies with next to 15 million euros of budget. 
Thus the film maker has tried " to illustrate the personages' stream and the social analysis " that it has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Guti�rrez and Paula Echevarr�a at the head of an interpreters' wide cast. 
Blood of May, with a length superior to half after two, is released this Friday in the cinematographic rooms, to turn into the future into a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours of duration. 
Big groupie of the literature of Gald�s, Jos� Luis Garci assures to have expired with this shooting " a sleep of infancy ", for which he must be grateful to Hope Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid entrusted him three years ago to roll a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2 of Madrid, something that he accepted any time the history was based on the National Episodes. 
15 millions of budget that has contributed in his totality the Community of Madrid constitute for Garci the " only opportunity " of ambientar with the sets and the adapted wardrobe the portrait of " a giddy Spain that one mistook of chief for whom to fight, since, the struggle for the independence took the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII ", it has pointed. 
But the film maker regrets not having been provided with a financing as that of Alatriste or The bogeys of Goya - more of the double of that of Blood of May-, from what it could not have rolled any scenes taken shape of a script signed along with Horacio Valc�rcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career. 
For it, of beginning again, the director has affected in that it is his habitual form of work, the staging with the actors, with whom it usually tests before initiating the shooting and to whom it does not do casting, for seeming to him "humiliating" and to think that " part of the office of the director resides in coming to the theater and to the cinema to know what happens in the industry at which it is employed ". 
Many of the interpreters with whom it coincides with Blood of May repeat before his camera, since it is the case of Miguel Rell�n, of Carlos Larra�aga or of Fernando Guill�n Cuervo. 
Candidate for the Oscar in four occasions - of which it won-, Garci thinks that any of three candidates, to representing to Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the proper Blood of May, Seven tables of French billiards and the finally chosen one, The blind sunflowers, they do not represent a young generation of the Spanish cinema, " that is the one that must be announced ", he has made sure. 
With this movie Garci does not wait for awards. 
" In the beginnings you believe that you work for the posterity, then you realize that only you work for the prosperity, and now you are content to do one more movie ", tells Garci after more than 30 years of professional trajectory.

" I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed to me this personage and seemed to me incredible ". 
According to the bailaora, " we do not try to count his life but to gather his spirit. 
The qualifications of his dances have suggested me sticks of the flamenco. 
This way, " the dance of the butterfly " a guajira suggested me, or " the dance of the snake " a few tangos. 
His dance was sensual and they have said to me that my dance also is inside these aesthetics ", he affirms. 
The assembly is provided with two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one in his spectacles, as it did in that of " The open door "; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally has wanted to collaborate with the one who was his pupil. 
" Matilde does of Turtledove of major, the personage of the ripeness.

In the work there is counted also of some form the life of this woman who developed in so distant places, especially for the epoch, as the India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to for the whole Europe, since it was residing habitually in London. 
" I have wanted to remember her because I think that it belongs to these women who have an enormous influence in a certain epoch and now nobody knows and much less puts in value his work ", affirms Bay�n. 
The spectacle Lope de Vega will give beginning today at 20:30 in the theater. 
The publication of the " Newspaper of a poet newlywed " closes also the Triennium 
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the " Newspaper of a Poet Reciencasado " in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), place where Juan Ram�n Jim�nez married Zenobia in March, 1916, is framed inside the activities programmed by the Commission of Culture of the Meeting of Andalusia to celebrate the " Triennium Zenobia and Juan Ram�n " (2006-2008), organized in order to fifty to commemorate anniversary of the authorization of the Nobel Prize of Literature and of the death of both.

America is pleased less without Paul Newman 
" Sometimes God creates perfect persons. 
Paul Newman was one of them ". 
The phrase belongs to the actress Sally Field, who was employed with him at " Absence of wickedness ", and it gives the idea of the neglect of the American cinema, and of the whole America, before the impactante it designs of that Newman has gone away. 
Sight that an Oscar found it hard him to them to give. 
And that was withdrawn from 2007. 
And that knew that it was very sick. 
Nevertheless it has been a mazazo for all. 
" Sometimes what one feels is beyond any expression, and I now have lost a big friend ", Robert Redford was crying, " my life and my country were better thanks to his existence ". 
Nobody was afraid of disgracing of exaggerating. 
There had died a father of the cinema and of the homeland in a particularly dark moment, with fear of the terrorists and of the markets, with the American autoesteem for the soils, looking desperately for motives for the dignity. 
So hard when it is the time and without virtue the men and well few beings that to admire you have left, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
It was personifying for all the ideal almost platonic one of beauty and really. 
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and gained causes, from the foundation to fight the drugs created in honor of his first-born dead person for overdose up to his mark of home-loving and organic meal. 
The whole gift to a country to which it has been difficult to him greatly to get over to a food suicidal culture. 
The expansive wave of the admiration was sweeping Hollywood without attending either on nationalities or passports. 
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, was stating that a man has not died but an age. 
Another Englishman, the oscarizado the director Sam Mendes, was saying that to work with Newman was not any more not less than the summit of his career. 
The bad boy come from Australia, Russell Crowe, was daring to be called Newman his biggest inspiration. 
" The very high strip of wood has left us to all ", George Clooney was stating, perhaps one of the few ones that nowadays dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the demand of righteousness high and of having a private life serious and removed from the cameras. 
This not always is easy or not even possibly in the jungle medi�tica of today. 
But there is the one who tries it, and Paul Newman is his example. 
He got divorced once but then he was married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, to whom it was faithful when surely there were remaining him the opportunities to it not be. 
" But why am I going to eat hamburger out of house, if inside I have fillet? ", it was he himself who usually joked. 
In the sky he assists to him the pride of which with the ground his daughters coincide with his fans, a little not so commonly in America. 
" Of all the big role that he played, of none it was so proud as of that of devout husband, father lover, solicitous grandfather and dedicated philanthropist ", they say. 
The imperfect career of Olympian Madrid 
Yes, the sleep of many of us is that a few olympiads are celebrated in Madrid and, after the frustrated 2012, it is possible that it is 2016. 
But I wonder: are we prepared? 
If we follow the lead of the yesterday career: I say that not! 
They were calling the perfect career, and to my judgment it has been the worst career with much in which I have been. 
A height of nonsenses that, certainly, if they bore it in mind as evaluation and I would examine, would be a very clear failure. 
But let's go on parts and from the beginning. 
The nonsenses begin with the collection of the back one, which makes you have to go earlier. 
Which I like, but if they make you go already that they give everything (included the chip to avoid tails in the career). 
Since not. 
Here only they were making you go to gather the back one (the first nonsense, to go only for that) and (after the pertinent tail): surprise!, only there was height ' S ' for the T-shirt (the second nonsense, because I need a height the XLth) 
In what world do we live? 
or is it that for the crisis they have decided to buy only small T-shirts with less cloths and more sales? 
Well, things how are you are a trifle compared with those of the day of the career. 
Apart from the fact that to have to go very promptly to gather the chip, the tail, on having come, is 15 minutes and, also, it is necessary to leave the rucksack. 
More than 35 minutes the waiting lasted, something incomprehensible for a career where more than 11.000 persons are waited. 
Then, like it was of waiting, it began the career and we had not left the rucksack yet, although once obtained, the collection was worse. 
Also, the rain ameniz� the waiting of more than 40 minutes, which together with attempts of popular rebellion and assault to the hut. 
I believe that approximately 500 persons surely tomorrow we will have pneumonia, and someone as I, they will not even appear with the correct time in the classification, due to the chip that they gave me that, I imagine, the exit did not mark me correctly. 
Certainly, if they were asking me for the perfect career, this one would not enter my thoughts. 
So I believe that we will keep on dreaming of an Olympian prepared well city. 
Microsoft looks for (virtual) receptionist 
In the conference of Emergent Technologies of the MIT Microsoft it has showed an advance of a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a species of Artificial Intelligence without a lot of intelligence but capably of realizing some basic tasks, as of asking for a taxi (or in case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move for the campus of the company) attending to what he listens in the conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many persons are in the room, those who are - even to remember what they wear - and listen and understand the key words of his conversations. 
Also to group to the presents according to the groups of conversation. 
In the video of sample the receptionist detects a third person but it understands that it does not belong to the group that is speaking with her and that is not an employee of the company. 
He asks him if it is there to visit someone and says to him that he will attend to him shortly. 
Quite without pantallazo blue. 
Impressive. 
But this, skylight, is the future. 
Now the company has better things on which Windows to concentrate, for example on the next version of his operating system. 
This week has spoken to itself much over a change of strategy in Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will not have so many associate programs. 
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers were coming with the essential thing instead of loaded of basurilla TV/radio commercial, would go five times more rapid - man, Steve, will be already for less. 
The whole find bearing in mind that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extra" to Windows. 
One is grateful for the change of course. 
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also the software. 
When Google Chrome went out to the network, I was one of those that one added to the theory of which it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows. 
Many pointed out with wise move that a navigator is not an operating system. 
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer so that the Hardware and the Software understand each other. 
It fulfills the same function as his wife or his husband when you have to say his something to his mother-in-law. 
It is true. 
It will never disappear but it is necessary to think about the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute, but relative truth. 
What Ballmer has said this week is the assertion of this idea. 
The people every time ready less attention to the operating system, and more to the web navigator. 
The computer is started only to execute the Firefox or the Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time sailing than in the environment of windows. 
Why do they serve the half of the applications that come in the system? 
Less it is more. 
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, that It Dresses. 
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex. 
It is interesting to Microsoft more to integrate his services online and that finally are an alternative to Google. 
They need it desperately, in fact, and I bring a small example. 
I took the photo of this post in one of the rooms of rest for employees of Microsoft, in Redmond, at the beginning of month. 
In the machine of refreshments a cartel asks them to use his tool of search - " for Your search. Our future ". 
In the year 2006, an independent study was concluding that 66 % of the employees of Microsoft was using Google to look in the network. 
Last week, certainly, a delay was confirmed also in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not come at the beginning of 2009 but to ends, rather pulling 2010. 
In Microsoft surely they will look for the joint throwing of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The phone, after everything, is every day more computer. 
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already in the street, is going to spend invoice. 
Him Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso was taking her in the C�te d'Azur, Leonardo say that Caprio was showing one in ' Blood diamond ' of Edward Zwick, the same as Al Pacino in ' The Godfather ' of Francis Ford Coppola and gay is a part of the uniform of the parish musculada. 
And if we start enumerating stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of strong that one of sharp-pointed moustache that was raising weight in an ambulant circus. 
In essence, it is only the typical masculine T-shirt of interior in cotton, surrounded and without sleeves. 
The 'tank', which the speaking anglos call, but him Fabuleux Marcel of Bruxelles sprouts on all other. 
First, for his resounding name - although familiarly it is known as ' Marcel ' - who has to see with the sport because it receives his name, as lover of singer Edith Piaf counts the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan. 
' Marcel ' emphasizes on the others for his excellent cotton, for his court unisex, for his distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (scarcely recognizable) that the most emblematic models of T-shirt go as detail in the neck. 
And attention, because the production of the Belgian signature not only centres on his tank tops. 
Also it includes sweatshirts college, boxers retro, cardigans of cashmere, cotton trousers, seaworthy T-shirts, babies, mini shorts... 
Pledges thought for the serviceability underwear. 
Although it is a sorrow to leave them as interior clothes. 
They have delight too much. 
" I want to be a young mom; the candidate does not worry me " 
His enormous seemed with his sister it has not prevented him from developing his own personality. 
M�nica Cruz is small but it fills of vitality. 
At present the sisters Cruz take very seriously his new activity in the fashion. 
For M�nica, really much more than a few nice and famous girls they give his name. 
It has been in Paris in the promotion that the signature Handle does in his new head office, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards of fashion that the Spanish house esponsoriza.

So much my sister as to I love us the cinema of the 50s and 60s; hence we extract many references. 
Then, I like much to get lost for a city and to observe the women as they are dressed, since they combine and mix his clothes, I make it great. 
Ballerina, actress and designer, you are a very versatile woman: not? 
I believe that yes but, in the end, everything joins and they have many bonds in common. 
I from small liked the clothes; it wanted to go to house of my grandmother to poke in the cupboards of my aunt and to see his clothes. 
It was the bomb, almost better that to go to the amusement park. 
Then, of ballerina, it was always trying to take care how I was dressing myself. 
You already know that the ballet dancers like much to make us our estilismos for the classes and essays, to look at the mirror and to feel good. 
And in the actress's role when they give you the wardrobe it is when you find really the personage. 
Then, everything is joined, of course, with very much respect towards the designers and professionalism. 
You have fulfilled not long ago the 30: has crisis brought in you? 
What goes. 
I feel better that never, I like the 30. 
I think that the woman is done, it has experience and savours the life with less errors. 
, I do not scare the biological clock. 
I have done the things that I wanted from small and this has given me a lot of internal happiness. 
Then: do you think of being a mother or not? 
Certainly, I know that I am going to be a mother because me the body asks for it and, also, I want to be a young mom; this I do not want to get lost it. 
As for the candidate, it does not worry me. 
What I will do is to give a lot of happiness to my son and to educate with great love love. 
As for the cinema, you are dependent on several premieres that you rolled last year. 
This way it is and I want already of that they see the light. 
I, that I am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and anxious, I want everything for already and skylight, it cannot be. 
I want of that they are released ' Last hour ' and ' In search of Christ's grave '. 
To seeing that they seem to you... 
A few days ago you made debut on a footbridge with Naomi Campbell: not? 
Good, good, do not say that. 
It is not that it was raising me to a footbridge to do of model. 
Simply, my name is Naomi Campbell, whom I meet for time, to invite me to go to London to take part in a charitable parade for his organization ' Women for a better world ' and the clothes that we exhibit - I extracted two pieces of our collection for Handle - it was auctioned to collect money for this Naomi's ONG. 
The people do not know this tender heart of Naomi. 
So many things of her are said that, I that I know her, would say to you that many are not true. 
Also, I remain with this so good part in which she interferes. 
It asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he goes so far as me to ask to do the pine, since also. 
For benefiting the women of the third world, which it is necessary to have. 
The conductive backsliders for alcoholemia will have to install the 'alcolock' 
Interior wants that the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholemia, has to install in his vehicle a system that prevents from starting the intoxicated vehicle, or if it does not blow. 
The initiative promised to be already last June and now she turns out to be already included in the annual memory of the General Prosecutor's Office of the State, according to which there talks each other about a project pilot who will have a duration of one year. 
His purpose is the reintegration of the driver, from what this one also will receive a course of road reeducation. 
In the experience, in addition to the General Prosecutor's Office of Segurida Vial, they will inform the General Direction of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Technological Institute for the Security of the Automobile (FITSA). 
According to the statistics, between 30 % and 75 % of the motorists denounced more than once for driving intoxicated take the car again. 
The alcolock would avoid it since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the valuation of alcohol in exhaled air and prevents from starting the automobile if the driver does not blow abtes; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected it is superior to the authorized one. 
His cost is superior to 1.000 euros and raid due to the sanctioned one. 
In this sense, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 was demonstrating that the vehicles equipped with these devices reduce even in 65 % the infractions during the first year of implantation. 
And in Spain it is anticipated that it might save the life to 115 persons every year. 
The measurement adheres to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle these behaviors before they derive in penal crimes. 
And to facilitate his implementation, since the legal reform can do for ordinary route, and, nevertheless, the necessary reform for the penal route demands a reform in an organic law. 
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although already it has been implanted in an experimental way in any industrial vehicles and of public service. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of the Deputies will vote tomorrow for an initiative of the Spanish socialist party in the one that proposes to install in the school buses this system, just as it has been carried out in France. 
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes' 
With British punctuality, to the 17.40, the hour foreseen in the program, was landing in the presidential Hangar of the airport Benito Ju�rez of Mexico DF the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling. 
The sun was of retreat but his beams were still forcing to use the hand like visor to see the real partner descending from the plane. 
On foot of gangway, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities. 
Hours earlier he had asked for the street, to the cabdriver, if it was known that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip. 
- Ah, very good, of that time it will not be possible to go away to the airport to load at this hour... She is of here or this way... 
- Not, not gentleman, she is Spanish but it lived here through a pair of years. 
- Ah, very good... 
But the Mexican press yes knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and the importance of the trip. 
They are great those who wait in the hangar of the airport for clingings for the red carpet and to a military fence formed by 27 soldiers of marina who interpret the volley of honors. 
The Prince turns out to be smiling, garment of navy blue, and she, the Princess, long hair to the wind, very sober, does not use his habitual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had communicated to him that in the DF was threatening thunderstorm. 
They give a smile and a plain stop to the photographers before going on to the room in the one that waits for the official covey. 
In the door of the hotel at which they stay, one of four big ones of the city, a correspondent expects for them dicharachera from the Mexican television. 
The award best provided with the fashion 
Possibly there is no place in the world most adapted to present an award of fashion, which Paris and possibly there is no a more exquisite alive designer and bont live that Valentino. 
Handle has just presented the second edition of The Button - handle Fashion Awards, to promote the international projection of the new talents of the fashion. 
It is provided with an award for 300.000 euros. 
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the winning Belgian of the first edition, was looking at his designs in the shop window of Handle in the number 54 of the boulevard Haussmann of Paris and almost it was crying of the emotion. 
Certainly, that is the second biggest shop of the signature in Europe and has just be inaugurated by 1.335 square meters of surface. 
The first one is in London. 
So many events joined the desire to be grateful to the designer Valentino at that the jury of the contest was presiding, did that we were finishing in a luxurious dinner in the opera Garnier of Paris. 
With the closeness of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential table of gala prepared by Handle, was seeming even more spectacular. 
Nati, with the heart departed from sorrow and doing of intestines heart, for the recent death of his brother, put himself on a suit of the House and a few seasonings of ELAH, which were cutting the respiration, and of the arm of his son Luis - a cannon of almost two meters long - he accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner homage. 
Andik, proprietor and master of Handle, was doing the honors and he is so a gentleman who finished, along with the baron of Rotchil, without jacket, because both one had given them to two ladies. 
M�nica Cruz, who came to the shop with trousers and shirt - of proper design - and for the dinner black length transformed with a sexy garment, it got excited when in the night walk along the opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, they taught us the room of ballet essay and she, remembering other times, fought on one of the bars and did a threat of ' grand plie '. 
In�s Sastre did not remain to the walk along the dependencies on the palace, but earlier it taught us in the mobile phone photos of his son. 
On the following morning we could be glad the sight with the presence of Olivier Mart�nez - another cannon that moves in motorbike - and for John Travolta, who came to the intercontinental hotel of Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having asked previously, that there were no smells in his room. 
You cover with stars under the starred sky of Paris. 
Oh her, c'est the vie. 
1001, the number antistress 
There is no 1000 but 1000 any more ways of forgetting the chaotic and frantic daily life. 
And for if it was small, they all are assembled in a book that the relax will bring to the bookstores on September 30. 
The alarm clock almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it is still worse to imagine wrapped in the rough rhythm that imposes the current life. 
The office is called a tension and the computer backache. 
The stress is the evil of the XXIst century. 
But there are neither one nor two methods to fight the daily depletion and the problems of unplugging with the labor world. 
Not, the number climbs to, nothing more and neither more nor less, that 1001. 
To the margin of the positions of yoga, the classic massage or the treatments of 'spa', Susannah Marriott assembles on the pages of a book the whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one. 
The work antistress is called ' 1001 ways of relaxing ' and his calmness will come to the bookstores of the hand of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
If someone thinks that it is not possible to reach the calmness in ambiences as the work or across the personal relations, this 'manual' denies such a credence. 
Also, it offers other procedures how is life in contact with the nature or you prescribe 100 natural % who contribute to the relaxation. 
If the adrenaline does not run already for your veins to restore the balance of the body and the stress has turned into a problem, it is time to sit down in the couch, to disconnect the mind and to concentrate on the reading. 
To speak slept 
Some children speak in the night. 
I do not refer to these that wake up much espabilados telling us something that has happened the previous day, but to children who speak being asleep. 
The first time that happens perhaps you take yourselves a fright, but actually it has no importance. 
It is a benign alteration of the sleep that is called somniloquios. 
It is quite frequent, especially in children and adolescents. 
Insurance that they have told him to more of one that he spoke in the night. 
This phenomenon can appear in a very sporadic way (once in the life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or in a more periodic way (every day, once a week, once in months ...), on the following day the child does not remember anything. 
There does not exist the only cause that determines his appearance. 
Often they are related to other alterations of the sleep as they are usually the nightmares, the night terrors, the night enuresis (to do to him asleep pee) or the somnambulism, but it does not have porqu� to be like that. 
Since we have already mentioned previously also they can be associated with pictures of very high fever, with situations of stress or overexcitement. 
Anyhow it is a slightly studied phenomenon. 
The intensity with the one that appears also is very variable. 
It can be that he speaks in a calm tone of voice, free words, a murmur or everything opposite (screams, crying, long speeches ...). 
About the cases in which the declaration is very intense it would be convenient to observe the child and to consult with a specialist, to verify if there is some question that is generating great anxiety and giving to him gone out this way. 
We have said that it is a benign alteration, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another alteration of the sleep that yes could talk each other (for example, if it is associated to apnea from the sleep or to a picture of stress). 
What yes it is possible to do is to bear in mind a series of such very simple preventive measurements as: 
To try not to excite very much the child before going to sleep. 
Therefore to look for calm games and to avoid programs or series of television that are of fear or a little violent. 
With very nervous children and that is difficult to relax very much, skills of relaxation can be used to help them to acquire a certain internal calmness. 
This will favor that the child could feel calmer sleepy. 
Once the somniloquias appear try to support the calmness. 
Remember that they are inoffensive for the child and that on the following day he will not remember anything from what it has gone on. 
Useful advices 
Do not wake up it. 
It is useless, because he does not realize, and you will break the sleep. 
Although he is speaking, he is sleeping and therefore he is resting. 
Remember that if he proves to be much distressed during several episodes it would be convenient to consult or to find out what is what generates so many anxiety in the child. 
If it is understood what he says (that it is not the most habitual thing), do not fall down in the temptation of doing to him an examination to worm out information. 
You will not obtain anything, because, on having been asleep, it is not conscious like to organize his thought. 
Also you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, with very much elegant which in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions that you extract. 
Never say to the child that you can interrogate it in the night to know his secrets. 
Not even of prank. 
That generates great anxiety. 
In short, do not worry, it is not bad at all, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes. 
Illhaeusern finally! 
The club of football, Illhaeusern, found finally the way of the victory in his field after a long period of scarcity. 
Without having done a good party, the team created many occasions of goal and it was capable to do a goal to gain the party. 
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty to express themselves. 
After the first try of captain Kauffmann who was rubbing the square with a shot of far, Illhaeusern quasi was going to take the "power" and for shift Fonderflick of far, then with Hirn it arrives, Romain with the top of the foot or also Diebold was coming to prevent the defense of Dannemarie. 
Opposite, we did not allow to happen the midfielder and allowed only Riahi in position of attack. 
The beginning of the second half was crucial, the first with two occasions of goal of Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scoreboard for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, good placed to gather the ball pushed back in the first try of Diebold (53 '). 
But the scorer Illhousiens will not be able to savour a lot of time his happiness and it will be forced to turn in the wardrobes a dozen of minutes later and to make his team-mates like that in numerical inferiority. 
Pero Dannemarie will not make the most of the opportunity and it will not be a problem for eleven illhousiens that stepped back a little to "compress" his defense, except in the last seconds of game during which, after an important gabble, the ball happened much next to the transverse field. 
Sarkozy finds the furious fishermen 
Before detaching towards the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a detour for the Brittany. 
Opposite to the declaration of resistance on behalf of the fishermen who strongly disturbed last Monday the earnings of several Breton and Norman ports, the president of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finist�re, to find there his representatives. 
These promised to receive it " with a constructive spirit " and they hope that " it should come with concrete propositions ". 
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " committee of crisis " created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measurements opposite to the increase of the prices of the diesel oil, which marks a record on having reached 1,14 euros for liter. 
According to the spokesman of Elysian David Martinon, the president " it will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help his companies so that they are competitive again and to save the conditions of employments and of remuneration of the sailors ". 
The fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot firmly. 
On Tuesday morning, they took operations to reduce the circulation in the Morbihan and in the Calvados, that have caused cloggings like that of almost 10 km. 
The sports port of Quiberon has been blocked also, but the connections towards Belle-�le have not been stopped. 
" A barrier filtrante " has been put in the peninsula of Quiberon. 
The sailors already showed on Monday his determination being burning hot, on having infuriated the dawn, tires and wooden palettes in front of the deposits of fuels of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, whereas declarations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc. 
The movement propagated to other ports of the Atlantic coast and of the Spot, as in Them Sabers d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the trawlers remained in the port, or in Him Havre, where approximately twenty ships blocked the movements of the ships of commerce. 
The fishermen of The Turballe and of Croisic, in the region Loire - Atlantic Ocean, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Entire refinery of Donges. 
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to hope up to the meeting of this Wednesday that it will take place to the department to think about possible actions. 
In Guilvinec, the " committee of crisis " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and about his participation in the meeting foreseen in the Department of the Agriculture and of the Fishing in Paris. 
But any Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by persons in charge of the national committee of the fishing, which did not support his movement. 
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not retire " and " they do not want to move towards Paris ", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the president of the committee of the fishing of Lorient. 
The professional fishermen, who do not pay valuations on the diesel oil, pay at present next to 50 cents for liter but they think euro that it is possible to reach the financial breakeven of a ship only with a diesel oil with a price lower than 0,30 for liter.

It has good instincts ", Bill Clinton prepared nevertheless this weekend. 
The septuagenarian McCain put in evidence his indisputable experience on the subject of exterior politics, underlining the "ingenuousness" of his adversary on these questions that were in the heart of this first confrontation. 
" Does not the senator Obama seem to understand that? " it accused in several times. 
" I do not believe that the senator Obama has the experience and knowing necessarily to be a president ", also he made sure. 
These words have been repeated from yesterday in the televised republican publicities. 
Obama underlined that it was representing the future. 
Without being disconcerted, it proved to be concise and precise. 
It heightened his aptitude to take the good decisions, and of restoring the image of the United States in the world. 
" McCain there is no the yet understood one, whereas Obama, it is the already made one ", he answered, this weekend, a television democratic publicity that was reproaching the republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on the Americans ". 
" During ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had many things that to say on me, but not at all on you, Obama denounced, yesterday, in front of 20 000 persons who had met for an electoral meeting in North Carolina under a thick rain. 
It did not pronounce the words " middle class " or " workpeople ". " The financial defeat favors clearly Obama, who is considered to be by the Americans the personage most capable of saving the economy that is at the edge of the abyss. 
" Next week might be a decisive episode ", the influential and democratic senator Charles Schumer was estimating, yesterday. 
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an ancient mimbro of the administration Clinton, compared the " good economic instincts " of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
According to the democratic candidate, the disaster financiario current " is the final consequence of eight years of a bad economic politics put in execution for George Bush and supported by the senator McCain ". 
Reaffirming that everything would go so far as in spite of to reduce the taxes of 95 % of the Americans in spite of the scares of Wall Street, the senator of the Illinois also it pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of the renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a safety system and health. 
McCain wants to construct a park of 45 nuclear power plants up to 2030. 
Prudent, both candidates avoided the questions that were referring to the plan of financial rescue for 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday in the evening by the Congress and extremely unpopularly. 
" In Minsk: " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? " 
Young people and opponents were showing last Sunday evening in the principal square of the capital bielorrusa to push the results of the legislative ones back in advance. 
Some hundreds of Bielorrusos met on Sunday evening from the closing of the electoral centers in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the legislative ones. 
Whereas no result had been announced yet, numerous young people had come to show against the power of the president Alexandre Loukachenko: " the dictator, has to resign ". 
Some of them admit not to have voted: " why, since they will do what they want with my vote ", says a young man. 
They do not believe that the diet that it made good facing the foreign observers in order to renew the contact with the European Union is ready to carry a democratic change out. 
The sanctions, between which l'interdiction of visas for 40 leaders bielorrusos and the frostbite of certain assets, might be raised if these elections are considered to be like clean for the observers. 
They it were not according to the opposition. 
" We have been put next to the electoral commissions and our observers could not take part in the inventory of the votes ", there was sorry Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman of the Union of the democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties. 
" It is a cosmetic change, underlines Alexandre Milinkievitch, ancient candidate of the opposition to the presidential election of 2006 and leader of the movement pro European, because the important thing there is who counts the votes, and in our house, it is the executive power. 
If some deputies of the opposition enter the parliament, it is because they will not have been designated but not chosen. 
" But his entry to the parliament can mean appearances in television, meetings in the regions and proposals of law. " 
The opposition has to so of entering the political game because " it is necessary to begin the dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy, which has many debts opposite Russia, enters crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of doing to him a protectorate of Russia. 
But we want to be independent ". 
The opposition is afraid that the Organization for the safety and the cooperation in Europe that continued the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the voting. 
He underlines that the numbers of participation seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26 % of the electorate in Minsk) favored the manipulations. 
" Have you noticed the elections? He interrogates the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of last two political prisoners liberated in August of this year. 
There was nobody in the electoral centers. 
And there will be as maximum five deputies of the opposition to the parliament, which are convenient better to the power. " 
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October. 
In the television, the president Loukachenko and the members of the central electoral commission are congratulated on his success. 
The interview - Blood is an insurance again 
H�ma-Qu�bec was celebrating yesterday his 10 � anniversary of his foundation, and his president, Francine D�cary, was right of being glad, because H�ma-Qu�bec has been one of the surer and effective providers again of blood in the world. 
And especially, it reconquered the confidence of the public who seriously had been hesitated by the scandal of the blood contaminated in the year 1980 and 1990. 
Since it is known, the national reservations of blood administered by the Service of blood transfusion of the Canadian Red Cross have been contaminated by the Virus of Human Immunodeficiency (VIH) and the virus of the hepatitis C during the year 1980. 
Opposite to this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the government of Canada did in February, 1994 a public poll presided by the judge Horacio Krever, who was trying to clarify the circumstances that they had led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations so that such a disaster does not reproduce any more. 
Whereas the judge Krever was late in presenting his relation, certain provinces then created a committee that took as a target to plan a new system of management of the blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee G�lineau fulfilled this one mission. 
Consequently of the reports of G�lineau and Krever, two providers have been created in Canada: H�ma-Qu�bec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Society of blood to supply all other provinces and both territories. 
" In 1998, when H�ma-Qu�bec began his activities, almost 38 % of the people had still confidence in the blood system in Quebec, he remembers D�cary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
After having done a lot of efforts to improve the safety of the blood products and a lot of work during the years that continued, we have recovered the confidence of the public ", he says before affirming proudly that at the beginnig of 2008, next to 94 % of the population quebequesa had from now on confidence in H�ma-Qu�bec. 
Doctor D�cary remembers nevertheless in that " the confidence is something extremely fragile ". 
From his creation, on September 28, 1998, H�ma-Qu�bec applied the beginning of precaution. 
In that epoch, we were present in Europe at the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of the illness of the crazy cow, a new variant of the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, tells D�cary. 
And we did not know if this illness might be transmitted by the blood. 
Then we rest on one of the principal recommendations of the reports of Krever and G�lineau, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious illness can come from that, in this case the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that leads inevitably to the death, we restore measurements of exclusion. 
In April, 1999, since we deny the blood of the persons who had remained any more than one month in the United Kingdom from 1980. 
But, some years ago, it has been demonstrated out of everything doubts that this illness is transmitted by the blood. 
This episode showed us so the beginning of precaution that was applied had of the sense. " 
In 1999 there appeared on the market a much more sensitive skill of detection of the VIH: the tests of acid nucle�do that allow to detect directly in the blood of the donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the virus, on that the tests were based used till now. 
The tests of acid nucle�do allowed to shorten the period between the moment in which the person has been infected and the moment in which the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our skills, tells the specialist. 
We could reduce this period in a duration lower than one week. 
We diminish this way substantially the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we could not detect to them. 
These improvements allowed to lower considerably the risk of contracting been by a blood transfusion. 
Nowadays, a person every 12 millions runs the risk of receiving blood contaminated by the VIH. 
" He wants to say that that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected by the VIH. 
This way since H�ma-Qu�bec distributes every year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, more than 24 years will happen before there supervenes a case of transmission of the VIH for a blood product. 
I believe that it is possible nowadays to receive or to prescribe a blood transfusion to recover the health without worries ", affirms the chief of the direction of H�ma-Qu�bec. 
" Our challenge for next decade is to support the safety of our products. 
There is never known pathogenic which might emerge in the system. 
Last year appeared in the island of the Meeting the virus Chikungunya that, to example of the virus of the western Nile, is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant ", doctor D�cary chases before underlining that in addition to a sure supplying, H�ma-Qu�bec has to foresee also a sufficient supplying. 
" The needs increase because the population ages. 
Since the treatments anti carcinogenic more aggressive, the patients often need an injection of red globules or of thrombocytes. 
The aging of the population has also consequences on the network of the blood donors that 3 % of admissible Quebequeses regroups on average only to the blood donation. " 
All the persons with good health, of 18 years and that correspond to the criteria of admissibility can donate nevertheless blood every 56 days, or six times a year. 
On average, 14 % of the persons who proposes his blood they are not accepted, because they suffer of been or of malaria, for example, and if they travelled in a country where he reigns the malaria, they will be excluded during a period of one year. 
" With this one 3 %, we manage to support an inventory that covers the needs of the hospitals. 
The penuries are very rare. 
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donors' network as they age and cannot donate more his blood. 
But it is difficult to convince the persons to donate his blood, but especially to retain them and to incite them to be a regular donor. 
Since the current life is very wild, we find rarely the time to spend an hour to donate his blood ", Francine D�cary grieves. 
With a budget per year for 297 million dollars, H�ma-Qu�bec supplies not only blood products, but also human textiles, between which bony grafts, cardiac valves, ocular balloons and skin that is almost exclusively used for big burned. 
These textiles are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Qu�bec, which manages also the only public bank of blood of the umbilical cord in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that formerly was considered to be biomedical garbage there is full of a rich blood of cells mother that they can be used for the treatment of serious illnesses as the leukemia. 
" We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the putting in the bank of our thousandth sample of blood of the umbilical cord and more than thousand of these hopes to be extracted for year. 
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginnig of next year ", adds Doctor D�cary who describes this program of blood capture of drawstring as very popular. 
" Many moms are disappointed of not being able to enjoy this ", since H�ma-Qu�bec has no resources to propose this complex and costly program in all the hospitals of Quebec. 
Softbol - The Impact in the semifinals

Shortly? The victorious goal of Kovalev 
The trio number one of the Canadian is ready to tackle the period. 
The unit consisted of Alex Kovalev, Captures Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn Bell cheered the attack up in a profit for 3-2 of the Canadian to the free kicks barrier opposite to the Panthers of Florida, yesterday in the night, in the Center. 
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two helps, and Kovalev I gather a pass in this profit, the quarter of the Tricolor in six preparatory parties. 
Kovalev gave the victory scoring the only goal. 
" I am not yet ready, he prepared the Russian. 
" I need another party to feel comfortable. " 
It tried to play to the maximum in the first time, Guido Carbonneau noted down. 
But I think that it appreciated the end of the party. 
It had a beautiful applause. " 
Charest deals with the North 
The prime minister does not exclude of starting elections before the ends of the year 
As soon as it finishes the general council of the liberal Party, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-heel, in Quebec, where the new minister of the Health, Yves Bolduc (of left side), tries to make to choose during the partial election of today. 
To push back the limits of our last big border of the north ": such is the ambition in the long term that Jean Charest presented strongly visually remaining in the big lines, at the end of the general council of the liberal Party of Quebec, in L�vis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected. 
They were parading, on three immense screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, of mining development, of Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc. 
Big means like during the electoral period. 
The prime minister thinks that the elections will take place this autumn, although he made to see that his schedule was very full. 
The " North Plane " is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister tries to have for Quebec, that of a " new economic zone ", who understands an agreement on the labour with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and armon�as with Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speeches of the prime minister recently, the opening of the North - the north territory to 49 � parallel - had never been an object of a presentation. 
The prime minister limited nevertheless to explain why the North was " a jewel to the immense potential ", but it gave a term, neither amounts of investment, nor precise priority in the future projects. 
What might be especially more developed sound: particularly the hydroelectricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, dopado for the growth of the emergent countries and the reconstruction of the public infrastructures. 
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond ", according to the enumeration of Mr. Charest. 
This " territory twice big as France ", " it is our house, it is in Quebec. 
Not only it is to our house, but it is in us ", he insisted, as for to show that it was requesting a founding national myth. 
Quebec was constructed very much thanks to his relation with the North, underlined: the flood towards the gold in Abitibi, the engineering quebequesa, the Bay James. 
" It us belongs, it is our future ", he added, after having done a theatrical break to contemplate the map immense behind him. 
The North, 70 % of the territory quebequ�s, understands a part of the Labrador that Quebec always claimed, added the prime minister during the press conference. 
" It is a traditional position that all the governments repeated. 
There is a line of border in which they do not go in agreement long ago and, when the occasion appears, I repeat that position on behalf of the government ", it indicated. 
Also, " with the climatic changes, it is necessary to rethink to our vision of the North ", he declared speaking about the passage of the northwest, which will open to itself every year due to the smelting of the ices. 
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister thinks that to occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuites? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly to the young people. 
Two ancient ministers who come from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel L�tourneau (ancient deputy of the party quebequ�s of Ungava), already they began consultations next to an about thirty of communities. 
An interdepartmental committee presided by Beno�t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural resources) has an important role it began some works. 
The prime minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit ", but a meeting in which " a common vision will happen ". 
The development of the North would do in conformity with the beginning of the sustainable development. 
The North Plan " will be coordinated, arrange and respectful of the environment ", he promised. 
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the first liberal ministers who him preceded. 
" As the liberal ones that preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform the challenges into new occasions of growth and of development. " 
This was one of the topics appellants of weekend, which it began on Friday with a big coctail to underline 50 � anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage to the power of the party. 
One of the adopted resolutions is proposed by him to re-baptize the Head office Beauharnois in Reservoir Ad�lard-Godbout. 
" Of Godbout, which created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that did the calm Revolution and the nationalization of the hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that did the Bay James our party could forge the future ", Juan Charest declared. 
In the press conference, it invoked another reference, conservative that one, the program " Roads to the North " of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 until 1963. 
Touching the topic of the project of hydroelectric reservoir of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest underlined that his putting in service is foreseen for 2012. 
" This remains between us, but I foresee to be there ", he entrusted his militants, causing applauses. 
Really, the prime minister, who was saying in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and undoubtedly not in 2009, did not discard the possibility of starting a voting this autumn, what the law allows him. 
He underlines that his schedule is nevertheless a full house, particularly because of a mission of the council of the federation in China and a Quebec-new summit York York. 
The general council of weekend supplied the liberal chief a platform that was containing nationalistic resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of the Quebec claims in particular the recognition of " especificidad of Quebec " in the Constitution. 
He wishes also Quebec to name members of the Council of the broadcasting and of the Canadian telecommunications and that these have a right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec. 
Of the side of the opposition, we received the big lines of the North Plan with skepticism. 
The boss of the party quebequ�s, Pauline Marois, made to highlight the Politics of development of the North of Qu�bec that the government Landry had thrown in 2001. 
According to her, the liberal government, coming to the power in 2003, resigned to apply it. 
If it had done it, " we would do progressed nowadays " Mrs. Marois commented next to his candidate in Jean-heel (voting that was carried out today), Fran�oise Mercure. 
The Democratic Action of the Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan on behalf of the government. 
" But what is wished, is that this is not just a spectacle ", mentioned the leader Sebastien Proulx, in replacement of Mario Dumont, that it returns of vacation today. 
Lettering - A dishonored country 
He is Mr. Vic Toews, the ex-minister of the "Justice" (oh irony!) in the office Harper, who was affording last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada. 
To dishonor this way this woman who took an incessant combat for the justice and who deserves all our admiration what says everything on the relations of the prime minister and of Stephen Harper. 
We are facing a government that is the only one, between all the western implied countries, that has not repatriated his national who is shut up in the field of concentration of Guant�namo. 
It is a government that it does not bear in mind by any means the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young adolescent when the facts that are reproached him happened. 
The only government that, in spite of the fact of which Canada signed the Agreement of Geneva, denies his promise and a child - soldier allows to live in inhuman conditions. 
The only one that chonta with a false justice to evaluate the guilt of the accused. 
Let's remember that the UNICEF, International Amnesty and the Association of the Canadian lawyers, particularly, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to which he should enjoy the benefit of an equitable process in Canada. 
It is this government that closes the eyes on the torture: little imports for him that an adult young man is psychologically destroyed, undoubtedly forever after so many years of exactions. 
We do not realize yet that, but we assist in this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy", this is the word that Harper continues repeating and that has no sense. 
There has already come the hour in which no morality exists any more: we can ill-treat, torture, imprison arbitrariamente a Canadian citizen as the boss of Government wants till now minority (what will happen after October 14?). 
Many electors believe that they will find the salvation in a party that praises the Virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government resigned what was doing the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
Mr. Toews the shame is provoked by this resignation and by nothing more. 
Free opinion - The speech orwelliano of Barrick Gold 
In his edition of September 17, Devoir published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president and the director of the Canadian miner Barrick Gold. 
Following an orwelliana logic, Barrick Gold affirms that the biggest auriferous company in the world tried a process for defamation for six million euros against three authors and a small publshing house in order to provoke a " public transparent debate ". 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, is not true he that judge, especially in case of pursuits for defamation, but the law. 
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver. 
Porqu�, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way of taking a public debate be to harm whoever dares to support a position opposite to his? 
The result of the suit has little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book To nongo Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare his defense and to fight, with very unequal weapon, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner. 
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, are often they consist of ruining the defendants in order to impose a friendly arrangement that will gag the opposition in addition to whoever scares it will dare to examine again the question. 
If Barrick Gold truly had wanted a public debate, it is in the public opinion that it would have had to present his vision of the facts. 
Contrariamente to what it does to itself in several of countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates in Canada do normally for the change of ideas and not to blows of club. 
It was enough so that the miner was opening his books, his records and was establishing a real debate, across the newspapers, the mass media, the publications and the financing of teams independent from search that might have clarified the question. 
Pero Barrick Gold seems not to trust in the public opinion and pushes back the requests and the letters of support for the authors of Canada Nongoes. 
Possibly Mr. might Garver to explain how he can ask for a "public" debate despising the opinions of this one? 
According to the vice-president, it seems that this word designates only the very full lawyers and not for everything the Canadians; that represents a very limited sight of the concept. 
In democracy, the detractors have also the right to speak. 
What it does not understand - or what does not want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and of Nongoing Canada does it to the publishers especially because it pushes back the brutal way of the miner. 
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge it, but taking civilized changes of arguments as a base, and not in the frame of what many persons perceive as a pursuit - gag (chasing the " public debate ", Barrick Gold has just deposited a request with regard to the authors of Canada Nongoes announcing them to that they do not use any more this word). 
In addition to the speech surreal of Mr. Garver, the process of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of university search and of the truth, essential pair all the democratic societies. 
He denies the right to quote believable sources and to do a debate on the facts and the interpretations, which represent the base of the intellectual work. 
If it is impossible to study and to discuss subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country as Canada, on pain of many pursuits, the one who will be able to do it? 
If Barrick Gold truly wanted a public and transparent debate, it might do it following the scientific norms used by the authors of Canada Nongoing. 
He has a right of response. 
The university world, to which we belong, can long ago administer the debates and the disagreements and solve the conflicts. 
The enormous pursuit of Barrick Gold shows clearly that, contrariamente to what he claims, it does not want to do a transparent debate. 
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is already time that the governments place devices that limit this genre of excessive pursuits. 
Operation of rescue of Wall Street - Democrats and republicans they agree 
The administration Bush and the leaders of the Congress, simultaneously republican and democratic, finally they came to an agreement yesterday on the most important plan of economic rescue from the Big Depression of the 30s. 
The new version of the plan for 700 billion American dollars that tries to brake the financial crisis that shakes Wall Street for months has to be still confirmed by both Chambers of the Congress. 
He foresees particularly: a better control on the part of chosen of his putting in application, of new mechanisms that try to assure the refund of the public inverted money, of the new dispositions to contain the number of impeded houses the absence of payment, as well as a right of inspection on the wages paid to the leaders of the handy companies. 
The American secretary of the Treasure, Henry Paulson, the president of the Chamber of the Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the republican representative in the table of negotiations, the senator Judd Gregg, announced that the good news some minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations che lasted two days. 
" We realize big progresses with a view to an agreement that will be effective on the markets ", there declared the representative of the administration Bush, Henry Paulson. 
" Everything has been a fact to put to cutlery the economy and the ordinary Americans before the current crisis in Wall Street ", told the democrat. 
" It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the traumatism, the chaos and the perturbations on the daily life of the Americans will be immense ", the republican Judd Gregg declared. 
The negotiations had been finished very rapidly in the last hours because they were afraid of the effect that would provoke a new defeat in the humor of the investors. 
Last hour that had been fixed was the opening of the markets this morning. 
Two candidates in the presidential American elections, who have adhered late to the negotiations, proved to be rather favorable for the agreement, without forgetting to squeeze nevertheless his dissatisfaction of to be forced to come to this extremity. 
The democratic senator Barack Obama awarded his certain dispositions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow the owners to preserve his domicile and her on the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies for the State. 
" When it is asked the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, it is not necessary to congratulate. 
But these measurements are necessary ", he mentioned in the American television. 
His republican adversary, John McCain, Interrogated in another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, answered that: " I would like to see the details, but it hope to be voted by me. " 
" The important points that I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with that we will be able to pass. 
He said that the option not to do anything is not acceptable ". 
The plan of 700 billions tries to buy with the money of the taxpayers the doubtful debts, the assets to risks and unsaleable of the financial American institutions. 
It comes after 14 months of a crisis provoked by the explosion of a real estate bubble that first led to the subsidence of the mortgage credits of risk before spreading to other more common forms of credit qualifications (PCAA) and before provoking a frostbite of liquidity and a rush of the banks and of the financial institutions. 
It is a group of chosen republicans that it had made change the first project of agreement, last week. 
We believe that we have gone out of the stagnation since the democrats accepted that certain "poisonous" assets of the companies in difficulty are assured only by the government, rather that bought. 
With the target to file the roughnesses for the whole world in the Congress, also we add a disposition that it was stipulating that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it might impose new valuations that it would try to help to recover money. 
The new plan foresees the payment of the first part of 250 billions to which 100 other billions will be able to be added if it seems necessary to the president. 
The payment of another 350 billions would have to be confirmed by another vote on behalf of the Congress. 
On the other hand of his help, Washington will obtain participations in the handy companies that will cost him dividends in case of profit and that it will be able to sell again when the thunderstorm will be past. 
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the procedures of sequestrations that were concerning the housings obtained with real estate loans as this plan, as well as fixing limits on the remuneration and on the compensations in cash paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis. 
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the voting of the Chamber of the representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday. 
In spite of all his efforts, he is not sure yet that his plan will be approved. 
Some persons continued protesting yesterday against this project, so much on behalf of the republicans as the democrats. 
The republican Scott Garrett, member of the commission of the finance of the camera, declared his electorate that " with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand ". 
" We have a very serious financial problem. 
A few solutions exist. 
But the one that consists of extracting profit of the taxpayers ". 
The democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is a quizmaster of a small group in the Congress, presents the problems otherwise, but it comes to the same conclusion. 
" Four hundred teachers of economy, between whom three Nobel Prizes, they wrote to us to say to us: we ask to the Congress not to hurry and examine attentively the route that is necessary to take ", he declared yesterday. 
In the same moment, in Europe, we had again the test of the world nature of the crisis. 
After an urgent meeting, three countries of the Benelux announced the partial nationalization of the bank group Fortis for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, Netherlands and of Luxembourg it had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas was announcing that he was resigning to buy his competitor in failure since it lost 2 billion euros (2,9 billion dollars) during the crisis of the real estate loans of risk in the United States. 
Fortis uses 85 000 persons and it is a part of the twenty biggest European banks and of the ten biggest insurers. 
" This is not a lost money, there declared yesterday the Dutch minister of the Finance, Wouter Bos. 
On the other hand, we recover a right to vote in the bank and influence. 
It is exactly something that the savers and the families were appreciating now that the times are uncertain. " 
During this time, to another side of the Spot, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that suffers the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government Bradford would take charge of all the hanging loans in the bank and Bringley and more than 41 billion euros (75,5 billion dollars) of real estate loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that is the one that would buy the divisions and the bank accounts of the British bank. 
The bank Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, which the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an awkward icon 
His blue eyes represented therefore time his victory. 
Had the American actor with a charming smile been liberated of his side narcissist? 
Yes and not. 
His decency, his sensibility and a talent that was clear also it will have removed from the record of power that have the real sacred monsters. 
But what big stayer! 
Paul Newman, dead person on Friday, to 83 years, because of a cancer of lung in his mess of Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of the years fastos. 
It is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom it was looking alike very much and that was considered to be by a lot of time a rival in the cinema more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of the freedom and of the explosion of the dramatic agreements. 
Magnificent children do the mixed bloods often. 
He was born in Ohio in 1925, of Jewish German father and of Hungarian mother of origin. 
Of these European roots there will be born one of the glorious faces of the American sleep. 
Without ego enormous, last quality mark. 
Because in him there was projected the whole country in love with the self made man, with the combatant of the war of the Pacific Ocean, hurt in combat, who at the beginnig of the 50s studied the dramatic art in yale, then it frequented Actor's Studio of New York, before triumphing in the theater, in the television and soon in the cinema. 
This man who milit� for the civil rights was also the motor pilot who classified under the second position in 24 hours of Him Mans in 1979 doubled by a sex symbol, although member of a partner shapes formed from 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
They eliminate also with him the secret sides of this secret, star discreet and awkward, allergic to the scandals of the world of the spectacle that we do not know very well. 
He is an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word. 
The death of Paul Newman provoked the dizziness the cin�filos this weekend, whereas his big roles collide on the black screen of the memories. 
More than one half century of the seventh American art in perpetual change parades across him. 
Many memories return to memory as the cow-boy with delight of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man that there pushes back his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the roof of adapted zinc of Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive mister Bridge disturbed by a marriage who was not fulfilling all his promises. 
Others as Paul Newman have gone on to the history of the cinema. 
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by the hate), of Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly threw Newman in 1956. 
This nice thief in the sumptuous movie The Sting (The Blow), Oscar to the best movie in 1973. 
Player of bitter and avenging billiards in the magnificent movie The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), will repeat the personage in The Color of Money de Martin Scorsese, which cost him in 1987 his only Oscar between nine nominations. 
This face that changes with the years, was it. 
Still he. 
The epochs change during his career. 
The young people knows it especially thanks to Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, trainer of a team of hockey on slightly orthodox ice. 
His fans saw it again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen. 
With a godfather's last role of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition de Sam Mendes in 2003, the curl was curled. 
Contrariamente to several legends of the cinema that left quite soon the career, Newman remained great in the world of the cinema, denouncing Hollywood, his oros, his fastos and his authorizations. 
The French film maker Bertrand Tavernier was considering it, with humor, " as a challenge through that the underplaying lives in " " and that judges his too supported services. 
The profession was not always easy for beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles came during a lot of time without doing anything. 
Nevertheless he interpreted less often the role of young lady's man that of marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, he-goats or desperadoes, whose features reflected the rebellions. 
As producer, Newman revealed sides his real modest sensibility not very well-known. 
His movie Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the principal role, was describing a feminine portrait of melancholy. 
He that lost his son Scott because of overdose dedicated his movie Harry and They are in 1984, work of decency and of sadness. 
" Between the numerous homage that broke loose yesterday for Newman, his big friend and ancient partner of weapon Robert Redford (they had been employed together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) he was affirming, much saddened: " my life and my country were better thanks to his existence " 
Generosity, love of the existence are important features of the deceased actor. 
Of another side of his career of legend, a big militant hides also for the civil rights, the ecology, the independent cinema, the argumentative one against the excesses of Hollywood. 
We will have seen his face reigning very much on the boats of sauce vinaigrette, of the sauces, of the cookies and of other food, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag. 
The profits of this selling were given to his Foundation for the infancy in difficulty. 
Newman, rather that to be satisfied of his myth, will have committed himself up to the end. 
They were left to his five daughters by a letter that was containing these phrases: " always and up to the end, your father was incredibly grateful by his good star. 
It was a privilege of being there. " 
And a privilege for us of having continued the career of such a lucid American and so generous artist. 
In short a civil model. 
What were they producing in the factory of invoices Zuschlag? Co.? 
Very soon, on October 8, the penal process will begin against J�nos Zuschlag and his accomplices. 
There are accused the politician and to his accomplices of committing frauds of significant damage, of way of business, continuously and in form organized in addition to other crimes, between these the falsification of documents. 
According to the District attorney's office they used for proper ends the funds obtained in the public contests justifying in many occasions the fulfillment of the tasks with false invoices. 
The public funds and that of the town halls - in his totality approximately 65 million HUF - stopped partly in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partly in the pocket of particular persons. 
The method, which was announced by the investigators also, was to justify the cashing of the funds obtained in the public contests with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different affiliations never fulfilled his obligations assumed. 
According to the accusation, the majority of the invoices were false. 
For it they obtained the checkbooks on the market of the District of J�zsefv�ros and the circular stamps were made in the city of Kiskunhalas. 
And the question of which on behalf of what company did it have to realize the falsified invoice between others were decided in that tour along the Top Region of the Balat�n to where J�nos Zuschlag sent Istv�n Lados. 
The last one confessed that for this end it had to choose cheap hotels and restaurants. 
He asked for invoice for his consumptions and these served as model to make the invoices that presented between others in the Juvenile and Sports contests of the State Department, in the Social Security Department and Labor, as well as in the Town hall of the Capital. 
Were these invoices signed mostly by Istv�n Lados and his accomplice Andr�s? ri, who according to our informations rather was writing the necessary reports to obtain the public subsidies. 
During one of his " trips of study " Lados chose a brewery. 
According to two invoices sent in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided the meal for a group of ninety persons of the Association Biztos Pont Egyes�let. 
Nevertheless - according to the manager of the center - so many persons they do not fit simultaneously in this place. 
Of equal way, the invoice sent in the summer of 2002 for the Foundation Jobb J�v? �rt - later called Egy�tt to Harmadik �vezred�rt - was full of formal errors and contextuales. 
Since a cheap hotel of the locality of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and any more than ten persons could not stay there during one night, nevertheless in the invoice hundred and thirty persons were consisting. 
But did the manufacturers of invoice of big fantasy also exaggerate when they indicated to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft since in the tenedur�a of books of the same one - according to the informations started to the District attorney's office - there were no documents addressed to Jobb J�v? �rt and of Hopp�. 
Gy? z? Farkas, the manager of the above mentioned company, informed him to hvg.hu that when it was quoted by the district attorney's office and they showed him the invoices, it was already known that it was a question of false documents. 
" In the stamp the name of our company and the NIF was appearing in incorrect place. " 
He added: in addition to the formal problems he was not also reconciling that according to the invoice hundred persons stayed, since they have only eleven rooms in which so many persons do not fit. 
Also, in the invoice meals were included also, whereas the restaurant some time ago that does not work. 
The enthusiasts manufacturers of invoices did not also find out that the agency of trips chosen in Budapest organizes exclusively trips abroad, so that in the invoice of payment in cash they indicated tontamente as service a trip inside Hungary, which was not coinciding with the practice of expedition of invoices of the agency either. 
Also - as it was known during the investigation - they included in the document the VAT also, although the trips out of the territory of the European Union were exempt from taxes. 
Between other things was the measurement of the VAT also incorrect in four documents sent by the Hotel R�vf�l�p Kft for the foundation Jobb J�v? �rt, since the services of the above mentioned company are not loaded by 25 but only by 15 per cent of VAT, also the employees of the hotel only were extending invoices done to machine nevertheless the invoice was manual. 
Also the "shippers" committed other errors also, like in case of a company in that they put in the invoice as realized activity the transport for highway to which - it was known during the investigations of the district attorney's office - it does not realize the company founded as consultant of investments. 
Equally by formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that there are false the invoices sent for Egy�tt to Harmadik �vezred�rt Alap�tv�ny, for the XXIst. Sz�zadi Kultur�lis Egyes�let and for Biztos Pont. 
As in case of Ravenna Bt or the Sports Camp of Kunfeh�rt�, whose representatives denied to have sent these invoices. 
The forgers did not also pay attention to that when the group of Fiatal V�ros�rt Egyes�let was eating there (2001) the HIB Kft. de Ny�regyh�za was in process of liquidation, that's why the manager of the process of liquidation - according to our informations - was denying to have sent such a document. 
They sent consciously the invoices 
Another group of the manufacturers of false invoices are constituted by those those who were conscious of that they had to send fictitious invoices. 
The Foundation Es�ly Budapest�rt Alap�tv�ny, on request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj� Szocialist�k, sent invoice at the price of approximately four million HUF addressed to the Foundation Egy�tt to Harmadik �vezred�rt. 
To the manager of Collab Kft. - according to the accusation - it was convinced by one of the accused, Ludovic Gy�rfi, to send fictitious invoices. 
Of equal way he was collaborating with Zuschlag and his accomplices Biogate Kft., at present under process of liquidation, which in 2003 gave invoices for an approximate value of five million HUF to the foundation Jobb J�v? �rt Alap�tv�ny, to the affiliation Atlasz Egyes�let and to the affiliation V�r�sfeny? Egyes�let, without economic real activity behind. 
Neither was capital movement, so later they annulled the prepared invoices but they forgot to point out in his documents to this entity. 
In the following group of the manufacturers of false invoices there are included those that have some link with the accused. 
This way for example Iv�n Kubatov was the demandadero of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trio SL with head office fictitiously in Budapest, which was dealing with the commerce of fuels and of vehicles. 
This company sent numerous invoices for an approximate value of 18 million HUF in October, November and December, 2005 on the selling of computer means. 
According to the information of the investigation these invoices were bought by Cash Investment Kft. de Kiskunhalas, which from September 14, 2005 is low process of liquidation. 
The manager of this company was a Rumanian to whom Iv�n Kubatov should have finished also the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005. 
We have informations of which Kubatov admitted during the investigation that it sent addressed to the company invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hopp� and for Egy�tt to Harmadik �vezred�rt Alap�tv�ny receiving the amount he himself. 
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft and Jos-Investment Bt were founded for Rumanian bricklayers on request it expresses of Iv�n Kubatov. 
Nevertheless, none of the companies worked really owed - according to the accused - to whom they did not receive work. 
But it extracted profit of these companies, since on request of his accomplice lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the documents of record of the company, they were sending invoices addressed to the societies for the organizations linked with Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Gener�ci�. 
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, of Delta Tri�, of Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and the Linaxtrade gave in whole 15 invoices to different entities for a value of 14,2 million HUF. 
The District attorney's office thought that Kubatov was receiving the VAT and 10 % of the amount of the invoices. 
This man was useful even the society in silent partnership Szi-Beri to send fictitious invoices used in the contest of Biztos Pont. 
The Y-Gener�ci� and Sz�vets�g presented a contest to Modern Magyarorsz�g�rt in January, 2006 to T�ncsics Mih�ly Alap�tv�ny (TMA), entity of public utility of the Socialistic Party. 
Of the contest they obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but they did not use the money for the targets of the contest. 
So that this is not discovered, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. 
These were the invoices found during the record of the office that �rp�d Kemecsei had in the head office of the Department of Education. 
Part of the accused probably will report in the judgment - as they did in the District attorney's office - the course of the falsification of the invoices. 
The most interesting thing there will be able to be the confession of the proper principal accused J�nos Zuschlag, if it decides to dismantle everything. 
Since his confessions till now have not been very detailed and although reiteratedly he promised to speak about everything, this has not done it up to the present. 
The question is: what interest does it have to do?, since perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the Socialists came to an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all the responsibilities. 
Who, on the other hand, for these days even could take offence, since to relieve his prison conditions it requested house arrest, but there was denied he reiteratedly. 
Whereas the numerous authors of economic crimes of very top value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least they can wait in their own hearth for the judgment, he has no possibility for that. 
Psychology of the superimposed ones: why do we spend more money? 
The participants of the auctions are inclined to spend more money and to overvalue the product. 
The neurologists and economists of the University of New York discovered the neurological bases - economic of this well-known and seemingly irrational conduct. 
According to the study appeared in the magazine Science, the people do not want to lose in competences as the auctions of eBay, that's why he prefers paying even an excessive price. 
The scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions. 
One of the groups of volunteers was playing lottery, other was taking part in an auction and meanwhile one was examining by means of the system of magnetic functional resonance (fMRI) the active zones of the brain of the persons taking part in the experiment. 
In both games the participants could gain money, but during the auctions, where it is a fundamental element to bet more than other, on having lost the game, so-called stratum located under the cerebral cortex intensified the functioning of the complex. 
This zone of the brain, in addition to many other functions, redeems a role in the mechanism of " car rewarded " of the nervous system. 
This way according to the scientists, the increase of the bets is explained as a prevention not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum. 
To base his theory, the economists of the scientific group realized also a study of financial pursuit. 
In this experiment three groups bet against a person in different circumstances. 
Simply one communicated the real value of the product to the control group in question, and his members bet. 
In addition to it it was promised to another group that if they win, they would receive 15 more dollars of award. 
On the other hand, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the members of the group were losing even this money. 
This way the only difference between two groups was that for one the victory was highlighted and for other the defeat. 
Nevertheless, verifying the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group who were playing " against the defeat " were ready to bet even more than the members of the control group and of the "winning" group. 
" These results cannot be deduced of any economic existing theory previously. 
Since those till now were explaining the phenomena of the auctions only with the happiness to win and with the prevention of the risks. 
Only the neurological visual methods helped to solve this contradiction between two theories, so that now we come to a third explanation " - there established Andrew Schotter, teacher of the faculty of economy of the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: when is it necessary to go to the doctor? 
In the world approximately five hundred million persons suffer of hepatitis B or C chronicles, and in Hungary the chronic illness of the liver is considered to be one of the principal causes of the death. 
The number is calculated in hundred thousand of infected in this country, but only seven thousand receive treatment since many of the patients do not know that they are infected. 
The denomination of hepatitis is the common name of different illnesses of the liver caused by virus. 
The symptoms look alike very much; they are typical the infection of the liver and the jaundice, but his pathogenic agents and the caused illnesses are very different. 
The viruses of the hepatitis in dependency on the pathogenic reagent propagate by means of two principal forms: the hepatitis A and E for food route (for example with water or infected food), the hepatitis B, C, D and other virus with the blood and with corporal humors (sperm, humor of the vagina, saliva). 
It is advisable to the travelers to be protected by means of vaccine against the virus A and B, against C vaccines do not exist. 
The symptoms of the hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, it demonstrates by means of a bad general state, weakness, abdominal pain and morning sickness. 
After it they appear in the skin and in the target of the eyes the jaundice, the excrement becomes clear, the urine of dark color and the healing can last even two - three weeks. 
Annually a million persons die in the world in cancer and hepatic cirrhosis caused by the hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this illness. 
The principal reason of it is that according to the calculations, only one of every infected ten receives pharmacological treatment. 
The hepatitis C also can have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce hepatic cirrhosis and even cancer. 
The majority of the infected ones does not know that it is sick because this pathological agent destroys in gradual form the cells of the liver and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later. 
Therefore there is very important the premature recognition, the medical systematical control. 
This illness is much more frequent in three groups: the persons who had blood transfusion before 1991, the consumers of drugs and those who take tattooes. 
At present there are approximately 200 million persons in the world who endure of hepatitis C chronicle. 
Since to this illness it is possible to discover with a routine control of laboratory also, it is worth consulting with the doctor of the family on having experienced some unknown symptom. 
The illness has healing if it is discovered on time, it is possible to exterminate the virus of the organism, this way it is possible to suppress the contagion and prepare the cancer. 
September 30 is the World Day of the Hepatitis, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representatives of the patients. 
His target is to attract attention to the causes of the chronic infections of the liver caused by the viruses and to the importance of his premature recognition. 
Does it hurt him less to whom they believe in God? 
According to the result of a recent investigation, the religious faith has tranquilizing effect that was relieving also the death of the martyrs of the Catholicism. 
The scientists of the Oxford University realized an interesting experiment: they analyzed of that the religious credence in what way it influences the human pain - the periodic Briton Telegraph reported. 
In the frame of this singular experiment they applied electrical shock to 12 catholic believers and to the same atheists' quantity, meanwhile they all were looking at a painting of Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, the catholic believers were capable of excluding most of his pain. 
Thanks to the skill of escaneo of the human brain, it was possible to verify that the catholic believers were capable of activating that part of his brain that is responsible for the regulation of the pain. 
This experiment is the first one of the series of investigations in which next to the academicians there take part also scientists, philosophers and theologians of the different departments of the University. 
The analysis happened of the following way; they fixed a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the patient, who was applying the electrical shock. 
The investigators him asked the participants of the experiment to fix his look in two paintings; to Virgin Mary, work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and to the Lady of the ermine of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century. 
The investigators had the hope that the spectacle of Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious fortitude between the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from other, and thought that it had soothing effect. 
The patients spent half an hour in a scanner of MRI, receiving in this period 20 electrical shocks in four successive parts while they were observing the painting of religious topic or other. 
The Catholics affirmed that, on having looked at Virgin Mary, they were feeling in " safety " as "protected" persons, " they calmed down and in his heart he was reigning the peace ". 
On having observed the picture of religious topic, they were feeling 12 per cent less of pain that when they were looking at Leonardo's work. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also took part in the experiment, thinks that with any image so impactante it is possible to obtain a similar effect with the atheists also, only it is necessary to find the suitable image. 
" We should find the portrait of a person for which they feel very positively, like for a mother or a father " - the psychologist said. 
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation. 
" The exercise of the faith should and in many cases really it changes our personality " - Wright added. 
After these formidable results only one question stays: what effect would it have for the regulation of the pain if one was showing him to the faithful Madonna de Leonardo or of another painter of his height? 
Perhaps would the vision of a Virgin Mary of high quality throw even better results? 
This are what you say about you himself 
In his tenth birthday the Google he can affirm: it is possible to find him both in the pocket of the people, and in the sky over his head; he knows where his vacation happened, what doctors they visit and what is what they are interested in. 
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is still not sufficient. 
On the other hand the skeptics who do the parallel one with the vision orweliana do not see the essence of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt not long ago declared to the newspaper Financial Times that the principal target of Google is to assemble the biggest possible quantity of personal information on his users, and this is necessary to be able to fulfill the original targets of the founders of Google: " let's assemble in a system all the informations of the world! ". 
According to the leader of the Google, the company even after ten years of work that rummaged to the World is still in the initial phase of the determination to be able to treat all the information. 
To the question that what is what is going to spend in five years Schmidt answered this way: I would like that the Google could answer the questions as: " What to do tomorrow? " or: " What would be the work that better would be convenient for me? " - nevertheless, the software they will not be able to answer questions seemingly so simple while sufficient informations of the users do not exist. 
Not all the Net users are conscious of that during his navigation in the Network looked keys store exactly the words, the directions of IP and the pages to where they went on on having finished the search. 
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that made debut two years ago, the users can store their own record of navigation, can consult again for what they were looking earlier, which they opened and thanks to this record it will generate searches much more personalized - on the same logic the Recommendations will be based, in that the system will offer us products and services in base of the preferences previously definite and stored. 
What will happen if they make use of my information against me himself, if they gather informations about my activities? - there ask those users who worry seeing the informative monopoly of Google. 
In the majority of the cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and a not the remorse, the fear for the punishment, the wish for the freedom or the rebellion against the power. 
Nevertheless it is an already confirmed fact that not only they preserve, but in justifiable cases also they transfer to third all the looked expressions, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of the Net users. 
The most debated example of last times was perhaps the action coordinated against the Brazilian ped�filos, when Google delivered to the Brazilian government his the informations of his page of Web, so-called Orkut, to identify the ped�filos. 
On the other hand, the Net users who worry for the rights of the persons, in May got better when the company together with the EFF, organization for the defense of the electronic rights, demonstrated successfully before the court that it was right in his litigation with the FBI: according to the judgment, it will not be possible to force him Google, by means of any of the points of the constitution to give any type of information requested secretly by the FBI. 
(At the same time the federal government managed to obtain so pretext of reinforcing the protection law of the approved infancy years behind, next to fifty thousand directions of Web and approximately thousand looked phrases, but without obtaining the lists of search of the individual users, not neither the finished lists of Web pages and of words keys of last two months.) 
This way the opinion about the Google is quite contradictory: it is criticized by those that are afraid to give his personal information because they think that his intimacy, his life is harmed deprived on having begun to use the services of Google, and rebels against her like against the multinational companies of conservative image. 
Meanwhile, the culture geek North American and his enthusiasts followers, Net users and users of other countries, see in them the future generation, the " corporation of avant-garde ", not like that to his rival, the Microsoft catalogued by his Windows as conqueror of the World, for much that both fight for the same target. 
This can happen because the Google unlike the Microsoft, he asks of the users neither for any code of identification, nor money for his applications, the code is opened and the bundle of free program, constantly update and it seems more juvenile, more collaborator than the practice of the official giant of the software. 
But it can be also because the geek see exactly the very problematic existing relation between the rights of the persons and the Internet that produced to itself exactly for one of the words keys most mentioned in the last years: the Web 2.0. 
The Web 2.0 is a question about the collaboration, of leaving deliberate traces behind us and of making use of the available channels of communication, and while it changes measurements of these individually, the essence keeps on being the same: to appear to us same. 
A normal young man can have profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook up to Xanga, and it even can join them with other services, as for example the Twitter or the last.fm that offers list of his customs of music, later it can include these in a system of pursuit as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, can have also a blog, in which there appear automatically the most recent galleries of photos that are stored in the Flickr or in the Picasa. 
We can know numerous cases of which it gets rid that for example the fianc�e, on having seen the flow of photography of the following morning of the common friends, finds out with whom his fraudulent fianc� happened the previous night or they can dismiss the employee of a company because this one writes his sincere opinion in his blog on the direction of the company: a thing is sure, the definition of the private life was revalued completely. 
The life " on line " of a person is what she shows of yes same - this is the definition that one hides behind the conduct of the youth of our days. 
And the one that wants to conceal something, or at least it tries to avoid the monopoly of Google, can do it (beginning for example with the Scroogle that uses the system of search of Google, but it does not leave traces). 
There are many persons who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent from being able to find them, but the applications can be replaced " on line " of Google, from the software of writing of texts up to the applications of image and reading of news with alternative versions which neither get connected with gigantic servants nor prepare the profile as perfect as possible on us. 
The public opinion waits almost that openly the day in which the Google should show his real face. 
The company with his current value for 156 billion dollars costs more than the IBM (140 billion dollars), the Intel (124 billion dollars) or the Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), the surfaces of publicity of AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of the advertising agencies, while the services that interfere more and more rapidly cause serious headaches not only for the Microsoft, but also to numerous other companies developers of software. 
The critical observers nevertheless, they will find the alarming contradictions also: for example the top direction pushed the protest of the employees back roundly after duplicating the price of the nursery of the company, thought too expensive the unlimited number of feeding of the employees, but all this is not at all compared to the fact that in the year 2006 the Google yielded before the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement leaked all information that was violating the good morality and the interests of the Chinese diet. 
One of the internal regulations of the company says that they will not announce any new service with advance, but only when it was already ready to work, which if it is sure is that the foreseeable problems of next months and years they will be able to rummage to the World: whereas some of them believe that the project of escaneo and file of books and magazines of Google will acquire such dimensions that the company soon will be quoted by the Supreme Court of the United States, others are afraid of his system Health, because in her we can create our own sanitary finished profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems. 
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it will be able to provide a good raw material for the writers of works of science fiction, the Scroogled, novel of the popular one of Cory Doctorow, there describes in form orweliana future that one, in which a man only of the information of the Google can be described alarmantemente well. 
Two minors of age helped to erase the traces to the author of the double murder of the city of �zd. 
The police interrogated two minors of age on the double murder of �zd who, according to based suspicion, helped to erase the traces of the crime - there said on Tuesday the spokesman of the General Police station of Public Order of the province of Borsod. 
Young people they recognized the crime that was imputed to them, and at present they are accused of instigators of the crime. 
Two minors - according to the informations of the Hungarian News agency it is a question of two girls - they will be able to defend oneself at freedom. 
By the complicity they can receive even with 5 years of jail. 
The accused of the double murder of �zd - a 23-year-old man - is in preventive detention from Sunday. 
One accuses him the crime of murdering several persons with premeditation and for greed. 
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old young man owed a big sum to a 53-year-old man.

The reason is that the Stock Exchange of Warsaw is in hands of the state. 
99 per cent of the actions are in hands of the Polish State that in some months wants to sell 60 per cent of the same ones. 
The Czech economic journal E15 informed that the offer of the Poles has been the highest between those who offered for the interested ones in the Stock Exchange of Prague. 
According to the Czech press, till now they gave offer the Stock Exchange of Vienna, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of New York, the Stock Exchange of London and Deutsche B�rse. 
Petr Koblic, the chief of the Stock exchange of Prague declared last week that between the interested ones the worst new owner would be the Stock exchange of Warsaw and did not discard the possibility that with it, in a future it was eliminating the Stock exchange of Prague. 
The experts calculate the value of the Stock Exchange of Prague in approximately 5 to 10 billion crowns.

On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press 
The principal European newspapers in his Tuesdays comments dedicated to the deeper and deeper financial international crisis speak about " second September 11 ". 
The financial global catastrophe owes to itself the North American president - thinks The Republic of Rome - the president has not been capable not at least of obtaining the support of his own party for the made project of law hurriedly, whose target is to give him solution to this exasperating situation... 
Instead of new " Pearl Habor ", about that the investing multimillionaire Warren Buffett was speaking, is more correct to speak about " second September 11 ". 
According to a part of the press of Madrid, Washington is the scapegoat. 
In opinion of The World the error of the political direction of the United States was the one that led to the world economy at the edge of the abyss. 
There grows increasingly the danger of the collapse of the monetary North American system and this then, it will reverberate in the entire world. 
Although the plan of Bush was not perfect, after the voting of the congress the danger arises from that Washington does not offer political instrument to treat to the crisis. 
The world economy is suspended in the air - exactly when there is carried out one of the biggest transformations of the history of the capitalism. 
It is not possible to pay attention omiso at this threat - the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva points. 
Some states today can still throw to him belt of lifebelt to the financial swaying institutions, being able to save them this way from the failure with the money of the taxpayers. 
But if as I dominate them they wear away more bank still, then there will be already sufficient neither the new funds, nor either new improvisations. 
It is necessary in the long term that the member states of the European Union leave aside his nationalistic egoism and centralize the control on the financial fragmented markets. 
The financial institutions in crisis received only on Monday more than 100 billion euros - the Viennese Der Standard remembers, adding that are more and more real the worries of that, as the North Americans did, also the European taxpayers will have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis. 
The EU till now has not dealt seriously with the crisis that happens as a c�name for the Old Continent. 
The "saviors" will not have to present immediately hundreds of million euros, but it would be good if they were defining: in what cases does one justify to use the funds of the taxpayers to avoid a major evil? 
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee 
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of the sensors of existing obstacles in the nature? 
For example that of the bumblebees. 
In a surprising project presented in the CEATEC of Japan, the bumblebees gave the starting point for the engineers of Nissan to design the following generation of the system of prevention of the collisions. 
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, robotics of automobiles designed the system of direction type BR23C imitatively of the nature, which the characteristics of the bumblebees gave him, with the final target to create a system that could avoid all the collisions. 
During the flight every bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks alike very much to our protective capsule of safety - he explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, the technological director of RP and of development and investigations. 
They redeem an important role the eyes consisted of the bumblebees that are capable of seeing in all the directions in an angle superior to 300 grades. 
To copy the function of the compound eyes, the engineers used the system of measurement of the length for beams laser. 
This one identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C inside a distance of 2 meters, in an angle of 180 grades, calculates his distance and sends a sign to the microprocessor of the vehicle that immediately transforms in a maneuver to avoid the collision. 
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumblebees, it modifies the direction turning in the necessary measurement the wheels. 
In contrast to any existing system at present, this maneuver is completely instinctive. 
" If it was not like that, the robot of the vehicle might not react with the sufficient rapidity as to avoid the obstacles " - there explains Toshiyuki Andoh, boss of the Laboratory of Mobility and of the project of the robot of vehicles. 
It must react immediately and in instinctive form, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable interior layer of the protective capsule of safety, in a layer inside which at present all kinds of collisions is considered to be inevitable. 
The whole process must reflect what does a bumblebee to avoid other bumblebees. 
This process must realize in one to open and close the eyes. 
Nevertheless, in contrast to the bumblebees, the movement cannot go up, down or diagonal, but it can be only two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of draft of the wheels 
This way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the bumblebees to avoid other bumblebees, here only the rotary movement and the acceleration used as possibility for the robot of the car also the braking. 
The BR23C uses batteries of l�tio-polymer that are lighter and his thickness of energy is major, which he wants to say that they have a duration of life longer than that of l�tio-i�n. 
According to Andoh, the important thing there is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the capacity of prosecution of the information, not much less that of storage. 
This device in every second just must process some signs of entry and react according to the case. 
It is not necessary to store this information do not even do not even to react with an instinctive logic based on the information of the previous maneuvers, this way it uses only some dozens of kilobytes of memory. 
Memoirs of gigabytes are not needed, not of megabytes. 
This is the first step to develop the technology to avoid immediately the obstacles, which according to calculations of the Nissan, in ten years will be able to join the models made of series. 
Another possibility for his application is to incorporate the unit into the system of navigation for route satellite GPS to take the driver to his destination, avoiding the existing obstacles in his way. 
This most expensive child already has name 
There has been prepared the written version of the law of the bundle of financial rescue for 700 billion dollars that will be applied in several phases with the purpose of buying the bad credits of the banks. 
In the first phase the half of the money will wear out. 
According to schedule of the oriental coast during the new consultations that lasted even after the Saturday midnight, the leaders of the congress came to an agreement concerning the bundle of financial rescue for 700 billion dollars in whole, after several days of discussion - the Reuters reported. 
We have achieved an important progress - there said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the North American Congress, affirming that it is necessary just to formalize the agreement in a document. 
The commitment assumed on the bundle was supported by both candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking on the result of the commitment affirmed: this program will work and be efficient but other measurements are needed more. According to Pelosi, it is not a question of saving Wall Street, but of giving to him turned to the car of the economy. 
The written version of the bundle was published before the gap of the Asian markets, that is to say on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to schedule of Washington (or before two o'clock on Monday morning, according to schedule of Central Europe), without it should provoke a spectacular jump in the bags. 
On the project of law called emergency law for the economic stabilization of the year 2008, the first Monday he will vote for the North American Congress and then the Senate. 
The president George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news on the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress reached during the night and appreciate highly the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy - there declared Tony Fratto, the spokesman of the White House. 
The program is different from the original proposal of the administration of Bush to spend all the 700 billion dollars to buy qualifications values of credit fund of bad quality. 
Now it will only be possible to spend the half of 700 billion dollars, using 250 billions immediately later for that the Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Department of Finance will buy qualifications values of credit fund, of bad qualification and the destination of another 100 billion dollars depends on the decision of the president. 
This program will be controlled by a special organism, in which there will take part also the president of the Federal Reservation. 
Another half of 700 billion dollars will be able to wear out after a new decision of the Congress. 
According to the law the Department of Finance can apply a combined tactics: he will be able to buy simultaneously bad credits, mortgages and qualifications values of credit fund, also other credits of "poisonous" type also. 
The buy will be able to do in auctions or in direct form - competent persons of the department reported. 
He allows the affected companies to inform the law in a program of insurance where the portfolio of finance guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages. 
Henry Paulson affirmed: the law assures of such a way the financial necessary means, that even even 700 billion dollars can come to satisfy the urgent needs of the financial North American system, it be a question of the buy of financial bad means, of his insurance or of the prevention of risks that might provoke the collapse of some big financial institutions. 
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added. 
On the other hand, the chiefs of the banks who are in difficulty and hope that the help of the State they will be able to be provided with the official limitation of his indemnifications, which the North American slang calls simply a golden parachute. 
Only in some certain cases the payments will limit themselves, also the limitations depend on the form of help of the department of finance. 
The limitation means that if the department buys in the frame of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed for the golden parachute, unless the unsuccessful boss of the bank retires. 
On having bought directly the bad credits, the government will intervene aggressively to assure that the indemnifications of the chiefs should not be exaggerated. 
In addition to the previous thing they do not go away to change the contracts of existing parachute of gold, the limitations refer only for the new contracts to stimulate this way also the participation in the program. 
This is the first case in the North American history that a legal limitation will be in validity for the income of the general managers - there commented on the above mentioned measurement the democrat Barney Frank, president of the commission of the Congress, person in charge for the financial services. 
The State will have also right to acquire actions of the banks taking part in the program, this way the risk of the taxpayers will diminish, since finally they will be able even to obtain profit with the deal as soon as the economy recovers and with her the bank. 
According to the project of law in the next five years the president will have to present to the Congress a proposition on the form of how returning to the taxpayers the losses of the financial sector. 
Of course in both sides there was those who expressed his reservations with regard to the project. 
It is not this what the North American citizens entrusted to us, that is to say the dollars of the taxpayers are not protected - there declared the republican conferee of California, Darrell Issa. 
His democratic companion of Ohio, Mary Kaptur affirmed: the measurements it pressed the same ones that are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Magazine of press of the area of German speech 
The group of right hand is intact, only that inside the proper group the most conscious electorate turned - Der Spiegel affirms on the weak electoral result of the CSU in Baviera. 
Haider and his followers are ready to govern in Austria to prevent a coalition rojinegro. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the electronic edition of the German magazine of left side Franz Walter, in his titled article " The Revolution of Baviera devours his parents " he analyzes the motives of the dramatic defeat of the CSU. 
According to the well-known political expert, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had assumed his charge. 
The socialcristianos during several decades were developing Baviera - and now exactly these modern citizens are those who give him the back. 
The change of an age is at the same time a problem of the whole Christian democracy, this way also of Angela Merkel. 
The defeat was not completely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday finished a process that was already foreseen for almost ten years: it eliminated the indisputable hegemony of a party of state. 
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47,7 per cent, for the first time below 50 per cent from the fifties. 
This repeated itself three years ago, in the elections of the Bundestag of 2005, that is to say still during such a mentioned age of Stoiber. 
The reason of it is the consistent modernization of the CSU in the province devourer of his ancestors. 
The sociologists already 40 years ago have predicting this, but in the rhythm they were wrong very much. Nevertheless, the secularization, the results of the education and the establishment of the Germans of the North in the developed regions of Baviera had his negative consequences on the loyalty of the electorate of the CSU. 
With the modernization the possibilities increase also and it equally has political consequences. 
The group of right hand is intact, only that inside the proper group the most conscious electorate, more critics turned and more stubborn. 
It is surprising that in the last weeks exactly the conventional groups of the citizens were those who removed more of the CSU; the autonomous ones, the small industrialists, which have baccalaureate and the qualified ones. 
This way recudi� at least of 40 per cent the support to the CSU. 
Die Presse (diepresse.com)

J�r�ka: It is necessary to break the vicious circle of the poverty and of the segregation 
Today the European Summit has begun in Paris for the Equality of Opportunities, his host is France that this year is also a president of shift of the European Union. 
L�via J�r�ka, delegated of the European People's Party for the Fidesz, in his message directed to the plenary meeting, as one of the principal orators of this professional meeting, attracted attention about the segregation in the education, because it is one of the most serious violations that flog the gypsy children and also it is also the biggest obstacle before the prevale foundation of his interests. 
This conference of high level was inaugurated - on behalf of the French presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, the French minister of employment and social matters and by Vladimir Spidla, European responsible commissioner by the employments, social matters and of equality of opportunities. 
There were present at the meeting representatives of the governments, social European speakers and representatives of the most important European organizations of protection of the social rights. 
J�r�ka - according to the bureau of press of the group of deputies of the Fidesz in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to the discrimination in the employment, the gypsies stay out of the labour market first of all for his low level of schooling. 
" Most of the gypsy young people has not finished the eduacation secondary and due to the bad quality of the basic education, only an insignificant part can obtain university diploma ". 
J�r�ka stood out except that the education, like fundamental human right, has a determinant role in the prevale foundation of other human rights also. 
The investment in the education of the gypsy children to an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member states of the European Union. 
According to the Euro MP, it is a necessary concientizar widely these questions both between the gypsies and between not gypsies. 
Since while earlier a gypsy student begins the school, more possibilities it will have to turn into an active member of the labour market; across the taxes to the revenue and of consumption they also will contribute to the national budget. 
" As citizens of the European Union, the right is necessary to assure the gypsies for a quality education and to guarantee the abolition of the segregated education and of low level " - L�via J�r�ka stood out. 
According to the Euro MP, the unit is necessary objetiva and it activates of the European Union to accelerate immediately the processes of desegregaci�n student, for that there performs fundamental importance the correct fulfillment of the antidiscriminatory existing and planned instructions. 
" It is necessary to break the vicious circle of the poverty, the segregation and the unemployment, it is necessary to offer to the gypsy children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they could contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of right plenary meetings " - J�r�ka demanded. 
The target of the European Summit for the organized Equality of Opportunities annually from the Berlin meeting of last year that was celebrated in the sign of the " European Year of the Equality of Opportunities ", is to assure a singular forum to promote the abolition of the discrimination and the equality of opportunities at European level and at national level of the Member states. 
CSU: grace for a transitory period 
At the end of October a decision will be taken about the luck of the unsuccessful duo Huber-Beckstein 
In spite of the serious electoral defeat, heads still have not been cut in the tops of the Bavarian CSU, for the time being the debate has been postponed on personal questions. 
Erwin Huber, president of the party and G�nther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in his positions, but it is not known till when the grace will last. 
The luck of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 per cent, will be decided in the extraordinary congress of the party that will celebrate last weekend of October. 
The members of such a criticized duo allowed to make out: they do not stick so much to his positions. 
With it they were trying to calm the furious members of his parliamentary group and of his base organization, who one day after " tsunami Bavarian " demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority. 
Five years ago - although under the guidance of Edmund Stoiber who was in the top of his career - the union socialcristiana reached 60,7 per cent, on the other hand now, one year after the blow attested against Stoiber, they obtained only 43,4 per cent. 
The CSU for 46 years had " monopoly " in Baviera that gives 18 per cent of the German GNP. 
Although in the province of the South, of key importance for the Hungarian economy, the conservatives keep on prevailing, in the future undoubtedly they will have to do coalition with someone. 
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, the vice-president Horst Seehofer, the federal minister of agriculture, one of Huber's possible successors, also has a position in the limited group of intelligence that initiates negotiations with the liberal FDP and with the Free Electorate of right hand on a possible governmental coalition in Munich. 
The strange of the destination is that in the list of the Free Electorate there enters the parliament that one Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was made use for the blow of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then they erased cruelly from the stage to the ambitious local politics. 
The leading maxima of the CSU are investing now all his energies to stabilize Beckstein. 
In the transition an active role Stoiber will receive also that till now was moving the ropes in the fund, the ex-boss of provincial government and ancient president of the CSU qualified on September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career. 
On Monday Huber did some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they had deserved much more support of the party I join. 
Other politicians of the CSU interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and for proper Angela Merkel also. 
After the elections of September, 2009 of the Bundestag, Merkel will not be able to be a chancellor if they are not capable of heightening together the CSU that redeemed a transcendental role in the successes of the national elections of 2005. 
According to Merkel that with difficulty could conceal his disappointment for the defeat, the losses of the CSU will not reverberate negatively on the big Berlin coalition. 
Which naturally is relative: it will not be easier to treat the hurt CSU and the crisis of the social democrats continues. 
The SPD with his 18,6 per cent reached his worst result from 1946 in Baviera. 
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0 
After the Sundays elections, there will be no deputy opponent in the parliament bielorruso. 
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and the stability that it guarantees in the country Alexandr Lukashenko, on the other hand according to the Organization for the Security and the Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather with the violations of the law committed during the count of the votes. 
The OSCE that he sent 450 observers proceeding from 43 countries, he did not admit the electoral result. 
Although the term of the country of 10 million inhabitants, integrated per cent and ten deputies, more than one decade ago has no opposition, before the yesterday elections the opposition joined under the name of Democratic Close Forces (ODSZ) was hoping that Lukashenko, which for the fourth time renewed his order after the elections of 2006 of doubtful legitimacy, for consequence of the modification of the Constitution this time would "allow" the entry of some deputies of the opposition in the parliament. 
This way the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that originally it wanted to do. 
At the bottom of the expectations of the opposition it was that Belorussia, which every time depends more economically on Russia - that took a credit to moderate the import of natural gas increasingly face of Russia and that contributed to the selling to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipeline who happens for the country - wanted to improve his relations with the European Union, which does not give him permission of entry to Lukashenko and to other politicians of high level for having a political considered undemocratic diet. 
It was a sign of distension when the OSCE, on having evaluated the electoral campaign, placed emphasis rather on the positive phenomena and not on the errors - as for example the prohibition of informing tax to a third of the candidates of the opposition. 
Nevertheless the primary Monday report of the OSCE criticized even the proper campaign - in which the candidates of the opposition could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the count of the votes. 
With all this in opinion of the opposition one feels an improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners stayed at freedom and Minsk is arranged to a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of Osetia of the South and Abhasia of Georgia, although Russia - with which Belorussia theoretically constitutes a federal State - already for one month he considers two regions as independent. 
- We have given two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has begun between Belorussia and the European Union - declared to our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich. 
According to the candidate of the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006 it is desirable to support this situation, although " the diet is afraid to allow the entry of so at least an opponent in this parliament without weight ". 
The opposition does not glide to organize declarations of protest on having seen the results, rather his message tries to make to come to the electorate on the need to do economic reforms. 
- Clear this causes to us many problems because we must print the press of the opposition in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before his distribution, but even like that I see that every time they are more those who support the change between the biggest of age also - Milinkevich said, doing allusion to which to the diet of Lukashenko, who believes that his principal result is the creation of the social safety, it is considered to be suitable by not even the pensioners, which officially are most subsidized by the diet. 
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase of the trade deficit, question of time is only the decomposition of the social safety that " it looks alike to the silence of the cemeteries " - Milinkevich thought. 
The Russian observers unlike the politician of the opposition qualified of democratic to the elections. 
Serguei Lebedev, chief of the mission of the Community of Independent States declared to the Russian agency of news Novosti Ria: " the people do not believe in the words but in the facts ", so that the absence of the opposition is not another thing than the testimony of the ripeness of the electorate bielorrusos. 
Brunetta: " Of now in more it has been for breakfast before starting working " 
It has never happened in the History of Palace Chigi that they were putting automatic doors to control the entry and the exit of the personnel. 
but from today it begins with this measurement against whom it records and later he goes away to the bar to drink a coffee in schedule of work. 
This innovation has been presented today by the minister of the Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the General Secretary of the presidency of the Advice, Mauro Masi. 
" The automatic doors - Brunetta says - they are an instrument to work better, with major productiveness, more he attends and more services " the minister is necessary. 
" Now there is opened a new period of responsibility and of transparence. 
This is Reformismo ", underlines again Brunetta. 
With Palace Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Advice. 
For Masi " the election of the automatic doors is important also from the symbolic point of view ". 
One has not found resistance on the part of the employees, makes sure the General Secretary: " it has been a change shared by the workpeople and there was the collaboration on behalf of the same ones ". 
Finally, not more I have breakfast in schedule of work; not more coffee and medialunas. 
Word of Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, " a good Capuchin at 7 a.m. is a holy hand ". 
During a convention in the Top school of the Public Administration 
of Rome, the minister declares that " in three months the absences by illnesses of the civil servants have been reduced of 50 %, wants to say 60 thousand more persons to the work in one year ". 
And he adds that it is necessary to produce more effective the Public Administration 
Italian, " which wage dynamics? does the minister explain? in the last 8-10 years they have been double with regard to the private sector and good at the top of the taso of inflation ". 
For the time being millions of civil servants have joined to be opposed to the norms of the decree Brunetta adhering to the request supported by the Codacons. 
" While the minister of the Public Function shows the numbers, the minor absenteeism of work for causes of illness? does he write the affiliation of consummating? the people of the ' vague workpeople ' is in continuo increase. 
They are million really in Italy the correct and productive employees of the public administration that have joined to declare war to the illegitimate norms of the decree ". 
In particular, in the Tar one will answer the exclusion of economic treatments added by illness owed because of service; the extension of the hourly strips in which there are realized the visits of medical control of the sick employee, and other aspects contained in the new dispositions wanted by the minister. 
Industrial accidents, Neapolitan: " Crucial prevention " 
Every day, in Italy, 2.500 accidents happen in the work, 3 persons die and 27 remain permanently disabled. 
For 2007, the information Inail confirms really that the white deaths have been approximately 1.200. 
Numbers that they bear witness to the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the principal causes of death and provokes almost the double of dead persons with regard to the murders. 
To attract attention of the institutions, social forces and means of information about this dramatic question, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy 58 � national day for the victims of the industrial accidents, institutionalized in the second Sunday of October. 
" The worrying information spread by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm crucial all that should be the question of the prevention in the work ", affirms the president of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, national Association mutilated and invalid by the work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of the state squeezes his " full appreciation for the constant associative determination in favor of the prevention in the place of work, of the protection of the disabled workpeople, of the assistance the families of the victims and of the sensitization of the public opinion ". 
" It has demonstrated, a 'basting', sincerely shared, face to tragedies that, for his dimensions, cause the clamor of the means and the participation of the public opinion, on the other hand the daily reality proposes to us dramatic cases even repeated in his dynamics ". 
Neapolitan does not hide that " there is without doubts a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in formation and in information. 
Important individual they take the numerous initiatives promoted in school ambience for a more direct capture of conscience on behalf of the young people who enter the world of the work. 
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to brake the alarm on the social gravity, to apply and to improve the legislative norms. 
On his part the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has underlined " as the phenomenon of the white deaths they constitute a social absolute emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes to all the institutions a determined determination to put urgently end ". 
" The information on the accidents in the work seems to indicate a light positive andamiento, but this does not remove that the number of the white deaths is equally impressive ", there has noticed the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
" We do not want, really, that this " tendency to the decrease " be translated in less attention, because it is exactly when the attention diminishes that it exploits the tragedy. 
" We believe that at general level should become still too small to confirm the phenomenon of the accidents and the remedy can be exercised across multiple actions. 
Are they necessary, to our criterion - it has highlighted Mercandelli? major control panel and examinations, but also a stronger intervention on the formation of the workpeople, and this from the world of the school ". 
" It serves a subsequent effort - he has added - for all that it concerns the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion. 
But it serves, topcoat, a major sense of responsibility on behalf of the employers with regard to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency ". 
Mercandelli has denounced " the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary tutelage foreseen for the victims of the work " and the " welfare derivation towards which the system is going in the last years ". 
" Is the target to return to the worker the guarantee of the insurance - has he added? because the luck of the one who has an accident does not have to depend on the gift arranged by the legislator every time ". 
Readership Mp3 down it accuses, they put to risk the audition 
To listen to music to high volume for a long period time using musical portable devices as the readership Mp3 can cause permanent injuries to the audition. 
It is all that recounts the European Commission, which in a bulletin spread in Bruxel quotes the opinion of the Scientific Commission of the sanitary emergent risk and recently identified (Csrseri) of the Ue, published today. 
" Of this scientific opinion? is it read in the note? it arises that 5-10 % of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with musical portable devices weekly for more than one hour a day having the device to high volume risks a permanent loss of the auditory capacity ". 
" The fact worries me that a this way tall number of young people who use often musical portable devices and cell phones at acoustic high level could ruin unconsciously his ears in irremediable way ", affirms Meglena Kuneva. 
" Of the scientific tests? it continues the responsibility Ue - emerges a clear risk and we must react rapidly. 
What it counts, is to sensitize the consummating ones and to produce this information of public domain. 
We have to re examine, also the existing systems of control in view of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and have the step with the new technology ". 
Bruxel had asked Independent Al Comit� Cient�fico of examining the problem, seeing the big use of musical portable devices and the increase of the number of young people exposed to the noise that that causes. 
" The scientists - does the executive Ue conclude? they confirm that it is a motive of worry and the European Commission now will examine together with to the member states and to the interested parts that measurements might adopt possibly to protect better the children and the adolescents of the exhibition to the noise proveniente of musical portable devices and related devices ". 
At present, there exists already a norm of European safety that limits to 100 dB the level of noise of the musical portable devices, but worry increases as the auditory damage that can derive from an excessive exhibition such sources of noise. 
It is possible to border of very much these damages resorting to solutions as the reduction of levels and of the time of exhibition to the noise. 
To his seeming, The Scientific Committee Ue does present to that the utilizadores of musical portable devices listen to high volume (more than 89 decibeles) music for only 5 hours a week they overcome the limit at present in force relatively the maximum noise withstood in the job. 
Those who listen to music in such conditions for more long periods, risk a permanent loss of the auditory capacity after a period of 5 years. 
It means that it affects 5-10 % of the utilizadores of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2,5 and 10 million persons in the Ue. 
Rome, Alemanno gives the route to the Commission for the future of the capital 
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the accounts will do. 
The calendar fixed by the Municipality is this and for the workpeople of the " Commission for the fututo of the capital of Rome ", that has been restored this morning in his new head office behind the Spa of Caracalla. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and others 49 components of the Commission will debate the principal points for Rome. 
As soon as the doors were closed in March, the meeting and the communal advice will evaluate analysis and projects, in way of presenting in June the strategic Piano for Rome with the " official roll " of the Municipality and of his manager Gianni Alemanno. 
" Is the Commission absolutely independent and it is represented by all the political, social and cultural ideas? does Alemanno tend to underline? It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the meeting and the town council, will be able later to be endorsed. 
There is no excess position of rolls, only the will to have a place where to prepare a big project for Rome. 
In March finished the works it will disappear, because this experience must have one finish precise storm. 
In June? does the manager announce? we will present the strategic plan using the made work of the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome ". 
There answers to whom it accuses the Commission of useless, since his reports are not binding, Alemanno: " Everything depends on the work that will be in grade realizing the Commission and of the quality of his proposals. 
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Commission Attali and since also I am sure in Rome, his contribution will be fundamental. 
Almost always the politics flattens itself in the ordinary management and in emergencies that back in return demonstrate.. 
We, on the contrary, want to look further away and in the long term, in a deeper futurology, working seriously to the development of Rome and to his future ". 
The manager of Rome tends to indicate except that " this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: an euro is absolutely free, not coastal to the Roman citizens and it will serve to make to take part and to reason the best minds that the capital squeezes ". 
For Alemanno, really, " it is necessary to take a strategic design as a reference, not enclosure not immobile, to allow our city to do an authentic jump of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking with unitary spirit to his future ". 
A future that, the manager of Rome needs " it will not limit itself only to the current communal limits but it was looking further away " not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and of his juridical state of Capital but " also considering the roll that Rome can and must unroll as Capital of Europe and of the Mediterranean ". 
Obama? The first president anti American. 
There has written a well-known American politician that he is interested in to spend for independent: " Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president. 
The first one was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the economy USA and pipe relate (as also today private citizen gives) with the enemy Islam ". 
They increase the attacks against Obama while one brings the date of the elections over. 
a lady of Miami has written in a Web: " This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama has a big face of stone: believe that it should gain the highest charge of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators! ". 
Actually they are attacks that they do not say very much; they are attacks clearly of racial nature and they do not answer to the question of the electorate: will he be a good president? And also the opinion polls are; they all say that Obama should win and with a good advantage. 
Also in this case there exists the one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain. 
A newspaper of the Mississippi, in the entrails of the south of the United States, he has written a publishing house: once in the cabin to vote we will know well whom the American patriot will give his vote. 
Salt a side of the American mentality had covered up to the last one. 
" Say what they should want, we will think later to where putting the cross, if on Obama or on McCain ". 
There are the people who swears: if it goes so far as to gain Obama, we will go away of America. 
sew never said earlier, that there seems almost true the success of the black candidate. 
Nevertheless in spite of, all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the democratic ones is George Bush. 
They have asked 1500 persons: which have been the errors committed by Bush during his order? 89 per cent have answered: Iraq. 
It changes America. 
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and they ordered her to house to kicks in the bottom. 
In Iraq they are 4500 the soldiers that the life and the Americans have lost have not been forced to do the suitcases. 
Equally, Iraq for the majority has been the foible of Bush. 
The one who will assume the position of George W will have an enormous duty that to unroll. 
It uses, the economic collapse makes to feel also for the journalists: in the newspapers it is a time of courts. Many give the fault to Internet, " murderess " of the printed role. 
Five hundred American journalists have been addressed by PEW Research Center on the state of his profession and of mental control for the future. 
Although, today the journalists are almost all pessimists on his future. 
Nevertheless, the journalists have not declared openly to feel less worried on the credibility. 
They do not feel isolated like once. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic destroyed model. 
Also cut them carried out in the room where the editors work to realize the newspaper, it is a big problem. 
It is a problem that must be resolved, according to the interviewed journalists, if it is not wanted that the traditional journalism as the majority of the public understands it diminishes substantially. 
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today on the American journalist. 
Six on ten journalists and executives are sure that the journalism at national this level following a wrong route. 
In the local field the executive group is 65 %. 
Form against emission. 
It is not difficult for the journalists to see where the web goes. 
The biggest publshing houses open to themselves a breach in Internet, for many seen as the "killer" of the printed letter. 
The " economic pressure " that the journalists warn has increased up to 79 %. 
500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are embracing the technology in the hope " that does something of good " for the journalism. 
Is the biggest break today in the American journalism between whom it directs the newspapers? or the directors? and the journalists who work for them. 
56 % of the executives at national level is sure that his journalists share the same values, while at local level the percentage fall to 23 %. 
For some this has to see with the " safety of the work ". 
The executives who think to lose the job in 3 years are 47 % at national level. 
For the journalistic staff it is 30 %. 
That thing about the " sure work " at level staff (our editors, ndr) in America is always to the agenda. 
Only 13 % of the journalists works with a contract. 
In an immense nation as the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and million newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet the employers often offer what they want and it turns this way into a question of " take it or leave it ". 
The directors receive almost always good wages, while the editors can win up to 10 thousand dollars a month, more the retirement and the social securing. 
For the vacation, the reasoning becomes complicated: a whole of days the first year, other after the third one to come to 15 finished days after a certain number of years. 
But the American journalists, for his admission, "fall ill" continued during the year. 
It is quite a question of climate. 
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA SE QUEDA EN GROTTAFERRATA 
The president of the second penal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to push back the instance of real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move of his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome. 
Coppola is investigated by bankruptcy in the ambience of the investigation on against agreement relative to the climb Unipol-Bnl. 
In the course of the process of arrest to his charge, last week, it has obtained the home liberation, transforming into obligatory residence Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate one to be able to cover the route of the city of the province up to a room of the capital. 
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm has given the opposite vote) would allow him to influence his society and to gain access to the tests that accuse it. 
The elites in danger 
The phenomenon had already demonstrated some days behind with the vote of the camera of the representatives against the plan of salvation for 700 million dollars started by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this one, more interested to punishing Wall Street than to saving the economy. 
It gives us one New York Times of yesterday confirms informing us that the current crisis is disarming the Republican party always more divided between his old soul of the East coast, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions and to the business community, and his new soul, on the other hand, conservative, hostile to " those of Washington � and to the world of the finance, fortresses topcoat in the states of the Center and of the South. 
The soul, in fact, that has turned powerfully with the vote about whom he was speaking at first. 
This scarcely said is alone an example of the mutations, of big mutations, which the economic current earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the Occident and not only here only. 
Be in the United States as in Europe for time the crisis seems to work as accelerator of phenomena of incubation that with the new climate harden and go out to the light. 
The first one of these phenomena is the re update, the extraordinary revival, of the double category state - sovereignty in relation to a type of re nationalization of the economy. 
The crisis, really, is a crisis of banking houses - he would finance which have, if, you would finance strong relations with the exterior, but topcoat there are compromised much more the balances of the families that live in the only country and in a been only one. 
The one that creates immediately a political problem for the one who governs it: that is to say how to answer to the difficulty and to the protests of those persons and of those families that, on the other hand it is electorate. 
The crisis turns out to be economically world but it is politically and exclusively national. 
The political internationalism seems substantially out of game or they do not have very much to say: the crucial test is The European Union that divided like between the different interests and the different state strategies does not always reach to decide any politics together. 
It is from the government of every state that they they all expect for an intervention, plans of rescue and of revival, of new rules and topcoat the subsidy of funds: from the moment that goes over to the court there is alone the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of resources to finance you to remedy the things. 
And they possess also the necessary means and the legitimization to use them: two resources of incalculable value, value in certain circumstances in which any market probably and no organization will be able to have in the same measurement ever. 
This piece of news emphasis that the crisis puts on the state - nation is in perfect tuning, with the biggest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a very allied factor to this element: the territoriality. 
Paradoxically, while we were always sure to have entered the network of the more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial one, while we were sure that the global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will have on the other hand that to do the accounts increasingly with the slightly immaterial things as the water, the cultures and the oil. 
All things that, notice, can be truly transported of a place to other of the ground but they are equally joined in absolute way in a limited space, a territory. 
So the one who is like sovereign, it possesses certainly great more letters with regard to whom it it is not, and to whom it has the misfortune of living in a position without farmings, without oil and without water. 
I come to the second innovation that but a break presages. 
The one who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership. 
In this sense the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena. 
On the one hand the conscience objetiva of the need of one leadership, the request of someone that can take in hand the situation. 
On the other hand a wave of discredit for the leaderships existing, of economic relieved species inadequate with many dark zones. 
And together slightly deeper and in a certain worrying sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire leading class of the countries of the Occident in an increasing number. 
It always seems to advance more, in diverse places of the population, the conviction that before his actions they are the same that those of the social elites till now in heyday, the same way of feeling and of being, his culture in the comprehensive exception of the termine, to have done the proper time and to be stranger to the opinions of the majority. 
The demand of leadership, briefly, feeds subterr�neamente a branched but powerful movement of deslegitimaci�n of the leading classes and of the political traditional structures, which demonstrate in an electoral "riot" or in the sudden changes of collective humors of the latter times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social - democratic consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American men of the congress against Bush (and you geld also with the victory of the right hand in Italy that has something that to see). 
It has the impression that the traditional elites, his parties, his programs, but also his rites, his newspapers, his accredited intellectuals, his format would say someone, always do more make difficult to understanding and then to representing, what from today that is taking form they are the deep strata of the western society and that the economic crisis renews, it increases and waves potentially in excessive. 
Straight ahead to all this to speak about a " rebellion of masses � nowadays is frankly exaggerated. 
But to have the eyes opened truly it is not. 
The super glue to walk on the walls 
To conquer the gravity laws thanks to a super glue and in a future to walk on the walls as the man scratches. 
It is the target of several American centers of investigation and now a team of four institutes has approached enough. 
With an adhesive of only 2,5 square centimetres the scientists could have had a body of 100 kilos beaten on a vertical wall. 
THE STUDY? The American magazine Science Technology has published the discoveries of some investigators of the University of Dayton, of Akron, of Georgia Institute of and of Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material invented by the investigators' team is an evolution of the existing ones that use a particular structure of the carbon, called nanopipes of carbon. 
� The beginning of the glue can be imagined as a series of pipes arranged as a battery of spaghetti � there explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology de Atlanta. 
The scientists have been inspired to the paw of the gecos, covered with microscopic hair that can assure to the animal a perfect adhesion. 
The test done on different materials, as the glass, teflon and role of sandpaper, they have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful of the paws of this reptile and at the same time " it becomes alienated easily from the walls " he explains Liming Dai, investigator of authorizes of Engineering of the University of Dayton. 
TO WALK ALONG THE WALLS? - " This material might be useful as transitory adhesive " Liming Dai adds. 
Layers to walk along the walls exactly like does the man scratch? You geld yes, but the investigators think to a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because the nanopipes of carbon are drivers of heat and of electrical current. 
Other applications might have that to see with the aerospace engineering. 
For the time being nothing of superheroes. 
ANOTHER INVESTIGATION - Also Berkeley's University, in California, is devoting itself to the search of a new adhesive. 
In an article of the magazine American Chemical Society, the Californian students have presented a made adhesive of micro fibers as hairs that clean car of the dust during the movement on a surface always to support a perfect adhesion. 
Medicines: never with juice of fruit 
Attention to the juice of grapefruit, to that of orange and to that of apple. 
You are drunk, perfect especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich of vitamins, if they take contemporary with some medicines his absorption falters amplifying or diminishing according to the case, the efficiency with serious consequences for the health. 
To repeating the risk of the juices of fruits, they are packed that fresh air associated with the assumption of some medicinal David Bailey, teacher of the University of Western Ontario in London, that from 236esimo meeting national of American Chemical current Society to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: it is enough a glass of juice of grapefruit, of orange and of apple to reduce the absorbimiento of some medicines, annulling the charitable effects and putting to risk the health of the patients. 
The juice of grapefruit was already a low state it accuses because there was retained person in charge of increasing at poisonous levels some medicinal anti arr�tmicos, antibiotics, ansiol�ticos, antihistam�nicos and neurological. 
MEDICINES TO RISKS? The same Italian agency of the medicine had given the news in a bulletin of informations two years behind alarming doctors and patients not to subestimate the danger that was deriving from this one miscellany and to put attention to thing it is drunk in the case a medicine is assumed as for example to Diasepam or the Metadone. 
NOT ONLY THE GRAPEFRUIT? According to the experts also the juice of orange and that of apple they contain substances that inhibit the medicines. 
A long list of the active inhibited beginning for the grapefruit and other juices. 
Of here the call of Michele Carruba, the director of the department of pharmacology of the state University of Milan: " These discoveries in general it comes indicated to different agencies of the international medicine and nationals that possibly they provide to changing the informative notes of the same one. 
That's why it is always necessary to read the illustrative leaflets of the medicinal ones that are assumed and if there is something that we have not left clear, to to allow us to impress, to ask clearly the doctor or the pharmacist � was underlined by the expert of the agency Ansa. 
The New one of economy to Paul Krugman 
The Nobel Prize of economy has been assigned to the American Paul Krugman by his studies, his models of commerce and on the location of the economic activities. 
Krugman, 55 years, is a Keynesian neo that it teaches to the University of Princeton and is a well-known editorialista of New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the decisions of the administration of Bush as for the economy and the exterior politics. 
A few months after the offence of September 11, 2001, in these days che was breaking Enron, Krugman had foreseen in a publishing house published by New York Times that the second event would be more determinant than the first one, in termines of consequence for the United States. 
A forecast that unleashed a lot of polemic and that several years came reproached to the economy, but that now has been revealed exact. 
� I am surprised and a little annoying for as the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and of Worldcom they have disappeared rapidly of the attention of the public �, it had declared Krugman to I died of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the central European banking, Krugman is a " economist of big value �, but also a popularizer with a style " very aggressively, particularly critically against the excesses of the liberalism of the administration of Bush �. 
Open Office, echo the third edition of the bundle "anti-Microsoft" 
It is the day of the throwing of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productiveness that looks to always attracting more utilizadores, from the house to the office to the profesionistas of the public administration, as free alternative to the acquaintance Microsoft Office. 
After a work of almost one year on behalf of the voluntary developers, of whom his backs are watched by SUN Microsystem, new Open Office it appears to the public with several innovations: to the screen of welcome and to the interface the least rude magazine, more consistent others join, as the compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac YOU the Xth and the support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last standard version ISO. 
Attention put also to the multi functioning with the suite Office 2007, Open Office is in grade of opening the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). 
Interesting some specific functions of some modules as that one that allows to reduce the dimension of the presentation of PowerPoint, useful for example, electronic relay sends route, or the possibility of importing the file PDF in the module of graphic making, preserving the original aspect of the page. 
On this front there can always be created documents " hybrid PDF ", which accumulate the typical graph of the format of Adobe with the elements of a sheet of calculation or of the elaborating one of text. 
The Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements inside the aplicativos: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in diverse users, avoiding the conflicts of you modify, in the making of texts, a color comes to every collaborator given in the comment for a better recognition in the phase of review. 
Some companies are working also to take some functions of OpenOffice to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the next weeks they should give the definitive result. 
The version in Italian can unburden oneself in the direction http: // it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and I add to English that one was finding in the mirror from Friday. 
Except that for Windows and Mac YOU, as normally the suite it is also available for the operating system Linux. 
To order the cd of installation can be ordered also to house or to the work. 
And if the topic of the free one can be a hook for the diffusion in the houses, it is in ambience business that Open Office the suite tries, it tries the big bet, being able already to rely on with several projects realized in the public administration and in the schools. 
And there are absent not even the realities that offer a service of formation, consultations and of ideal assistance for the small and medium companies, in which they might open pilot of business. 
Open Office consists of five principal modules: Writer, for the video the correspondent of Word registers; Calc, is the spreadsheet that Excel replaces; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in case of the acquaintance Access it is the program that he withstands to being employed at the byline base; and finally Draw the graphic module. 
Target for 2008 is of coming to 5 million download, and thinking that up to today we come to almost already 3 million 600 thousand, with the exit of the new version it is probable that it is possible to overcome the due number. 
Also Kohl turns out to be positive it is the fourth case of doping 
New positive case in the tour of France: it is a question of Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the team Gerolsteiner, third classified and winner of the best rower of the climber. 
To giving the news, it is the place of the newspaper L'Equipe.

The analyses of the blood champions of Kohl enter between those carried out in the last weeks the laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If them against tests they confirm that it is positive, the Austrian one will lose the third position to the Tour and anger against two years of canonical disqualification. 
After the Epo of third generation confirms the news of the positive doping of Kohl to there is the chief of the French agency an antidoping, Pierre Bordry, who has declared Associated Press of having notified the news to the Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian one of 26 years there is posicionado in the podium to the backs of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and of the American Cadel Evans, being awarded the rower of the best climber. 
INMIGRANTES:NEW YORK STEAL I KNOW QUESTION, ITALY IS RACIST? 
Italy of emigrant's country has transformed only recently in a destination privileged for the immigrants " received with hostility. 
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a racists' nation? Racialism is what New York Times wonders in a long article who has dedicated to the debate about the topic in Italy departing from the case of the young man original Abdul William Guibre of Burkina Faso murdered the previous month in Milan for having stolen a box of cookies. 
This one married evidence what New York Times defines the " paradox of the north ": the north regions are at the same time those where they register " more integration and more work " but also the highest feeling anti-immigrants of the country and the tallest soporto of the North league ". 
As he confirms of the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants New York Steal he has quoted also the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
Also the new legislation wanted by the Lay sister presses the brake on the immigration and facilitates the expulsion of the clandestine ones it is quoted as paradigm of the cambiamiento of the climate in Italy. 
Pronounced tendency is for the Pope than for the president of the Republic: " Giorgio Napolitano finding Benedetto XVI in the Congress has asked the State and the church to work together to fight the racialism ". 
Students you of the expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room 
The market of the rents for the university students does not know the crisis. 
According to the last poll of the Sunia, the syndicate of the tenants, to rent a single room I could cost to a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome. 
" has the phenomenon already assumed very serious characteristics up to the point of excluding the right to study a big part of young people for the highest costs that the family would have to support? does the person in charge of the office explain studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani? in these cities the strong demand has completely deformed the market to such a point of unleashing a process of increase generalized even for the residents ". 
To part that in the majority of the cases the offers of rents contain a series of violations: contracts free type, not registered, without limit of canon, sub linked rents. 
For Sunia they are necessary extraordinary interventions that, across the review of the fiscal imposition, could regulate the prices. 
Looking in detail at the poll, we see that in Milan, for a bed in zone Brianza, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (zone Bande Nere) to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Wild animal) to a maximum of 900 (in zone Victory). 
In Florence a bed costs on average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700. 
In Bologna, where the students concentrate on the zones next to the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 for the individual one. 
In Rome in the central zones next to the University (the St Lawrence, Square Bologna) they ask you for approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room. 
Only value lightly more shallows (550 euros for a single room) for zones next to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt�). 
Economy does only if peripheral area changes: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in zone Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings. 
In Naples for a bed they serve you 300/450 euros, for a room Vomero and Colli Aminei wears out from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the zones Polyclinical. 
In Bari for a bed they serve you 250/350 euro, at least 350 for the individual one. 
in the cities more girls the prices are lower in termines absolute, but it has a major weight in the economy of the city. 
In the cities like in Perugia, where the phenomenon of the rents to students and extracommunity it is more frequent, a subsequent anomaly registers: an increase of 25/30 % of the canon to the foreign students with regard to the Italians. 
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historical rooms 
The cinematographic historical rooms close favoring the Multiplex. 
" A city without cinematographic rooms in a city blocks up, it is like a face without eyes ". 
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with effectively what is happening in the big urban Italian centers and also in the cities of province. 
The process of marginalizaci�n of the cinemas, which with the birth of big busybodies in the periphery and the consistent disappearance of the monkey you salt in the central zones of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a real cultural crime. 
To disappearing almost always, they are historical places, full of memory, " it is as if there was dying a friend, an acquaintance with whom there was shared a piece of place and so many emotion ", Observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the movie that twenty years ago behind there gained the prime Oscar and the big award of the jury to Cannes, which was counting the poetry of a room of cinema of province and the nostalgia for the way of living through the cinema that lost perhaps forever. 
The numbers given by the Anec, the principal affiliation of the merchants, speak skylight: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to paying most they are topcoats the rooms of the principal cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
Between the regions most suffered by the closings they are like first, Emilia-Roma�a with 82 cinemas less, continuing for Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
It is a demonstration that the person in charge of his disappearance is the agreement of the multiplex, these three Italian regions are proper that busybodies have made register the biggest number of new cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 is in Tuscany than in Emilia-Roma�a. 
" The Italian exercise has developed irrationally " is observed by him Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, " it would be useful that new structures were constructed but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of already existing those, because when a room of city closes, not all his frequenters are ready to the busybodies be transferred. 
For not speaking about the absence of funds in favor of the merchants: the previous debt of the state is of approximately 10 millions of euros. 
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist. 
To support the sector it would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year �. 
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried by the closings, there decided to repair with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first one of this type in Italy to promote and tutelary the pretty cinema salts be in the historical center than in the periphery. 
Between the due norms they exist come up of fiscal simplification in favor of the agents and advantages for the public in termines of mobility: the spectators will be able to enter the zone of limited traffic and will have special tariffs for the parking. 
� It is an initiative that I like � Giuseppe Tornatore observes " and I hope that other cities should follow the lead of Bologna putting in foot other measurements. 
It is true, that for contrasta the extra power of the busybodies, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of the sound and of the image because the public today is more demanding. 
The defense of the traditional cinema is a topic that for me was always important: the closing of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my infancy and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to realizing the " New cinema Paradiso ", which he was already thinking for 10 years. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I go on ahead to the Rialto or to the Quirinale of route already closed Nazionale, where I have lived so many shared emotions, for not to see the cartels blackened by the dust, I turn myself for another side �. 
Bond between politics and ' ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested 
" The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniformar the elections of the Municipality for interested to the cosca Piromalli ". 
They are weighed you accuse them that the magistrates of the Direction give antimafia of Calabria to the manager and to the vice manager of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the manager of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia affiliation. 
Arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the mediating elder between the clan and the public administration, and his pleaded grandson, namesake of the boss, already condemned for criminal mafia affiliation and to indemnifying 10 million euros. 
" Despising any juridical and moral norm, and of good sense ", write the attorneys, two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli. 
" Would it have been allowed to the mafia family? the judges write - of bringing in officially the intern of the municipality facilitating the big possibility of the control and of command of the public administration ". 
The president of the regional meeting Calabrian Agazio Loiero does not hide that " agreements between the bad organized life there is a heap " in his region: " There are zones where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable. 
But there are so many local politicians who resist to the pressure of ' ndrangheta, heroes that it stays clean ". 
Arrested of this morning they add to those of last July later that the police had announced the court of heads of the mafia family Piromalli. 
From the ends of last April, the town council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, already in 1991 and always for supposed condicionamientos between the organized delinquency and the local administration, the local politicians had been solevados of the order of administering the municipality. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, manager, of the Udc to the moment of the dissolution, after the voting to May, 2006, had been elect as chief of a right coalition of center. 
I exploit a scandal when the Prefecture arranged the dissolution of the town council. 
There called in cause the vice Secretary of the Interior who in this epoch was Marco Minniti, accusing it of having organized everything for a political question, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning tell that Piromalli even had gone so far as to ask for the change of the project of the highway A3. 
Of the interceptions ambi�ntales done to Dal Torrione, write the judges, it emerges " the availability to favor the requirements of a businessman, representative of a group very near to the clan Piromalli, uniformando the elections of the public administration on the interests of the mafia families ". 
When the energy is born of the waves, they lower to the stage the big ones 
It is an exterminated deposit that occupies more than 70 % of the surface of the planet and they are discovering it now, the big world companies of the energy. 
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they look at the big ones as Chevron. 
The possibility of collecting energy of the movements of the sea is studied for hundred years and in the 70s together with the first petroleum crisis, the investigations were intensified. 
When the low oil price, in 1980, the idea of making use of the marine energy was separated, but now when the cases of environment and the new increase of the oil give impulse to the sector. 
World Energy Council (WEC) of London has thought for 2007 that 15 per cent of the electrical world need might be covered by implants that exploit the movement of the waves of the sea. 
This quantity would be the double of the produced one at present for the nuclear power plants. 
And also the currents and the tides would be. 
Giants to the attack. 
The first company to bet on the marine energy has been Enersis, that 2005 has sealed an agreement to construct an implant in the North of Portugal. 
When the intention was announced it looked like a revolutionary step. 
At the distance of two years to betting on the marine energy, they are always more and between these companies those who have always voted for the traditional energy. 
" Is Chevron studying the technology on the oceanic energy? has he declared the spokesman of a company associated with the ha to the oil-bearing American colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal? and he is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us ". 
The cooperation in question is on the securing of a permission of the commission for the American energy, to realize a project to exploit the marine energy in Alaska. 
It is a quite important sign, if it is considered that in Alaska the USA continues to extracting oil and recently the president Bush has activated a plan to realize new perforations. 
In addition to Chevron it is Verdant Power Inc. de New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey following the way of the energy that comes from the sea, the whole invested till now, although they are not detailed they indicate an interest in increase. 
Technology to develop. 
The experts speak about a technology still to the beginning, because the marine energy is not you doubt that it has a big environmental impact. 
For the time being the impacts as those Portugueses or the Scots are of small dimension and they do not seem to create big problems to the ecosystem. 
To produce energy to long scale, it is necessary to use a technology with a major environmental impact. 
And the options are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas joined between them. 
The force of the waves, which makes move the boas up and down one turns into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders the intern of the same ones. 
The pressure makes to turn a turbine that in turn feeds a generator. 
The electricity is sent to the coast across submarine cables. 
For the time being four are the implants of this type in routes of development, to the waiting only from the federal approval, to part of the energy, it might serve to for a military installation. 
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a commercial center and for a parking, using submarine turbines in East River of New York. 
The movement of the water when there are tides, makes to turn the palettes of the turbines, creating a revolving movement that feeds the generator. 
Verdant has said that it has a clients' long cast in expectation of the necessary authorizations to use the energy. 
After the waves, the tides. 
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the development of the electrical energy, merita in this moment the potential of the tides. 
Although it is a question of an intermittent phenomenon, the tides are more prevenibles than the wind, the sun or the waves and that's why more reliable as source of energy. 
It is especially on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together to others that approach the coasts, have invested 7 million and a half dollars in 2008 and an investment of 35 millions is foreseen for 2009.
