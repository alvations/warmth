No freeing novel for Tymoshenko through the parliament
The Ukrainian parliament denied today the proposal to abolish in the frame of a novel of the punishment code that paragraph, on whose base the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted.
The delegates rejected the readjustment, that would have been able to smooth the way to the release of the arrested Expremierministerin, in the second reading of the proposal on mitigation of the punishments for economic offenses.
Timoshenko had been convicted in October because of the conclusion of a nominally disadvantageous contract with Russia over the purchase by natural gas to seven years custody.
The judgment is not is supposed to be negotiated yet legally valid, in December the calling of the convicted before court.
Timoshenko itself designates let arise the judgment as a political revenge of the regime and also in the west the process the suspicion of the prejudice of the court.
The proposal, paragraph 365, on whose base the Expremierministerin was convicted, to remove from the punishment code, was supported by 147 delegates.
226 voices would have been required to its acceptance.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan release battle or Libyan rebellions knows already its losers.
Muammar al Gaddafi lies bury at an unknown place in the desert and without it, the war is past.
Now the victors are to be defined only.
How it this region usually, win in the choices Islamists, the question is only, whom - the moderated or the radical.
The national transition advice acknowledged has the habit right of that of that one now with God a certain presentation.
Libya would become the country without crime, for for theft, one hoes in short the hand off.
Also women should forget thought at emancipation as quickly as possible, possible belief disloyal are executed, and so further.
Instead of a single dictator, the company becomes out of itself mutually feuding tribes future of the Koran geeint.
In short - in Libya an order will rule, that would be hardly desirable in this country hardly conceivable and above all.
Only - our lifestyle the only is not now once and objectively seen probably also not the best and would hardly fit change the mentioned Libyern.
So seen is it sooner taking aback that themselves the moslem fighters let help generally of the unbelieving dogs.
To its apology, probably only the fact likes to serve that the air attacks NATO was not led by any general from America, but rather by allah itself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The victors in Libya? The west does not belong in addition.
We took part only at a shot change, served got the interests of the Islams and our politicians rid of in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without that this would have brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq we saw rather of a military occupation Libyens.
Through it the local are happening a worry - same the expulsion of the cross drivers.
Get the mineral oil businesses the black gold to the mockery price however also without occupation?
Probably hardly and so the west can boast finally once with right of its unselfishness in things protection of the human rights.
If them these do not ruin that.

The menu of a fat addicted child: It does not eat breakfast and eats for supper sausage
Problems with excess weight have more than one-third of the children of 9 to 13 whereby 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children are overweight.
Current surveys proved - adipöse children come usually from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
So appears again once how important to the healthy development of a person the milieu is, in which he wake up and the examples are, that surround it.
On the tables of adipöser children, sausage products stand to the half more frequently on the table, than in families, in which of normal weight children live.
More than 19 percent the overweight children is on the day before had the clarification action under the motto "Adipositas no chance" fry for supper.
In families with Dickerchen, also sport is not concerns just among the favorite employments, what to be sure also the majority of the current students - only 15 percent answered that its parents of least are found once in the week time for active movement.
Inquire under 900 children
The survey took place were questioned past year toward the end of the school year, at the same time almost 900 children out of elementary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
That was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is no chance" that is supported by the general health insurance company and the company Unilever.
Previously more took student at the project than 12 thousands out of 4th and 8th classes part.
Unhealthy food and missing movement in the family are there decisive factors that are responsible for the frightening increasing number of children with excess weight or even obesity.
"Only the half of the questioned children led for example on, five times at the day, in the mode breakfast second breakfast-lunch-Vesper-supper to eat - one of the head prerequisites for a healthy nourishment", reads one of the poll results.
No breakfast and sausage for supper
Experts reprimand on that that also relative trifles are, how for example also the regular breakfast time of the family, important to the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however only 23 percent of the families of the student eat breakfast.
And - in most families every eats breakfast for itself alone.
Most badly the determination, that is not eaten breakfast in every tenth family at all, was.
The breakfast counts at the same time as a cornerstone of the healthy every day nourishment.
That inquired brought among other things at the day that one consumes in the families of overweight children much more often unhealthy fries.
And almost every - without consideration on the weight - drinks every day lemonades sweet (70 percent)
To be sure more drive do sport than 40 percent of the questioned children, but only less than the half of its parents that - namely only 15 percent.
Place you your own menu together
A further part of the survey enabled it selected children (204 boys and 172 girls out of 13 schools) to assemble itself out of offered possibilities after appetite and opinion its own menu.
", What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer as regards nourishment, far is removed of that ideally a healthy nourishment.
Under its favorite foods, many flour foods, meat courts were and naturally dessert.
"Alarming is above all the large popularity of sweet lemonades", is emphasized in the conclusion report to this survey.
In the lunch, therefore the entree, won dough ware tightly before poultry.
The children liked was legumes almost not at all and also the popularity of fish and vegetable courts as a lunch very slight.
Lame honor to the health
Simultaneously the survey showed however also that the children are thoroughly ready to change its eating habits if they get correct information.
"In the control group of the survey participant, that the questionnaire after conclusion of the enlightening presentation" Adipositas no chance is filled out", was to be indicated in many cases a clear postponement of the preferences there to principles of the healthy nourishment", is cited in the results of the project.
Obvious this was for example in the sweet Limos where many children began to give usual water the precedence.
The children marked in the questionnaire also much more often poultry or fish as an entree of the day and were ready to eat less dumpling or sweet foods.
Maintain pro - a stylist must be also a good psychologist
In the initiating article about how stylists learn, had moaned I a little that that was a little too much material for the beginning.
There I did not suspect in the slightest, what yet comes.
Presentations of three pros out of the industry, that garment of problematic figures and a seminar about how that runs "on the place".
It yet more badly should come.
The more closely the test moves, all more the more more information and practical tasks are forthcoming us.
But also if the course takes place every Saturdays and Sunday, it fully is covered nevertheless.
This time we debated with director Alena (at the course takes no single man part) how one dresses a woman, who has no ideally proportionate figure.
And those are nevertheless that of us.
The one have boy stick are a too short neck, the other one too figure without orderly curves and again others cozy.
It is the thing of the stylist to conceal wide shoulders optically, to extend the neck or the necessary curves do magic forth.
We got dresses also tips, like one a woman type such as Jennifer Lopez - therefore with large breast, wide hip and narrow waist - lovely and figure emphasized, without that it causes all too provokativ.
If for example the difference between waist and hips is so large, that the skirt or the pair of pants really does not fit, one should let himself at least a piece after measure tailors.
One not certainly will regret that, for well sitting clothing is simply prohibitively expensive.
In such a tailor-made skirt, one feels namely much better, than in one of the pole, that slips continually highly and, in the waist stands off, etc.
Jungenhafte figures can permit themselves again to carry garment with folds, billowing, applications, embroidery or Raffung.
In this quantity of information and figure types, I am happily that I have an entire week time let go myself all thoroughly through the head.
And nevertheless I have anxiety that it to is not to be created in view of the applied homework almost.
Each of the course participants got allotted namely a Promi, contrive should for the Outfits suitable it - day garment and evening gown.
At the same time we should consider the present appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I should "dress" Miranda Kerr, know that you possibly out of the campaign Victoria's it Secret.
In the interior, I rejoice, for that is for me personal much better to dress than for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, that increased recently probably at the hundred kilos, (well good, that is a little exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the garments out of periodicals or should seek on the Internet, print out and process subsequently graphic.
In the "Moodboard" how the entire result is named, should come then our entirely personal style and our relation to the graphic formation to the expression.
It is namely very important, also to think about the graphic side of the Stylings.
The stylist pulls the Models namely not only purely physically on, but rather also the so-called product site in the journals (after concrete specification, for example trend purses, coats, etc.) forms.
Therefrom told us the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But that first on Sunday.
That is that a stylist must have a good entire overview.
The Saturday presentation filled with information about figure types was spiced immediately by three visitors out of the industry:
Of the stylist Jan Pokorný, of the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and of the fashion photographer Ben.
Jakub remembered us that fashion illusion is and that should be a stylist able to exploit this.
And sent in stylist is able to do to work with a single garment piece on entirely different manner.
The magic word is named variability.
So one can lived carry for example a trenchcoat how over the jeans, therefore like a T Shirt or coat, one can carry it however also on the naked body, can dress paragraph shoes in addition and carry it as a dress.
It passes to roll up the sleeves or the collar and immediately the entire Look sees very differently from.
"Plays therewith", emphasized it.
Most came lain me however the following advice: "First perfectly must know" its the rules.
"First then may it it injure", said Jakub.
Finally becomes clearly why we must study all these theorems, what one with what combine can and why, also to me if one gets to see other in fashion journal frequently entirely.
Of fashion shows very to are quiet.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know now that a stylist must have prepared much more garment variants, than he in the end photographs.
Therefore one must be prepared for a Fashion story with ten sides (sprich ten Outfits) on that, at least fifteen to stylen.
And also, that the garment looks on the photo in combination with further accessory sometimes very differently, than in reality.
With all that, one must calculate therefore in the formation of the Outfits.
That image and Styl settle sometimes the half of the success, that confirmed us also Jan Pokorný.
There one needs himself only once madonna to look at a not exactly brilliant singer, out of whom image and marketing made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, one stands reserves the services of a stylist sooner vis-à-vis.
Also confessed consider personalities this frequently to be out thrown money (the essential matter is, that I something would bring, like I there would look is secondary).
And if already someone lets herself of us stylen, we should calculate therewith that it or it forces us with large probability an entirely other (smaller) size, when it or it needs in reality.
Then one needs subsequently only to googlen in order to assess with security that the popular press writes, the corresponding Promi would have again to or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday at the heart, to believe not that a stylist to focus himself only on the fashion and needs "to assemble" then the Outfit.
In its work, he must communicate above all with the people, must be that he stylt and he a crafty psychologist.
People estimate, stand without itself anzubiedern and to its opinion.
"If any manager orders us in order to sight its closet and in order to supplement pretty pieces, can clear and say we its not the entire closet - my God, that am yes terrible".
"One must at least a couple of things commendable find, to which one recommends, what one in addition carry can", says Mario.
It showed us also very concretely, what must include such a so named "place pocket".
Therefore so a pocket that one carries one at the waist zuknöpft and in that all necessary proprieties with itself.
Except such clear things, like scissors, Abroller to that hair distant or security needles it does not abstain also such utensils, like a nylon thread (therewith helps the stylist in the photographing of products, like purses or watching out of), special Clips, with which behind the clothing is snatched up, if it is to largely (pin or other clamps are prohibits, therewith the material broken goes) and naturally vicinity thing.
So that we however not only must listen, but rather also somewhat practically try can, learned we how one really lower glues shoes.
Also in the photographing in the studio where the floor is even, one can damage the sole, not to mention that outside.
O we glued and glued ourselves...
With the scissors, one may not touch the shoes once so that one does not damage it.
Therefore one must really sent advance.
Mario delighted me in that it praised my "creation" without restrictions.
The mentioned skill is namely not straight my strength.
All this was only the fraction of that what we got to hear in at the second Wochenend continuation course.
One clearly became in the meantime to me - on professional level to dedicate itself to the Styling, is no children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race diagonally through America
Review
The originally carefree trip becomes avoidable, amateurish mistake through a series totally the routine trip to the early layer.
It succeeded to be sure to fulfill the ambitions to a large degree, but what that utilizes already if obviously no one was in the mood to do a little more.
Already before it came on the counters, the new part woke expectations high with the subtitle "The Run".
It promised yet to shift the already aged game series "Need for Speed" again a piece into a new dimension and in the game cash demonstration examples, it seemed to be actually not only an of many Action race game.
We were also curious how the fit passages fall out, in which the head protagonist climbs out of the car and goes on on foot.
But how one it in NFS already accustomed is, is in the end effect of much differently when one had expected.
Certain - quite respectable arcades races are potential it, but altogether the game is lessened of some superfluous mistakes, are present that in this series more or less already a couple for year.
Therefore are it actual no more mistake, but rather sooner sign of an in principle inconceivable laziness the game developer.
The adventure begins very good.
First of all one is introduced into the story, whose principle figure has Jack certain problems of personal character; the single solution seems to be, to participate in an illegal race diagonally through America.
In San Francisco, therefore at the west coast, sits down one at the steering wheel - with the task of being firster in New York.
The reason idea includes an entire row of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided in ten stages and in more than fifty single races.
That means that each race is expedited on other stretch and that the single stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting milieu.
One has would offer no moment the impression, that game again and again the same.
Many environments yet are expressed in addition to look at lovely although the technical level of the graphics does not go out over that of the earlier parts of the series.
Therefore nothing Weltbewegendes.
But the trip through the desert, through autumnal landscape or highly above through deeply snow-covered landscape cause visually very comfortably.
There and again atypical elements bring a little change into the single races.
In the desert for example one is surprised of a desert storm, that strongly restricts the visibility.
In the mountains again one must pay attention infernal that one is not spilled by an avalanche.
Incidentally quite well sequentially the single races are incorporated.
Pass to be sure only a couple, but it.
One tries a while so to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), has one time to make up (classic race against the stop clock), expects one another personal duel with a single contractor.
And in addition also yet the police interferes, that wants to ruin one the entire thing.
Passages in which Jack leaves the vehicle are a novelty.
At the same time it concerns sooner certain interactive animations, in which Jack escapes before any someone and must help where it the players, in that he presses the correct button in the correct moment.
Therefore nothing complicated.
It surprised to be sure that it gives much in the game fewer such passage, than one expect would become (concrete probably only three).
In the end this is the thing sooner to the advantage, for so this element has at least no chance to become boringly - it belongs in the context to that above said to the elements, that more varied make the game.
The load model steps in the Fußtapfen of the previous parts.
That is, of current view point seen, tears it to be sure no trees from, on the other hand could one do not maintain, it would be bad.
He who seeks realistic simulation, must look around itself elsewhere.
The local load model becomes but an action loaded race load also further very well just although one could find better in the competition.
Until there, all in best order is so far.
Real problems emerge first after certain time.
In contrast to the load model, the collision model O. K is not entire.
Of a game of this type is to be expected hardly that it calculates complicated deformation and collision, but if one has practically before no impact on any an object premonition, how the car behaves, is obviously not all in order.
Typical example: In the narrow outdated or driving past "roves" accommodating car one at many places the other vehicle only easily, in other, almost identical situations comes one however into the hurling and turns wild pirouette.
Or goes the carts immediately to scrap.
Thanks to the remainder type system, that continues to be sure nothing from, from annoying is it always.
The remainder type are solved so: if one has total damage or lands far to one side of the stretch, throws one the game back at the last criterion of the stretch.
Only - in every race one has only five remainder types.
If one emptied it, all goes at the beginning loosely..
The remainder type are not therefore sooner something akin to a remedy, for the case that somewhat does not succeed, but thereon left should itself one rather.
Sometimes helps helps however not even the remainder type, there nothing other when the critical section out of the head to learn.
Expressed unpleasant is that the same things happen often at the same places.
One must pass through many curves for example on entirely specific type and manner, fits otherwise one simply not through.
Elsewhere one meets at the corresponding place of "civil" car always in same configuration, equal whether one comes firster or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
That is especially in situations annoying if one sees, that the contractor passes by before one playing at two accommodating car, but until one arrives even there, the vehicles are already in such a position that one must bypass or brake it.
And it is equal when one arrives there, everything is conceived namely so that it comes to this situation always thickly before your nose.
The contractors have even further advantages.
In the entire game, there is a couple of places where one is overtaken always at the same place by the same opponent and also here again without consideration on the moment.
At the displaced, this is to the conclusion of the game on the long bridge, that one happens in against direction.
The contractor must come overtake one here obviously on devil out.
And if it is then already once before one, it takes one naturally the visibility so that one goes there at the beginning the own car a couple of time in Klump.
Clearly - the game wants to make is one simply more exciting and more exciting however this intention so clear that it one quickly the joy in the game vermiest.
And that is a shame, for in spite of simpler load model, the game is altogether quite entertaining and in places also so aktionsgeladen that one knows almost no longer, where one the head stands.
And in principle is is equal, what "guilt" on that - the draft with fifty unique routes, that arrangement of the races in a manner that no boredom can arise, or somewhat entirely other...
An unusual idea is also the vehicle change in the course of the races.
One may not survey at the same time the gas station at the stretch, for just here one can change the car although in most cases the car suffices, that one just has.
The cars are subdivided in three categories.
The sports cars are suited well for the municipal areas, the strong American saloon cars for the straight freeways and exotic super sports cars for the technical trips, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game story goes also the tasks mode (challenges) - therefore the races in the single localities that one knows out of the story.
Here there are not only medals, but rather to win also experience points for the own profile, that is joint for the tasks (challenges) and the story.
In order to arrive at the higher driver level, different objects must be opened begun: by the car, up to the Backgrounds for the profile.
This is connected simultaneously with the Online function Autolog, that among other things the own obtained results with which other player compares and provides also for further collective functions.
A situation in the last race of the story is one of further incomprehensible blunders.
Here one comes namely with the car into an U-train-tunnel (on my account) where one long races (on my account) in the dark on the rails.
On the Tacho, figures between 150 a look comes 200 km/h (on my account), but there all at once of behind a SUBWAY and goes one uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorship, we will fight probably yet long about whether that was a Blackout of the game fashioners or whether the authors consider us to be so stupid.
The technical side is is nothing overwhelming however at least the visual overall impression in most cases quite impressively and here and there even brilliant.
More all the more annoyinger is that in some exciting moments the picture repetition frequency becomes itself slower and this sometimes rather dramatic.
That concerns however nominally the accidents with larger number of involving where one a continuous FPS utilizes anyway nothing.
The tone reproduction is so far O. K. and the Soundtrack is taste thing.
Address in the exertion to a scale possible as wide as only of rather young audience, emerged a Soundtrack a lá "by everyone something" - however who buys itself such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are mixed sooner.
If the game would not be lessened by the mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we would have been able to maintain with the breast tone of the conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in the last years.
But so the game causes somehow unfinished.
At for itself a class pleasure, but one should be prepared on that that one these mistakes with the Power of airport floodlight prick into the eyes.

EU ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the call of Negativisten and Euro skeptic
"The contract of Lisbon brought" the balance under the single institutions perceptible out of the Lot.
I would not have expected, flare up that such a hard war".
"It becomes five, six years last, until itself the wave smoothed and itself all at its new roll accustomed have become", began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador in the European Union, quite sharply its presentation at the juristic faculty.
How seriously it takes the motto "intelligibly and openly over Europe", it showed already in the first part of its presentation, in which it succeeded you to describe the single organs of the EU and its mutual relations on a such manageable and intelligible manner that it so many a lecturer of the juristic faculty of the Karl university can would have envy therefore.
Woman Vicenová praised at the same time also the new permanent chairperson of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"Originally criticism became would be loud, he inconspicuously - a gray official, who had not grown such a roll, but I must say, it has all the breath cunningly how well he took on the thing.
"It is a person who brings it ready to listen twenty-seven member countries patient, to communicate with them and the presentations clear above all therefrom has how it should go on with the EU.
The new position of the high representative for foreign matters and security policy explained it then as an answer to the question: Who is that actual - the European Union? Should which number I call"?, therefore as an important step to the unification and better legibilitys of the EU politics vis-à-vis countries, e.g. China or India.
No one wants to forbid us our Ölmützer Quargel
Woman Vicenová dedicated lived herself also the agenda, in accordance with that the European Union, lives and thought to live in the near future.
It designated the Czech chair of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the finance crisis and the gas crisis and would have arranged also the summit meeting for eastern partnership.
The case of the government during the chair designated it as a large Negativum, that strongly had damaged the image of the Czech republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has presently all hands fully to do.
With the words of the ambassador said, went it not only in the chair, but rather also in the subsequent crisis, that is overcome until today not yet, quite hectically to.
And there yet the seven-year-budget of the EU must be approved, what the thing makes just because of the current economic situation much complicated.
Whether it becomes a slim and thrifty budget, which branches of the economy receive precedence, which countries more and which fewer promoted become - all this stands now on the order of the day.
The ambassador reminds one also of its own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Intelligibly over Europe".
"If I somewhat do not like, are it grayish shorthand symbols, foreign words and specialty jargon that no one understands.
How I actually should know as a citizen whether one devises in Brussels really crooked or round cucumber and differently large bananas or whether actually someone wants to forbid us the Quargel.
It would have used the ground of the EU also gladly in addition in order to got more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of that two or different speeds in outlook
The Czechs in the call stand in the opinion of the EU ambassador, to be Euro skeptic, who perceive more the negative, than the positive sides of the thing.
More all the more annoyinger is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
On that many factors guilt are not, among other things also the restraint of our candidates whose inabilities to write, motivation letters and finally also the weak support of the Czech side.
Except the successful Czech chair, it lifted also the power and collaboration of the Visegrad group, that so-called. V4 forth.
"You believe me if a pole or Ungar to me comes and is a Slowake in the vicinity, mean the Frenchman next to me: "He, what sticks its there the heads together - is that already again your V4?" and there makes a rather sour countenance.
Woman according to Vicenové the EU in the future expect above all hard rules for the budget politics of the member countries.

"There will be more and more such institutions, runs out what in the end on a strong" Europe of the different speeds"", expects woman Vicenová.
In this regard, it lauded discussed will must also the roll of the Czech republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the execution of the principle, according to that all subjects with effect on the entire EU by all member countries and not only by the countries of the Eurozone.
Fire story:
The innovator IBM steps into the second century of its existence
If one wanted to search for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM characterizes most exactly, this would be well the word "longevity".
For the wide public, IBM is that synonymous for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern business although since its foundation already a century is slipped away.
The base to this longevity its first boss put already - that Thomas J visionary. Watson sen.
Already it represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems let easily solve themselves if the people were ready to think a little.
Its slogan "Think!" became so the trademark, around which life of the future giant should happen, (and simultaneously to the title of the proprietary periodical, that one in IBM already in 1935 to publish began).
This was also the base of the business culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us out of IBM this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle movement toward the future.
IBM survived and was also therefore an entire century successfully because it faithfully remained to its principles and back did not frighten before that to change all other all around.
That permitted us to transform in the course of our first century, the technologies, the business and also the company.
We hope, create that we in the next hundred years yet more", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the business out of occasion of the anniversary.
Thought out system
Watson operated already social care of its employed in the thirties years - in similar manner, like the entrepreneur in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had paid vacation, an insurance as one of the first American employed through the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as a work garment and a thought out remuneration system for best innovator and dealer.
Just as contrived are also the long-term relations of IBM with its customers.
The business was from the beginning brilliantly in the talent support - as one of the first firms worldwide lifted IBM each discrimination on - and accordingly was able to choose itself.
In harmony with this antidiscrimination strategy, also the present plan, the Palmisan is alternated becomes at the tip by IBM in the next year by a woman - of Virginia Rometty.
That is took in already thirty years in IBM there, previously it the position of the Vetriebs-, marketing boss and strategy boss.
IBM makes so-called Online brainstormings in the last years, out of which many future strategies and innovations maturely.
No wonder - there are is busied ideas enough, in the business almost a half million people.
An institution with good call
Your imperturbable position in the business guarantees the business a strong image and according to this interior and outward.
"From the beginning had IBM sooner the draft of an institution, than a bare technology business", said Economist the professor of the Harvard businesses School and the author of a beech over IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is no technology business, but rather a firm, the business problems with the help of of technologies solve helps", joined George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research thereto.
How the business itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be on the market only presently or to form it through this presence directly.
IBM - in because of the countries of its Logos informally "Big Blue" named, is grown up in a century to one of the largest businesses of the world.
It is one of the most multilateral technologies businesses generally - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation achievements in an incredible product width - from servers to there to the nano technology.
Of all technology business of American IBM possesses were priced most patents and already five of its colleagues with the Nobel Prize.
To its best known inventions, for example bank vending machines, credit cards, finance wap, stroke code or also the diskette belong.
With ca. IBM was 220 billions of dollar stock exchange value (market capitalization) this year the second largest technology business (same after Apple) whereby it overtook for the first time since 1996 Microsofts.
The view ahead
All products and innovations did not encounter the taste of the customers of today - unfortunately were for example the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the Online services Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, therefore may one itself not emotionally at the past bind", means in addition Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem to build its reason wall on different platforms - and if they do not function to leave it also again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft that in principle with its operating system Windows stands and falls.
Promising technologies
At the profits of IBM take part involve in largest mass of services, software and hardware itself to respectively one-fifth.
At the same time was represented yet 1990 hardware with a more than fifty percent share in the strongest.
Since 2000 IBM little profit sold invested assets throwing off in the value of 15 billion dollars, in which same time it however 58 billions of dollar of technologies seminal into the purchase.
In this Investionen, IBM continues also after 2008 when the modern finance crisis swept for the first time such as a storm over the world.
Also here IBM remained the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson faithful, that middle in the large world economic crisis its investment circumference increased.
Previously it seems that the business overcomes IBM the current crisis in spite of.
The value of the IBM shares increased since 2008 rockets-like around 120 percent and the net profit of the business are awake kontinuell.
The business slogan of IBM reads: everything can be changed - only the values not.
Also therefore may be expected that this flexible giant masters also the next crisis.
IBM story: Of the cheese tailor to universe flights
The company established one hundred years ago in New York IBM (internationally business Machines) had at the beginning a quite complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording corporation.
It received originally concerned the name IBM first 1924 - it a brand-name label for an agency in Canada and South America.
The fusion of four businesses, whose story go back into the 80 to years of the 19th century, put the cornerstone to the later company IBM.
They possessed technologies such as for example the famous Stechkartenuhren to the registration of the work start and -endes.
To the architect of this new business, Charles Ranlett Flint, that had also the chair in the supervisory board until 1930 in, became.
And it was Flint, that the boss of the rival company Thomas J. Watson adjusted so that it this helped in the direction of the business.
This Leader placed then even the founders of IBM in the shadow - on Watson's it ideas is based until today the invincible culture and identity of the business.
Watson led the business until 1952.
IBM, began how already the name betrays, with the manufacture and the sales and marketing of all possible machines for the trade - of sausage and cheese tailors, up to cash registers.
In the first four decades, in which Watson led the firm, it doubled its revenues on nine million dollars and the business expanded gradually on all continents.
Watson was for the firm so indispensable that it sat entire for forty years in the boss armchair, first then became it of its son, Thomas Watson junior removed.
Under whose direction IBM began to work at the development of artificial intelligence and developed also the first programming language.
In the '60's technician and computer of IBM of the NASA flights in that helped all to lead - to the mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of the person to the moon.
Meanwhile IBM in 1964 developed the first computer family with same computer architecture - the row IBM system/360.
A classic PC, that determined the computer standard of that time, came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
IBM later sold twenty years its computer production at the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand it bought however the consul aunt part of the business PricewaterhouseCoopers and climbed with this fully and entirely into the business with Consultingleistungen and services with high value-added on.
The strategy, that itself IBM in the last three years pays is the draft "Smarter planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies in smart manner in not yet once planned areas, for example also to the improvement of the situation in the traffic and in the city administration.
In the trade sector, IBM introduced recently the platforms "Smarter commerces", that should help the dealers to lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong story also in the Czech Republic.
IBM established already 1932 an agency in the at that time Czechoslovakia - as a generally first country in central Europe and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM operates among other things also a strategic Outsourcing center in Brünn.
The headquarters for central Europe and Eastern Europe settles in Prague and here is also a Top researcher team of world level that with the technology of the voice recognition is concerned.
Darina over its unfaithful spouse:
Iveta - you can retain this donkey yourself, want I it no longer!
Darina (53) says - now is end!
After its spouse Josef (53) of the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45) had become its lover, Darina remained still the hope that Josef awakes out of its pink dream and comes home.
But now it is finally with the patience past and for the further life, she sat down clear rules.
"Josef home can come, but no longer as my partner", explained D.
When Darina of the singer 1ST Bartošová in its own house refuge had offered, would have occurred its certainly not once in the dream how that goes out with its man.
When Iveta pulled on its pressing there after 30 days again from and back after, Josef went along equally.
Yes it confessed even publicly that it love it.
Gradually resigned Darina, yes it seemed even as if she wanted reconcile herself with its unfaithful man again - now however gave it finally the course passport to it.
it is equal, with whom his wife sleeps
If Iveta Bartošová in the future should leave yet, it is received home certainly not open arms.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to conclude its days in our joint home, will not chase away" I it.
"To be sure as a beloved, lost old donkey, but rather as a person, to the ties yet certain I would have", woman did not betray said already emotionally had separated herself it however also, it by it and insist alone on mutual decency.
The circumstance that it Darina locked the back door, carries would become Josef previously with.
I" respect "the decision my wife.
"I remain changes with Iveta together, on that nothing".
"My wife want to respect a paper marriage and that I".
"The firm continues, I attend to the repairs, the garden, the plot of land, I make the purchases".
"With Darina maintain I me very normally, only the bed divide we just not", said J. (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to seek itself a new love, it did not want prevent it on that.
"We do not sleep is me together, therefore equal whether it has a friend or who is that.
Is in love clearly that that is my guilt, I have me in Iveta and therefore accept I each responsibility to me.
The worst feminine vices: How stand it with you?
If one requests the men in addition to name some typical feminine vices, they shake without exception some promptly out of the sleeve.
Love women, you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we again happen let a couple Unsitten review, that let seethe the men the blood in the veins?
Purchase that which is sought
Does its spouse reproach them to be purchase addicted?
Must you weekly buy yourself at least a Hader?
Go you shopping gladly and may be it in actions also a little more?
Then it concerns in your trap probably really a weakness.
Many women are themselves its at least aware and try to hold its purchase desire half-way under control.
Does but hand on the heart, which woman it endure already to stroll in search of a well sitting outer clothing only so through a dress business and not to try itself immediately all (in all possible color combination) in the cabin?
Also if the shopping is for most women a hobby, for the men it is often the pure hell.
If they consider already said have yet once, like often it to its man - shelter you once rather outside...
Permanent discontent
Am I "not too thick"?
Would "I have to decrease at least five kilos - should I begin to make" to joggen or gymnastics?
Do I "please you generally"?
Does that occur them somehow well known?
Yes?
Then you belong possessed are probably also to the women, that regular therefrom how they look.
That is by far that you go letting should yourself, but many men react allergicly on that if its woman complains permanently over its appearance.
The stronger sex is itself united - with increasing frequency of the troubles are the women always more incompatible.
Order and neatness at first place
It is a battle against windmill.
Polish windows, wipe tiles and dust, scour the tub - and this at least twice in the week.
Do you scold with its partner because he tramples again once with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, you scold the children because the just scoured sink already again dirtily is and because the glass door has at the living room closet already again fingerprints, where yet the polishing so much effort makes?
If you should suffer from this type "Devianz", you should know that one may exaggerate nothing and the order and neatness in family life do not take precedence.
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can in the end also the mutual relations and above all the quiet in the family damage.
Sting el
"Dirty gymnastics pairs of pants come into the wash basket".
Do you "want to dress" the old socks really tomorrow yet once?
One does not throw "a wet towel simply on the floor".
If your partner of such a harangue is stopped, you may not be surprised that it that brings on the palm tree.
That is clear meant not bad, it want yet only, that of all its order has.
If the men knew this, the women needed possibly not so much to moan.
Clap and gossip
Many women claps and gossip gladly because becomes behind the back whispered or quite slanders or forges one alliances.
Women are focused now once on relations, therefore they comb gladly such subjects through, like for example - who where, with whom, like and why.
Probably each of us women has a clap little harmless and gossip in stock.
Hand on the heart - that is well own of all women.
That is not to be confused despise however with clap aunts of coarsest caliber, whom nothing and no one is holy, that probably every in its environment and represent that especially for woman collective a considerable danger.
Jágr and helped Philadelphia with its Assistenzen to the victory
The ice hockey striker Jaromír Jágr had in the Monday game of the NHL with two Assistenzen of large share in the 5:3-Sieg of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is hereby again most productive Czech player in the NHL.
Beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine nine and thirty-year ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, that another Assistenz added and was exclaimed to the best player of the Matches.
Also Jágr's indicated two Assistenzen in the same game it partner Jakub.
Jágr maintained after the game vis-à-vis journalist, he would have prophesies Giroux a large evening.
"Already before the game, I say to it that it today a Hattrick succeeds".
I had that somehow in the feeling".
"There and again come over one such a feeling", explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux obtained already a gate in the first shot of the Flyers.
A little late had also the second hit "a Czech trace".
Fought for behind the gate of the Hurricanes that packed and put it between the circles the successful Maxim Talbot before.
The home player Patrick Dwyer obtained a second before the Abpfiff of the first third a Short hand, but the second third belonged then again the Flyers.
Concretely Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr obtained it its third hit, after that Wayne Simmonds directed its shot to the fourth gate.
"I dear it to play" with it.
"I does not want to say, that he the best player of the league is, but certainly belongs he to the best three", lauded Jágr its centers.
Would not have occurred in life that I play to the conclusion of my career with such an ice hockey player together, like with it" to "me.
"That pleases me tremendously".
"I cut my game on I to".
"All the years in the NHL stood my partners its game on me on and now turns the spear around", smiled Jágr.
Carolina made game yet to the drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and again once Dwyer, that prevailed out of a punishment shot, it came on a gate up to.
Dully Read prevented however each further complication in which it was successful in majority two against one.
Acted Pronger "priced yet in our zone".
"It caught that packed, I took trip up and (Read) pulled to more distant post".
"I tried it to encounter and am happy, that it worked out has", described the last hit of the party from its viewpoint.
Through this victory, Philadelphia sat down at the tip of the eastern conference.
The Czech defense player of Montreal Jaroslav injured itself in the game against Buffalo and damaged in the second third because of an injury at the torso from.
The Candiens paid for learn Beck next to its also its leadership an unverloren in the Penalty shooting 2:3.
One of the punishment shots was not able to change Tomá Plekanec.
More than the lost points probably the high illness-related loss in the defensive hurt the trainer of the home team - the game played it only with five defense players to end.
"That is bad".
We played "the encounter only with a single learned player to end, the remainder were young players".
"But there lets itself do nothing make, therewith must we finished become", said Jacques Martin.
"In every change a wave of attack after the other and we nothing to oppose" had that.
"We would have more simply make the game and packed bring out must" that out of our third.
Here there were yet reserves", meant P. K. Subban, one of the defense players.
The Czech goalkeeper Pavelec defended thirty shots of Tampa Bay and contributed so authoritatively to the 5:2-Sieg over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, that concluded with this a series of five defeats, five different marksmen had share.
Development of the trip prices since 1989
Until 1989, it gave in the travel agency at that time only five allowed national: Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of sold at that time above all solely trips into the socialistic Eastern bloc countries, into the west might at that time only selected.
And so Czech tourists traveled at the Baltic Sea (into the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), into the Soviet Union (Sotschi on the peninsula rummaged at the black sea), to Bulgaria and Rumania at the black sea and to Hungary at the Balaton.
A light exception was the period of 1962 to 1972 when one was allowed to travel also to Yugoslavia, hit Yugoslavia a per western course and therefore the trips strongly were restricted to Yugoslavia.
A large paradoxically those socialistic times it was that it was not permitted once citizens of the Eastern bloc (therefore also the Tschechoslowaken) to travel in the frame of the socialistic countries freely.
If a citizen of that wanted to travel for example individually to Poland or quite into the Soviet Union, he did not need were in addition a so-called invitation letter, otherwise Individualreisen possible.
Already at that time the travel agencies also trips offered into the west, had to take one however gigantic snakes in purchase or spend the night also in the sleeping bag before the travel agency, and/or at least "good acquaintance" in the travel agency have.
Also so the thing had not run yet long.
That so-called. Foreign currency promise - the condition for a departure into the west - was given only "politically dependable" people - the other were allowed to travel not at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was would have been impossible namely no free exchange cash currency, without foreign currency promise it therefore to find the necessary finance means (western currency) for a trip into the west.
The from afar most Czechs of spent therefore its vacation in the inland, no wonder that the Czechs bought themselves chateaus innumerable and Datschen - a habit that lasts until today.
A trip revolution of the Czechs followed the samtenen revolution of 1989 on the foot.
While until 1989 a vacation in the GDR or in Bulgaria were the measure of all things, the Czechs in the past year 4.5 million of its foreign vacation spent into countries of the entire world.
A powerful paradoxically, whose one is aware himself today not at all more, the fact is that one was not able to travel into the presently most popular vacation country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of the at that time Yugoslavia.
Same of the start of the '90's of the past century at the foreign currency duty was canceled into the neighboring west european countries, what evoked a powerful wave of short visit above all to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken were not able to get long time of its trips into the west simply enough, everyone wanted to have been at least a couple of day there.
So the Czech vacationers slept in trips to Paris in the tent in the park, for who would have had at that time already the money for a lodging in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature in trips abroad of Czechs was at that time a with canned food, beer and hard sausage etc. of full thrilling trunk.
A further important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchange cash Czech crown - after decades finally freely were able to shop itself our tourists the western currency.
Our life level and hereby also the average salaries increased, what flowed 1997 into a further important moment.
Thanks to the increased demands after trips, the travel agencies began to prepare trips after 1997 regularly through charter flights by what means the flight trips to negotiate thanks to the possibility, bulk discounts, in comparison with the past incredibly reduced in price.
The Czechs had end of the '90's, with exception of the USA, already foreigncurrencyless payment traffic with all advanced countries of the world, what made the traveling even simpler.
To a further interesting moment in the story of the "postal service samtenen of" holiday traffic it came in 2000 when thanks to the high demand the first direct charter flight was dispatched into an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then annually direct charters airplanes with Czech passengers in far fly removed sunny countries; this year one flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations on.
At the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually into exotic countries!
A further important moment in the epoch, that our "postal service marked revolutionary" development, came in the year 2008.
On the 17th of November 2008, the visa duty canceled the USA for Czech tourists by what means our country joined definitively under the advanced countries of the world.
In 2008 spent the Czechs for the first time more than the half of its vacation abroad (50,3%) and for the first time in its story they gave inclusive of the costs for a single vacation stay at the vacation place more than 15 Tsd. CZK per head from.
The general meeting should find a new chairperson - again threatens a stalemate.
Already almost for five months, the Czech soccer has no chairperson and at the same time threatens that the successor will not be of Ivan Hašek at the tip of the Czech soccer association once after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday well known in Nymburk.
Until today, there is namely yet no unification about that, after which election regulation selected will should.
And without this, no voting is generally possible over the three potential successors.
Three interested parties would like to manage the Czech soccer - Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá Paclík.
In June Hašek of its function resigned whereby it had requested its colleagues in the retirement in addition to agree and to find a strong personality, that could lead the soccer in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek the old arguments between both association chambers broke out again, that cannot agree on a joint candidate.
This appeared plainly and clearly on the 16th of September when the new chairperson should be selected.
The delegated of the general meeting had come very for nothing into the people house in the citizen of Prague quarter Smíchov, for the negotiation led to no result and at the same time it concerned not only the choice itself.
One was able to agree namely not even about that, is who in the full collection actual stimmberechtigt - only the statutory representatives or also the functionaries equipped with an authority.
In this single point, one obtained at least partially unification why also the recommendation of the institute contributed for country and right, whose opinion would not be after a representation admissible on authority basis.
The disputes around the election regulation last however further.
Also the Exekutivausschuss brought no longer clarity into the thing, in whose sessions - equal, whether orderly or extraordinary - in principle generally does nothing stand other more on the order of the day.
Also if the views changed with regard to the choice a couple of time - the neuralgic point remained the same.
Does the question read: how one should advance in the 3rd round in order to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The issue concerns the question, whether one in agreement with the statute advance should, or whether an entirely other model found will must", placed you at Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairperson the firmly, that represents the pro soccer in the management.
According to statutory model, that candidate, who receives the larger prozentuelle support in the chamber, wins in the third round, for which he runs for office.
Mähren is nominally ready to go in on the compromise that that candidate wins, who receives the higher number of votes out of both chambers.
The Czech side again insists on the condition that the victor receives at least a two-thirds majority in this prozentuellen voice counting.
"Then have both preliminaries generally no sense more, this mode would become the entire bicameral draft in question place", understands Svoboda the objections of the mährischen side that it would find best, that thereto do not bend election regulation, but rather to select according to valid statute.
Surprisingly also Tomá Paclík agrees that, also if is outlined, that the statutory election regulation of all candidates comes at that soon probably contrary to Pelta.
It is "my wish that most extensive after the statute selected becomes".
"Therewith no absurd replacement variants contrived become, how in the last general meeting", declared of the owners (the soccer club) Victoria of that for the first time runs for office and delimited itself in its attitudes above all vis-à-vis Pelta.
Pelta remains however optimistic.
According to its opinion the new chairperson will be well known in Nymburk and believes he that the candidates in the future will collaborate also constructive.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the soccer EM at the current day would contribute" certainly to calming of the minds.
"If the soccer first on the euphoric wave rides, is also the readiness for the collaboration larger", means the functionary out of Jablonec, that of all three Adepten the largest experiences brings along, and this both on professional and regional level.
Rajchl is there more reserved.
"I hope for a unification, but the situation is unfortunately conflicting".
"That is no thing between the people out of bohemian and Mähren, but there are bend right certain efforts, the directions to own purposes""."
A renewed blockage "therefore is not excluded" in the general meeting.
"I hope however, that the healthy common sense in the end wins", said Rajchl.
Only - much time to the agreement of all sides remains no longer.
Some negotiations should happen nominally directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the Fußballgeneralität will be generally complete to the qualification game.
The charter airplane, with which among other things Dalibor and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, was able to start searched at the morning in Prague because of a technical interference not at all and so one feverishly for a replacement variant to bring a part of the executive committee like one yet yet at the venue of the bar rage away game.
In the end is then yet well the meeting on minister plain decisively, to which it should come nominally on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for school system, youth and body upbringing would have moved the split parties within the largest sport association of the country gladly to a unification.
Much stands namely on the game: national grants that Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech soccer and also the standing general meeting should the that the Czech sport after the finance problems of Sazka the new direction of wise.
Paclík goes into the fight for the position of the chairperson because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomá Paclík, that boss of the Pilsner soccer players would have been able to settle a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all its presentations over the new chairperson of the soccer association of the Czech republic, he would not have gotten involved at all with the fight for this top position.
"If there were a good applicant, I would fight for it and forgo" the choice.
"But in the present situation succeeded it not, such an Adepten to find", said Paclík.
The main reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Rajchl, is to be prevented it therefore that the alleged favorite of the choice, Pelta at which tip arrives the.
Paclík emphasizes also that it thought to exercise the function of the chairpeople in the case its victory only a year, therefore until 2013, to the appointment the general meeting orderly.
In the position of the chairperson, he would have learned seen gladly one Top manager, who is not entangled all too very into the soccer events.
"With some people coming in question, I personally spoke".
To believe "hardly that some said me, it did not want to identify itself presently with the Czech soccer.
"Such views gladly would have changed", led it on.
Most of everything, Paclík disturbs nominally the connection Pelta's it with the chairperson of the Pilsner of district soccer association novel Berbr, a man with controversial call, who counts behind the scenery as a powerful lobbyist, to influence with the capacity, Delegiertenabstimmungen on general meetings.
For Paclík, it is for this reason unacceptable that Pelta would have the position of the chairpeople in.
"In its victory, the current condition would be preserved on and in the Czech soccer, it would not go at all ahead".
"The support through Berbr, a clever Businessman, would get the soccer doubly badly", emphasized Paclík.
With this it alludes also on that that Pelta's it name fell some time ago in connection with Telefonabhörungen to the ascertainment in a corruption affaire, out of which Pelta followed however exempt.
"I does not know, which prestige a victory of Pelta that (tsch.) Soccer bring in should".
"And how would become we in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA stand there", said Paclík, that its earlier statement, "it would become the Pilsner soccer club sell, if Pelta chairperson would become", but already something calm sees.
If Paclík in the Thursday choice should win, he thoroughly could imagine however a future collaboration with Pelta.
Just as also a further candidate thinks - Rajchl, that Paclík had supported before the general meeting in October, that ended with a fiasco.
"It (Pelta) would be go would become" the first, that I.
"It has large capacities".
"I could introduce" me it well for example as a boss of the national team.
"But I do not believe that it is able, to lead" the association as a manager.
"I stick my nose yet not in matters, of which I would nothing understand", said Paclík, that had provided in September therewith for sensation, that it stood behind the recall of the arbitrator commission with Macela at the tip, that Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík itself maintains, it would feel grown the roll of the association chairpeople.
And has called at the same time on its capacities in the direction of private firms, for past summer is itself it also boss of Pilsen who celebrated with its support in May the first triumph in the league.
"I have the Power in addition to change something in the soccer milieu and to contribute" to one certain cultivation of this.
"Around the influence of certain interest groups to restrict, that in addition tend, disciplineed commissions and calling commissions to influence, what into repulsive situations degenerates", cited Paclík, that makes no Hehl out of its antipathy for example vis-à-vis the Sparta boss Daniel.
As one its priorities it would look at the establishment of the relations between that and the Czech Olympia committee, with whose aid it would become lobbyieren at the political tip politicians for that, that more money flows out of the lottery tax into the sport.
"That is one of the decisive things which the new chairperson should" dedicate itself.
"If it to the taxation of games of chance comes, how the political parties declare, grasp I its argumentation, must it however also plainly and clearly say, where the money goes", said it.
Its connection to the Pilsner club does not look at Paclík either as a Handicap although he himself emphasizes, the chairperson the would must "non-partisan" be.
Pelta again is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the citizen of Prague Dukla.
"That is not exactly ideal".
"It makes my opinion however also not much sense, my shares in the Pilsner club hypocritical on a third person to transmit, around after one and a half years again to return", placed Paclík clearly.
Pelta promised would exclude new statutes the the one stalemate situation in the future.
One of the candidates promised strongly would make itself two days before the general meeting of the soccer association for the Vorsitzendenamt, namely Miroslav Pelta, he in the case its choice for that that the new Statute gets, that in the future disputes exclude over the election regulation from the start.
The functionary out of Jablonec is the Thursday ago negotiation in Nymburk confident and believes, the campaign certainly would defuse itself in a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had promised already before the not realized choice in September, he wanted concentrate in the case its choice on the national team and the winning of finance means.
He decided liked to help first on the last moment to be involved in the choice before the last general meeting and so it the two-month recess to defend its presentations over the direction of the soccer and to introduce in a wider context.
"People on all levels dedicate themselves to the soccer, they are impatient and expect therefore that the chairperson will be" on Thursday well known.
"It feels that it is highest time, that the association is led by someone, means the man, who is connected above all with the Jablonecer club, that acted however also many years in Sparta and in the Exekutivausschuss.
Also therefore it means that it would control sufficient experiences in order to lead the Czech soccer.
It is convinced that for the current problems with the choice the euphoria is responsible, that at times of Ivan Hašek ruled.
"Unfortunately statutes were approved in the general meeting in June, were not so perfect that how it had supposed everyone.
If they had not permitted different interpretations, we would have had as of September already a chairperson", meant Pelta.
It used just the revision of the most important document of the citizen union as an enticement for the delegated.
I "should become chairperson, I take myself its personally on and am to bear ready personally responsibility if it out" does not work.
"That is a fundamental thing, without that it be not can", maintains Pelta.
In the further, he does not try to delimit himself vis-à-vis its contractors.
Already earlier it had announced, could imagine it a collaboration with Rajchl, that it acknowledges because of its juristic development and good knows it, that its against candidate would be its first representative.
It attacked also Tomá Paclík already long no longer, let that again no dry thread at Pelta.
In the soccer moved he herself already over a year and can refer already to certain successes".
"Its attacks were however reducing and many people were of its choice campaign shocked".
"Also therefore doubt now many its actual character", addressed Pelta its contractor, that would remain well faithful to its Proklamierungen, that it already in September expressed have.
According to its opinion its strongest weapon is the knowledge of the soccer of the lowest game classes, up to the national team.
And this should be the hallmark of Czech soccer.
"I would strive me also therefore to conclude all affaires - of the Causa Bohemians, up to the reverberations of the corruption scandal of the past year".
"Equally after that would become I me on negotiations with the private and national sector fall, around sufficient finance means for the entire soccer to guarantee", said the six and forty year old candidate two months ago.
At that time it promised also that its entrance would mean no personnel cleansings into the tip of the Czech soccer.
"I must me first once with the work contents of all employed trusted make", said it toward Strahov where based on the long anarchy understandably nervousness rules.
In spite of the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which accompany the standing general meeting, it believes that the delegated do not go to the Thursday for nothing to Nymburk.
"If actual the single debatable point should be, how one selects in the third round, let's come about that away".
"The soccer needs credibility and that wins it only through it back, if it finally a new Leader has", remains Pelta two days the possibly decisive day ago its functionary career optimistic.
Rajchl promises that that begins to work under it hard
If the previous deputy chairperson Rajchl should be selected on the general meeting on Thursday to the new chairperson of the soccer association of the Czech republic, this would become alleged many people in the association the mood vermiesen.
Rajchl promises namely that one would begin to work in the case its choice hard.
It wants to introduce system changes and responsibly wants to make the members of the executive committee for single soccer areas.
Moreover it promised to solve the case Bohemians, to improve the relations to the UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the soccer and to continue otherwise the work, that the prior presiding Ivan Hašek began.
"As chairperson, I would like to dedicate" myself the soccer as entire.
Begun of the international contacts to the UEFA and FIFA, over the national selection, the professional soccer, up to the achievement soccer for the youth".
"Therewith wants I do not say, that I all alone make wants", said Rajchl in the conversation for.
"I am a team player and would like to distribute therefore the competences in the Exekutivausschuss so that each member dedicates" herself one certain to area.
And I will distribute hard tasks, make headway so that the soccer in every segment with mile step".
About that many would not be charmed just because they to criticize, instead of only the work of other to work now even really hard begin must", joined it thereto.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the soccer movement had pulled in deliberation to not to run for office more at all.
"Of me is well known that I work" 20 hours at the day.
"But I must know, that it sense makes and that people behind me stand, that me not incessantly club between the legs throw and every step, that I make, in question place", said he as an explanation why he had hesitated.
"Many people said however that I would not be allowed to abandon, to me because it would become" do otherwise also others.
"That is confidence, that one do not lose may", said it.
Nominally motivates it also to be allowed to continue the work, that it began under Hašek.
"In two years, we mastered a large piece of work and not simply want to throw away" that I now.
"It became processes started, that probably not until a couple of years the validity come and I only unwillingly would see, that it someone stop", it meant and expresses with this its objections that for the case, that the other candidate would be selected himself - Miroslav Pelta, that could return situation into the times before Hašek.
"I believe is in systematic action and that somewhat, what does not bring" Mirek Pelta.
"Behind it, people who would make the soccer so stand above all, that he would be" selected only for there.
One can reproach probably a few things for me, but would be partial not, that I".
"I strive me, objectively to its".
"I wants soccer for everyone, because it then all well goes and not only that selected", noted Rajchl.
It contradicts also the statement, let it be only a chairperson of the Czechs.
"Also if many people maintain the opposite to do" I have really before, the optimum for Mähren.
"For example it is to be considered time whether one should not subdivide the league in a Czech and a mährischen part, whose winners climbed" then respectively into the first league.
"Then could it do not happen, that today only three mährische club in the league play, what especially for the young players in Mähren a problem is", means Rajchl.
Because now also the boss of the Pilsner club Tomá Paclík joined to the fight for the function of the chairperson, Rajchl does not trust itself to estimate its chances that he is selected.
"I perceive a strong support in the Czech chamber, that me to its deputy chairperson selected has and now recognizes, that clear successes behind me stand", cited Rajchl, that also the savings of hesitated millions crowns for unfavorable contracts, that looks at agreement of TV contracts and the negotiations around the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand he gives himself in part the guilt that the association does not pull at a single cord.
While it says of Pelta, "it would be from the start disqualifies, the Czech soccer to new confidence in to help", holds it the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate, who has to offer really something to the soccer.
"No one can question that it has" performed excellent work in Pilsen into only a year.
"Should it selected become, would become it probably the things continue, that Ivan Hašek initiated has and also the personnel occupation in the commissions would become it obviously not basically change".
It would not want to bend there the things certainly to its favor", judges Rajchl over its rival.
Pools most beautiful Europe
Leap into the blue
Of Julia Stanek
Splash basin in UFO optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: He who travels through Europe, can be experience blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike rest the tired legs in soda baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
If iris Meder in the past one and a half years went on investigation trip, one in its baggage was not allowed to be missing: its bathing suit.
Backwards on the water lying, looked it highly in skillful formed procuring, it swam toward marble Putten, that at the basin edge at it waited, and marveled over meticulously restored art nouveau floating halls.
If a bath pleased it, took it it flight into its notebook on - including interesting detail over the method of building and story of the building.
Architecture historian explored more than 200 swimming pools Meder in this manner - and she introduces now "bath joys" in its just appeared book: People floating halls in Munich, historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore Betonbauten" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, it led its "trip to the most extraordinary baths in central Europe" : Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, the Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Rumania, Poland - and respectively a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
A true bath culture enthusiast is the 46-year-old Germans.
With sport, it has not much at the hat, says Meder - only in the water would be that differently.
Annoying only that floating fans with blue tiles and chlorine stench must come to terms, while joggers can inhale the betörenden aroma of spruce forests or can listen cheerful bird twitter in the park.
"I have me one day asked, why swimming pools actually always so ugly its must", says the Meder living in Vienna.
I "therefore began to gather" beautiful baths.
Water surface doubles architecture
Geplätscher in the leap basin and ethereal saunas oils - the wellness factor in baths would be therefore so large because all senses are served, so Meder.
And if the builder effort gave itself, floating halls can be a true eye feast: "Instead of a floor, one has a water surface" in baths.
"You is on the one hand transparent, reflects on the other hand however the beauty of the entire building against".
Everything doubles itself optically: high vaults, colorful tile, leap boards.
The kleinformatige picture volume "bath joys" mediates interesting on 190 sides over the architecture story and culture story of historic wellnesses oases - makes however above all desire on a leap into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable copies in its investigations in Hungary.
Széchenyi bath of old next to grand well-being baths such as the 100 years in Budapest found it a nitrate containing waters in an urigen Karsthöhle (cave bath in Miskolc Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins with alkali containing water are filled and be in a bottle-shaped building, (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular outlooks on the other hand offer many heated outdoor swimming-pools in Switzerland and in Austria: While one has the entire city of the Züricher roof bath in mind, one can look in the outside pool of a bath in St. Anton at the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath, there is a window out of which one can observe the driving on the ski track.
The pool design most extraordinary perhaps expects bath guests in length field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO landed just in the Alps.
Out of three towards the top open scarves, it steams in the winter while in the background the mountains of the Ötztals jut into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
In every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder did not climb the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell stink after sulfur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it so strongly after heating oil, that one does hardly believe to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes of the alkali hydrogenkarbonathaltigen well-being water, that almost blackly is and whose ooze glues one at the skin, as soon as one can be glided into the basin - a wellness experience of the special type.
At a place, iris Meder was disappointed on its search for beautiful bath places however also: When it wanted to visit the freely bath and sun bath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, it found a closed off grounds.
Bath formed was closed that 1902 of the architect you at Jurkovic in the meantime.
As a Meder a view through that windows weathered knows threw the red--yellow art nouveau building, saw it how weeds proliferated between the tiles.
The decay worked against has one on the other hand in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the palace thermal in bath wild bath.
This bath has three building phases already behind itself; discover one cannot only neoromanische elements, that come from times of its erection in 1844, but rather also a maurische hall in the Alhambra style that was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization 1995 is the palaces thermal the favorite bath of the pool connoisseur iris Meder - and that not only because she comes originally from the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement, so different architectural styles to one so romp about unit to fuse", says Meder.
In such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is evidently only minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
German bank lets investigate raw material business
Of Christian Teevs
Does bank abandon the Germans its business with agricultural raw materials?
After MIRROR-ONLINE-information Josef field man delegated a team to test the consequences of the speculation for the arms of the world.
In January the group boss wants to draw then conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the German citizens, the thing is clear: 84 percent of the Germans do not find it according to a study acceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of the questioned demand quite that the Germans get off bank and other credit banks of this business, because it intensifies the problems of the arm of the world.
That is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report, that Foodwatch presented in the middle of October.
Therein the author Harald Schumann shows drive, that the bets at the global raw material stock exchanges the prices into the height - and carry the banks therefore a complicity at the worldwide hunger problem.
The campaign of the consumer protection groups is directed concretely at German-bank-boss Josef field man, also if large banks such as Goldman similarly act special it or Morgan Stanley.
Originally raw material bets were thought for that to protect dealer against price variations.
Yet meanwhile most experts are decoupled have themselves united, that the Zocker itself of offer and demand - and at the expense of arm make profit.
Unlike the US competitors field man reacted to the criticism: It promised to test the accusations and said, it would be no business "valued to set" the good call of the Germans bank on the game.
After information of SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international team tests presently the accusations out of the Foodwatch report.
Until end of the year, the test is supposed to be locked, are presented the results the board of directors of the Germans bank - including recommendation how therewith gone around will should.
At the end of January the tip of the bank wants to announce then, which consequences it pulls.
At the end, a reduction of the raw material business could stand, or even the complete departure.
Field man does handicrafts at its image
Foodwatch boss Thilo ground welcomed the message, strengthened however at the same time its criticism of the financial sector: "The betting on increasing prices of groceries shows damage" especially drastically, like ruthlessly banks today the common good.
Field man stands as an uppermost bank lobbyist now especially in the duty.
"The Germans bank must all plants out of its portfolio paint, with which money for bets on food prices used becomes", said ground.
"Equal whether it Mr. field man around hunger suffering people or around the call of the Germans bank goes".
The insight of field man comes is clear on the first view surprisingly, however that the group boss would like to deliver few months before its departure out of the office a perfect picture.
On Monday bank announced the Germans that the chief executive is not planned change unlike into the supervisory board.
With a departure of the disputed agricultural speculation, it could be improve image.
And around possible losses, he needs to shear himself hardly - therewith would have in the end its successor to do.
Every second would give notice raw material plants
Foodwatch strives, that pressure to hold on the manager highly.
Previously already more participated than 30,000 Internet users in the campaign of the organization.
On Tuesday published grounds the survey for which the institute Forsa questioned on that 7th and 8th of November 1001 people.
Just once eleven percent consider it accordingly to be legitimately that the Germans offers bank plants, with which on prices for food bet becomes.
Many bank customers would draw also personal conclusions if they learn, that its bank is involved in such businesses: Every second would give notice the survey according to all plants, with which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would dissuade acquaintance of such a bank to think 49 percent gave on, about that, to give notice its account and to change institute to one of other.
21 house in Vienna
The moved pavilion
Of Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architecture story with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Fair pavilion of Brussels 1958 obtained prices, became in Vienna the museum, stood empty and degenerated.
Now it will reopen as a display house.
If by more in more a more modern more manner post-war architecture is enthused, of clear forms, glass halls, courageous would swing and believe in are new building materials, that typical for that the technical progress, is the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl of tails for the Brüssler World Fair 1958 an appropriate and famous example.
Schwanzers pavilion got at that time the Grand Prix d' architecture for its easily and floating causing steel-glass-construction.
The building counts until today as a milestone of contemporary architecture.
It made the architect so well known that that constructed pavilion also in the next World Fair of Austria.
With its legendary BMW four cylinder house plus bowl-like next to building in Munich, it became 1973 in the end internationally famous.
Its as pavilion planned temporarily display building one had set up garden to the World Fair in the Swiss in the Viennese south railway station, had rebuilt and opens 1962 therein a museum of the 20th century - the "20 house" was named it.
Suited was the building however neither spatial and technical as museum - no walls to the hanging the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building has stood empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect rebuilt Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion, is named he now "21 house" and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening opens the museum Belvedere to which the house belongs, there the first display - a windfall in every regard.
Put through has Agnes Husslein Arco, that became 2007 new director the Austrian gallery Belvedere, the new beginning.
Husslein Arco, graduated art historian with notable career among other things in the youth as an Eiskunstläufererin, later in Sotheby's it, that Guggenheim museum and as a foundation director of the museum the Salzburg modern, put through the reconstruction emphatically with politicians and Denkmalschützern, it procured public means and private sponsor moneys and determined the utilization.
Except present art should be issued the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba by the of the same name foundation, should be a café and a bookshop there, and an office house had to be constructed in addition.
Severe supervision, small budget
For the execution, Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation.
Not only, because he rebuilt Joseph Olbrichs sec meal ion in Vienna sensitive, and expands and won had the competition, but rather because he studied in tails at the technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for it an "enormously important place", at which he had looked at "almost each weekend" the displays.
It knew the original design, and it knew the problems of the building that lost already in its transfer to Vienna and its repurposing at generosity and lightness.
In the present reconstruction, there were far larger problems: The building was "an energy sling", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were exchanged, were used optical fiber reinforced insulating glass and replaces the glass roof by special security glass.
Cold bridges steel girders were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos filled covers were rehabilitated.
Two first floors brought place for the new utilization, a layered light ditch between house and street provides for the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new construction, but still the easy tail pavilion.
The originals outside doors remained, that painted is house in the old reddish brown rustproofing shade.
And the movie theater hall is even yet very exactly so how it was earlier.
And that of all under severe supervision of the monument authority and with small budget.
"Often must a material found become, that well is and approve is and also the historical preservation office pleased", Krischanitz says and shows on a ruppigen ground in the first floor there.
In spite of all compulsions, problem and rebuilt is the building flexible and easy remained.
It would be difficult been with the pavilion, "that from Brussels came therefore", said Krischanitz recently, a typical „Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte".
So an architecture stands "always at the incorrect place" and wanted awake" nevertheless "a correct consciousness.
In this case, the 21 is not house however at the incorrect place, for a city structural windfall entered: Around the Swiss garden around just the "central station quarters" newly planned totally emerge, with office and dwellings.
And another windfall yet will enter perhaps: The 21 house could get strengthening of one other Krischanitz building, for the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought hears the Berliners temporarily art hall, and how one, negotiated it already with the city around a neighborly location in the Swiss garden.
Train plans winter-crises-package in million height
The train worked out a crisis plan, that should prevent train losses in the winter.
The colleague number is supposed to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the battle against winter contingent train losses and delays, train issues the Germans according to a newspaper report this year over 70 million Euro in addition.
The "pictures" -newspaper reported beforehand with reference to an internal crisis plan, until 2015 investments of altogether would be planned approximately 300 Million Euro.
Therewith a better availability should be reached by vehicles and rail network also in extreme weather.
Planned would be one Verdopplung the internal and external colleagues among other things for the snow removal on train plants and platforms on 16,000 people.
It would be yield goal, platforms to the business start and 90 percent of the betriebsnotwendigen to free within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago train boss had warned Rüdiger pit after a high-level meeting with government and industry against Zugausfällen and delays also in this winter.
In the past winter, the train in the passenger service had considerable problems because it lacks its among other things in difficult weather conditions at reserves.
So numerous new regional trains have waited for years for an allowance of the railroad federal bureau.
Moreover there is a delay in the extradition of ICE trains.
The train makes to create also for years that it must test let axes of ICE trains clearly more frequent in the workshop, after an ICE in the Cologne central station had an axis breach.
German bank pays million punishment in the USA
After the tumult around boss Josef field man new hardship comes out of the USA: The Germans bank a million penance must pay there.
As if the problems would not be home for the Germans bank already enough, also yet its past in the USA overtakes the industry giant now: That Frankfurt institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million Euro) in a comparison in order to enclose disputes because of the bankruptcy of five large union banks during the finance crisis.
It concerns the sale of mortgage paper.
The financial market regulator NCUA reproaches an entire row at large banks to have misled the union banks with incorrect promises to the purchase of the finance products; they would have deemphasized the risks.
Such papers lost during the finance crisis strongly at value and tore the banks with into the depth.
"We are satisfied, that we the subject solve could, without that the parties before court pull must", said a German-bank-speaker in New York.
The bank cleared no guilt with the comparison.
That applies also to the Citigroup, that promised to the payment of 20.5 million dollars.
The NCUA chairperson Debbie Matz welcomed the responsiveness both money houses.
That nationally Credit union administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US union banks and jumps in in bankruptcies in order to protect the customer enclosures.
The NCUA tries to get the emerged billion heavy damages replaced.
The now closed comparisons are the first of its type.
The regulator had itself also other large banks vorgeknöpft and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, that accuses Royal bank of Scotland and Goldman special it.
In that questionable mortgage paper it concerns so-called Mortgage backed Securities.
These stand behind house credit.
When the US real estate bubble 2007 burst, this became a multitude of finance firms the fate.
The US investment bank Lehman Brothers tipped over in September 2008, on the highpoint of the finance crisis,.
Also if the events are behind already some years, a sharp wind blows the banks in the USA presently toward.
Investors and regulatory agencies exerted innumerable complaints in order to received reparation or to punish mistake.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) released the largest complaint wave.
It reproaches overcharges 18 international large banks, the two national US Immobilienfinanzierer Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage businesses in the volume of approximately 200 billions dollar to have.
Also the Germans bank must stand a complaint of the FHFA, concerns here it several businesses in the value of altogether 14.2 billion dollars out of the years 2005 until 2007.
The regulatory agency demands that that straight line stand Frankfurt for "substantial losses" without naming to be sure an exact sum.
The Germans bank had the demands as untenable rejected and explains to want to defend itself.
Warren Buffett gets into with 10 billions in IBM
Finance guru Buffett invests strongly into the IT business IBM.
For March it bought up shares in the value of more than ten billion dollars.
Until now the large American investor Warren Buffett had explained always to not to invest in IT business and computer business because the long-term development of the firms only badly could be predicted.
Now it had read however the business reports of IBM and had changed its opinion over investments in the industry.
It already much earlier had to understand that IBM would offer above all services and would procure computer systems for the ITS departments of other businesses.
An Investment of Warren Buffett counts as a knightly accolade in the finance world.
Consequently the IT Urgestein IBM may name itself now "Sir IBM".
For Buffett revealed now in the US economy transmitter CNBC that it had bought for March IBM shares in the value of 10.7 billion dollars.
Its Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway climbed therewith to one of the largest stockholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that once IBM had not known until now something of the engagement.
It praised the management that had provided even in the economic crisis yet for orderly profits.
"You have one romp about job made", said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM has set for long time on the lucrative ITS services such as the business of computing centers.
Also software and consultation offers computer pioneers old the more than 100 years at as well as high-performance firm computers.
Buffett had avoided technology firms to date sooner.
It says, it would invest only in business, whose business it would understand also.
Instead Buffett take action about in a freight railroad, at a lubricant manufacturer or mechanical engineers.
Its holdings Berkshire Hathaway also share in of a whole series of large groups such as Coca Cola or the Munich possesses next to approximately 80 own subsidiaries re, that earlier Munich back.
The 81-year-old had received the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960er-Jahren and had expanded it with smart investments to one of the most valuable businesses of the world.
Nevertheless its lifestyle of modest is.
It is therefore for innumerable investors in the world a cult figure.
Its almost infallible sense for the Geldverdienen brought in it the nickname "oracle of Omaha".
After Bekanntwerden of the Buffett Investments, the IBM share vorbörslich climbed around one percent.
"Big Blue" how IBM is named also, more is at the stock exchange altogether than 220 billion dollars valued and is therewith together with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology businesses of the world.
With Microsoft, said Buffett, wanted it however do not get into.
Let founder Bill Gates be a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the disclosure of the "Zwickauer cell", Turkish media doubt the German constitutional state.
A newspaper speaks quite about one "bloody ideology" that would revive now again.
The murders at eight Turkish sturdy and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
On this message is reacted in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany with anxiety and worry.
For for many Germans Turks, an a long time dead believed ghost returns therewith: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in solo gene in May 1993 there were no comparable force with right-wing extremist background more against Turks.
That there is hostility towards foreigners in Germany, never stood nevertheless in question.
The uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals however sizes whose dimension is yet by far foreseeable.
Does the bloody ideology "live again on"? titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" on the other hand emphasizes that one of the culprits is supposed to have been a V man of the constitution protection, and appears provides that also German authorities could be involved into the radical right-wing swamp.
Prudently community Germany reacted the Turkish: It reminded one of the weekend with a warn watch before the Brandenburg Gate at the victims of racist force.
First two weeks before community in Berlin had thought the Turkish jointly with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.
In cheerful colors, living and working together had been produced - as a story of the success.
How a slap the reporting of some Turkish media causes there: The heading of an article in the Turkish Internet platform reads "Germany gift to the fiftieth" "Haber X" that the backgrounds of the murder series reports.
Also the Germany edition of the "Hürriyet" does not let itself take it to pull this intellectual connection.
"It catches on to stink", is named the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes therein that people had been murdered, who would have paid taxes and would have performed with its work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Extremely critically the action of the police and its late search success is discussed in German Turkish Internet forums.
Why it had not occurred already much sooner to the German authorities, to search in right-wing extremist circles for suspects, the authors are surprised.
Many one appears at least rhetorical to drastic means ready: "Here further is been sloppy, remains the migrant nothing other remaining as the self-defense and the armament".
Probably the best self-protection will be" "that.
"Of the goodness of the clarification and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network hangs very strongly the internal peace in Germany from", writes "selenium".
The attacks of Mölln and solo gene in the nineties clarified what means if the internal peace in Germany in danger is.
The photo of the fire ruins of solo gene deeply is anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turk living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and can flow the Germans, that mistrust and distance in right force.
The attacks sharpened however the we feeling on Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of the German politics was criticized at that time above all after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused, who to visit surviving of Mölln.
After the fire attack of solo gene, it sent a condolence telegram at the Turkish president of the state, let itself represent Klaus Kinkel on the funeral service in Cologne however of its Foreign Minister - Kinkel counted at that time in its speech up how many duties the local Turks performed.
Very so, as the value of a person calculates itself after the height of its tax duty.
The present reporting of the Turkish media shows again once how deep the mistrust of many German Turks is into the local rule of law since then.
Next to the efforts of an extensive clarification and reappraisal of the radical right-wing terrorism in Germany, it needs this times open words.
The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The adventurousest bank of Europe does not sit in Italy or France, but rather in Switzerland.
The UBS went in the finance crisis almost bankrupt and slides since then of a crisis in the next.
Now it should arrange a German.
So it not certainly had thought itself Axel weaver.
After its spectacular departure of the tip of the German Federal Bank was acquaintance become in July that it would begin 2013 a nearly just as spectacular new job: Supervisory board president of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel weaver was happy publicly, praised Switzerland whether its beauty and the UBS whether its newly won solidity and let fall friendly comments over the future colleagues.
"The UBS created" the Turnaround.
"I please me on the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
Yet already in September became clear that all would come very differently.
A dealer of the UBS in London had gone around all security systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billions of Euro verzockt.
UBS chief executive Oswald Grübel, a not only in Switzerland of praised bank, had to go.
The supervisory board president of the UBS counts since then also as struck - and ask everyone: When does Axel weaver come finally?
Already became well known that weaver may advise the bank of February 2012 at.
It receives and the supervisory board chair already in May - not first in 2013 how the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel weaver, that becomes hard.
It is no bank, rather economy professor and central banker and certainly compel would have had a training period.
With a blow, it accepts then the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, that proved just now once again, that it earns a long time the title scandal bank of Europe" "largest.
For the UBS is on the one hand tremendously - until recently was it the largest asset manager of the world - and has slid on the other hand for years of a scandal in the next.
Nothing, seems it, remains the once so proud Swiss bank saved.
It began in the finance crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent call.
The image of the concealed and solid, but also ausgebufften of Swiss asset manager it had combined with ambitious goals: It wanted to become an entirely large number also in the Investmentbanking.
So the UBS 2007 administered on the one hand more money of being able to do customers with 1.6 trillion dollar than each other bank of the world.
And on the other hand it was advanced as an investment bank into the league of the largest banks of the world.
That made impression.
The bank former and later long-time bank professors in Zurich Hans violinist tells: I placed" "my student the UBS at that time always as a pattern of a good bank.
"From current point of view one asks himself: How was I able to be mistaken only so"?
It was mistaken powerfully.
In 2007 became for the first time obvious that somewhat proper in the UBS sloping ran.
Middle of the year resigned chief executive Peter Wuffli surprisingly, that counted until there as more highly more intellectual and just as brilliant bank.
A few months later one suspected why it had gone.
The Investmentsparte of the bank had itself with verzockt Subprime paper and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder that, the UBS announced an increase in capital in height of would say and would write 13 billions of franc.
For that it found still would have actually investors, to be sure which, over that of many an until shortly before the nose gerümpft: an opaque Asian country fund from Singapore and an Arabic country fund that was concealed so, that one did not learn once its name.
Yet that was only the first blow.
It came in April 2008 more badly.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, supervisory board president Marcel Ospel, 2006 yet of that at the second-best paid supervisory board of Switzerland, stepped back.
The catastrophe followed in October 2008: The UBS stood in view of its misinvestment in the finance crisis before the breakdown and had to be rescued by the country.
The national bank bought the UBS for hesitated billions of problematic securities, the Swiss confederacy gave become could six billions of franc for a compulsion change loan, over that it co-owner of the bank.
The entire Switzerland was shaken - then it noted how dramatic it is for a small country, if it harbors so large banks.
In the end the balance sum of the UBS 2007 was more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphics).
"Once again could we the UBS do not rescue", says bank researcher violinist.
At the first catastrophe, the second joined.
Already few months on that capitulated the UBS in the tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of being able to do customers, that had defrauded if possible taxes by means of the bank.
Moreover it agreed a payment of 780 million dollars to - as a repayment of unjustified profits out of these businesses including punishment impact.
Therewith well known the UBS more or less openly to have helped in the tax evasion.
Simultaneously it lost been was something, that for time immemorial its capital in the competition around rich customers: the Nimbus of the discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss was bank secret no longer that.
The resignation of chief executive and supervisory board president followed it.
And the Exodus of customer moneys.
So the bank had lost its credibility in both central company divisions within less months: in the Investmentbanking through the false speculations and in the fortune administration through the aid to the tax evasion.
And straight as it again somewhat quieter became, thought just than one, would manage now the UBS it already again, follows there this unfortunate dealer story: A single dealer verzockt 1.7 billions of Euro before the bank notices, that somewhat sloping runs.
And it becomes obvious: With the risk management in the Investmentbanking, it does not work out obviously still.
"With the case Adoboli has one assess must, that itself the risk inspection too little changed has", says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the bank institute of the University of Zurich.
Also the head of finance of a large German bank is certain: "The problem of the UBS is that they has not" the risk inspection in the handle.
At the same time it had been yet exact the idea of the caution, with which the Swiss was begun bankers long time ago, to become hats of the large fortunes of the world: no all too large risks, for that security for the money - the world liked to collapse also on the far side of the Alps republic once.
The vaults of the Swiss banks had become landed the symbol for imperturbable reliability how and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich fits yet to the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
Already the situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters at the Züricher railway station street, that leads of the central station out of directly to Lake Zurich, that will frame of the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are splendid, the store rents belong to the highest in Europe.
One finds jeweler such as Tiffany's it here between Swiss tradition businesses such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss has resided here banks: of the national bank over the palace of the Credit Suisse up to elitist private banks such as Julius bear.
One enters the reception hall of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are marble disguised, stand before that thick leather armchairs, next to the bank Logo a large reference sign to the "safe".
The UBS knows, what the customer seeks here: Security.
Both Swiss displaced this idea of the Swiss bank large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, however sometime - or betray how the boss of a small Swiss finds private bank.
It would not like to read its name rather in the newspaper, makes in the end it, like all Swiss bankers, also with both large banks of businesses.
The UBS had become much too large, finds it - above all in the Investmentbanking where moreover the hinge Saxons would have spread out.
The Swiss would have there nothing more to say.
"And if yet, they adapted" itself a long time to the customs of the hinge Saxons.
Actually it was gave the Anglo-Saxon Investmentbanking that changed the UBS, its profits first high and then the debacle: No European financial institution lost so much money in the Subprime jungle like the Swiss large bank.
On the 15th of October 2008, the catastrophe became visible.
"At that Wednesday concluded the government coalition of the small seven million country the largest rescue operation in the story of its nation", writes the author Lukas Hässig in its book of "the UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billions of Euro of allowed the politicians in order to rescue the large bank standing before the bankruptcy.
How was it able to come in addition?
If one speaks with Swiss banks, they see the problem above all in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 merged themselves two of the three Swiss large banks to a powerful group.
A bank emerged was, that already in the fusion to largely for the small Switzerland - and always further grew.
At the same time helped that both different precursors banks of the UBS supplemented itself: one pass, but sleepy bank with the focal point fortune administration in Zurich and a poorer, but already more strongly internationalized.
Suddenly the internationalized investment banks came favorably at much money, with which they were able to turn a gigantic wheel.
Two names are connected with this ascent of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, of 2001 to 2007 group bosses of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, at that time chairperson of the supervisory board.
"I thought always, Wuffli and Ospel would be a dream team", says bank researcher Hans violinist.
"Wuffli, the Hochintellektuelle, modest, that much of models and statistics understands worked up here has" itself, and Ospel, the belly person, that of the bank scholar until very above.
But Ospel had depended to the end on Wuffli.
And Wuffli had made a decisive mistake at the end probably: "It thought, its models would be the reality", says violinist.
"That is a tragic case".
Tragically, perhaps.
Is clear: Insolence came before the case.
Colleagues of the UBS remember clearly the management Meetings, on which group boss Wuffli issued again and again the same slogan: Knock Goldman special it of the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the earth.
It cited the "League Tables", that results tables, that documented the success of the banks of that time.
There the UBS wanted, after very above.
Some steps already had succeeded its.
In the foreign currency business and in the share trade, it played very above.
Management consultants who were delegated emphasized however a weakness: In the international interest business, in the bank language "Fixed Income", would give it a powerful distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has spaces in American mortgage products.
In order to close this space, UBS proceeded into an adventure, that cost it almost the existence.
Hungrily after growth, invested both the bank itself and a before its established Hedgefonds into American Subprime plants.
It developed to a powerful machine, the securities on American mortgage credit packed and passed along - at the same time however also even risks retained.
When other banks sought a long time the exit.
"Yet in the summer 2007, when the American real-estate market in flames stood, has the UBS there bought", says bank expert violinist.
So largely the euphoria, so deeply the case.
A manager after the other had to go when the attempts fell out to clean up more hard than thought.
Posts in the UBS became the sling seat and are shaky until today.
He who leads the large bank now, has a nearly impossible job.
It must find a strategy for a bank, that all nearby business models are missing come.
Bank researcher violinist has already an idea: End with the Investmentbanking, concentration on the fortune administration, return to the Swiss roots.
Very so far the bank does not want to go to be sure (yet).
But the Investmentbanking strongly should shrink, so much is now already clear.
At the coming Thursday, the new bank boss Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to introduce its future strategy.
Italo Swiss old the 51 years was thought actually only as a temporary solution when the bank separated itself surprisingly by predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile he prevailed: It should lead durably the businesses of the UBS, divided the Züricher bank on Tuesday with.
Ermotti wants to cut back the investment bank on the state middle of the nineties.
It paints 3500 places.
That not however will pass.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
With what does it want to earn money?
Those are certain now already asks themselves the questions, that Axel weaver.
Publicly he says would seek himself until now only, he with his wife first once a dwelling in Zurich.
Next year.

Intelligent crows spread out in cities
In many places sowing crows count as a "problem birds" : Yet out of the cities, the highly intelligent animals can be banished by far more, maintain experts.
The one like would like to get rid of it, that others it very quickly: Crows have belonged for centuries to the cityscape, but in many communities, resident troubles heap themselves over dirt and noise of the animals.
At the same time a means against the "problem is birds" not yet in visibility.
Sowing crows would be to gotten out of the cities no longer, said experts in the first crow symposium in the east Frisian Leer.
There specialists prepared out of the entire federal territory over possible exits.
They seek alternative in the cities
Conservationists attributed at the same time the problems in cities also to the country flight of the especially protected sowing crows: The chemistry use in the agriculture destroys increasingly the traditional habitats.
The hunt, increasing development and that cases of typical brood trees made the birds life heavily.
Crows stand under environmental protection.
There are sowed large colonies with more than 600 brood couples among other things in the westphalian, in the northwest among other things in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen as well as in Leer.
There a disputed project to the abundant killing of crows in the district had provided 2005 for negative headline.
Critics had the catching of the animals in Vogelfallen and the killing with club as especially brutal designated.
"The normal expulsion, the frightening away, brings nothing", assessed the city plans and landscape plans Werner Klöver out of Leer.
Way inject nest with water or said trees fällen, would have often undesirable consequences, also the environment experts Manfred emperor out of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals of soft from, large colonies split itself and distribute itself at other places".
Let Vergrämung be only as an exception at hospitals, age homes or schools conceivably.
"We must live with them, we get it no longer away".
Without the surrounding countryside, the problem in the cities could not be solved, meant mayor Wolfgang waiter out of Leer.
Let a combination be conceivable out of frightening away of the animals out of sensitive living areas and curl offer in order to establish it at other places again.
"Information chalkboards instead of chain saws" the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta OF Maria Jürgen advertised on the other hand for a completely other contact with the animals: We can bear" "a pimple in the face in the end best self-confident.
Jürgen had established with the Ascheberger crow scholar path in Schleswig-Holstein, at which reference signs inform about life of the highly intelligent sowing crows.
The project would be supposed in the meantime already of tourist.
Also to the criticism of the noise of the birds, an own opinion had Jürgen: "There a lot of communication, that is have itself much to say".
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Sowing crows use not only remedy in order to come at a delicacy, but rather place its tool as a remedy even even here.
Behavior researchers of the university Cambridge tested recently at four sowing crows how far the intelligence of the birds passes.
In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that they must bring a scaffolding with stones to the collapse in order to arrive so at a moth larva.
Without much training of recognized it purposeful, which size and form must have a stone, in order let collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the smart crows had to solve then a kniffligeres problem.
In a vertically set up cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds were not able to reach its prey.
To be sure the researchers had left them wire pieces.
From that all four animals formed a hook, with whose aid it then the bucket at the handle out of the tube of fished.
This succeeded three of the four sowing crows even on attempt.

Massenschlachtung on a personal plain
Perceptively and generous Peter begins book new Englunds "beauty and frights. A story of the first world war, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of head people, that goes one too heart.
Here a tip, how one advance could: Cut out this side carefully and make it to your bookmark.
They will become acquainted with these people in Englunds romanhafter story very well. And these head people will function as your GPS when lighthouse in this few moments in which you are lost like Englunds men and women in the fog of the war and are robbed your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is moreover the new permanent secretary of the Swedish academy that determines the Nobel Prize for literature.
It wrote an unusual book, that it does not describe incorrect as an "a work of the Anti story".
It contains only few names large, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassador, racing reporters or discussions over tactic and equipment.
It is fewer a book about that what happened, explains it, but rather sooner "a book about, how it was". It is about "feelings, imprinting, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and frights" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, of schoolgirl and botanists up to mountain climber, physicians, ambulance driver and office employee.
Some of these people become heros.
Some become war prisoner, lose limb, will displace or die.
Each of these life flickers on like the Votivkerzen in a church, some come thereto while other extinguish.
Englunds book deviates from the usual history books.
It corrected had been moreover the presentation, the first world war only the devastating position war at the west front.
"Beauty and frights" hikes with expert view over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkan Peninsula, the east front, Mesopotamia, east Africa.
On the soldiers in this book, bee baskets fall celebrates, one Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an unsolvable problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war inundates life of these people such as a natural disaster how a hurricane Katrina that smells after Kordit.
Imagine, you are hears a woman who is with its children at home, and canon fire in the distance. Do you remain or seize the flight?
Who comes generally?
Hardly anyone understands, what is happened or is waged war why this generally.
"Missing facts", assesses Englund, "became with suppositions, acceptances, hopes, anxieties, quick ideas, conspiracy theories, dream, nightmares and rumors revamped".
"Beauty and frights" follows single people such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard stump, a young German ship sailor.
Your stories were taken main memories, letters and other already published material.
Your life reports can be frightening or seizing, but they are extremely living in Englunds of the aggregation losing in details of small moments.
Many of them are itself about deficiency and stopgaps.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, it tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement".
"Coffee substitute, incorrect aluminum, incorrect eraser, paper associations, wood buttons".
It tells more of the replacement meal in Germany.
It describes "meat that made out of pressed rice and in Hammelfett baked became (and finally with an incorrect bone out of wood served became), tobacco, that was made out of dried roots and dried potato scarves, shoes, that with wood sole were".
There was how it notes, "837 registered nourishment replacement means, that in the manufacture of sausage permits were, 511 registered coffee replacement means".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes its own pressure to the wildness and says over the war: "One feels that that is in spite of all that, what to sit planned was sooner for men than in the armchair, to do with the evening newspaper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in the hand, and so, as would mean such a facade civilization and as would give it no barbarism behind the own strengthened and covered shirt breast".
Reversed recognizes a British soldier that he probably die and no one would take therefrom notice or would be concerned therefore.
"If one of the thought, itself to sacrifice, distance takes, would like one think, that this before an audience happens", writes it.
Instead of its it is became" as terrible as "a convicted man, that in the secret hanged.
Other observations are about the old Europe, that falls apart, and over new types of the terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic contest", writes Englund, "a war between the factories".
It catches the arrival its, what it names "a new species in the Bestiarium of the yet young century" : Measure murderers turned and ideologically convinced "the words in the measure suit who slaughters while he sits" behind a desk.
People behave gives on unforeseen type and manner and it just as frivolous behavior such as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect itself at a prostitute with a venereal disease, in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression its can in the trade with Gonokokken pus discovers become, for soldiers bought and itself on its genital greased, in the hope, so into the hospital to come", writes he.
"That that really were doubted rubbed it into the eyes, what led in addition, that they were" blind the remainder of its life.
In this translation out of the Swedish of Peter Graves, Englunds poetry becomes pliant and yet unobtrusive and fits itself perfectly at its human task on.
In dozens of small scenes, it catches unleashed the type and manner, like the war "in unique manner uncontrollable powers: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hate".
The people begin to ask themselves why its leaders bring it for fighting.
The best books over the first world war were was usually sooner falsified like Paul Fussells "Great and modern memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques "in the west nothing new" as extensive history books.
Englunds volume joins an unorthodox renown hall.
Its book has devastating that end of which I read ever in a non-fiction book.
I yield it no longer.
But it is, would have snatched away us as it with its book this side with the head people before the nose and ignited with a match.
After an early false step a precisely more planned spread
Hundreds of police officer were involved on that, some of them carried use helmets.
One had decided on Monday night because to this time hardly people in the Zucotti park are.
The operation secretly was held and were informed only few officials high-ranking. Everyone others believed originally to participate in a practice.
Chief of police Raymond W. Kelly was middle under them and its presence unterstrich the fact that the operation of full challenges stuck.
The occurrences of the past weeks such as the use of pepper spray against protester, what violates the rules of the Dezernats and provided the squatters an enormous increase at public sympathies, were allowed to repeat itself no longer.
And so the police action became removing the protester out of the Zuccotti park after two weeks of the planning and training carried out.
Officials had prepared this in that they observed, how occupations were handled in other cities.
A catastrophe practice had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Iceland.
Officials reinforced to concentrate the so-called chaos training - measures to the terrorism fight, why also the fast transferring of a large number of police officers counts - around on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to take in into the park, came "in last minute", said someone who is command trusted with that, what kind of Deklarierung as a "practice" spoke.
"The few policemen, that my knowledge incorporated became, knew not, that it around the Zuccotti park went", said someone, that anonymously would like to remain.
"The only that knew that it concerned the Zuccotti park, were the high-ranking officials of the department".
A reason for the secrecy was a lesson that had learned the city.
On the 14th of October, officials wanted to clear the park, were awake then however back when hundreds of protester came together, after these had learned of these plans.
Officials of different police units were involved in the operation of the Tuesday, among other things also use commands out of the entire city - hundred shafts of mobile officials that are used normally in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that in the course of the day many people in the park go in and go out, almost like commuter so that 1 clock per night is a good moment in order to go in.
"It was appropriate, this to do, if itself the slightest number of people in the park delays", said it.
Rescue vehicles with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were available before the departure at the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in the vicinity of the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the beforehand recorded messages that roared out of the loudspeakers, seemed many protesters to intimidate.
When the public officials in its bright blue windjackets penetrated into the park, many protesters collected simply its things and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 clock no tents would be grasped in order to give the protester time, to pack its Hab and goods together.
Other teams of official were seen how they gathered in the environment in order to interfere, should become arrests in the park necessary.
Reporters were forced to left the park.
Paul J. Browne, speaker of the chief of police, said would be happen, this to its own securities.
But many journalists maintain that one wanted to hold off it therefrom to observe the police actions in the park. And they said, the contact of the official had been very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV vehicles in the Church streets would have been able to make photos at the west side of the park.
As itself the police toward west through the large disorder at personal things of the protester, among other things suitcase, art lawn and paper bags with dresses, moved, followed its employee of the city cleaning, that canceled, what had been put back.
Some protesters, that refused to go, were dragged after outside. Pictures hereof appeared already short time later on the Internet.
A head kernel of protester related position in the vicinity of the kitchen area of the warehouse in the center of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued its methodical arrests.
Approximately 10 people in the epicenter of the warehouse tied themselves to its arms together.
And two people chained themselves at trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Officials of the catastrophe protection were called, around it loose tailored.
How Mr. Kelly said, became until ca. 3:30 clock no arrests in the park carried out.
The clearance was locked after statements of the police after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
To most arrests, it came how it said, based on "improper conduct and resistance against an arrest".
The official most prominent on the spot was Joseph J. Esposito, the boss of the department, the official highest uniformed of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, department boss of the criminalists, was also there.
In spite of its presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead" "the operation" how Mr. Browne said.
For the case that they take action, waited a second group of official at the eastern side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar street.
In the Cortlandt streets, a street block north of the park, and in the Pine streets, a block further south, were erected barricade.
It could be observed how by these locations out of the police the vicinity always further around the Zuccotti park around expanded.
At a place was observed how several officials, many of them with protection sign, people drove after outside.
Approximately 28 people were in the northern vicinity.
Some of the violentest actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Shortly before 5 o'clock a protester on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators burst let the air south of the Pine streets out of the tire of a police penance.
At a place, the quantity of a piece threw barrier wood.
At the end, an official and a protester came into the hospital.
Labor union of the caregivers will submit because of releases complaint against the city
The labor union that represents hundreds of school caregivers, that lost past month its job, plans to accuse the city on Wednesday because the releases would not be based on its unsuitable influence on the schools, that poor students instruct, necessary and discriminating.
The complaint is yet openly stands probable the last possibility, that the labor union, district advice 37, in its efforts, the releases to make annulled.
Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig school helper, care coordinators and other colleagues, who had lost its work to the most badly paid employees of the city of belonged and on the 7th of October in a gambit that labor union leaders described as a political revenge for that, that one had denied in the past year of the city the access to a health foundation that the teams maintained,, with which the budgetary loophole should be closed.
This accusation were rejected of the authorities categorical.
On a hearing of the city advice, Dennis M said. Walcott, director of the schools, in the past month, the releases had been part of the budget that one had dismissed in June.
A member of the city advice shot back and declared it that in the budget would nothing specify, that colleagues of the school aid would be released.
Officials of the city advice 37 said, they would have and warned the development ministry against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference, on which the submitting of the complaint formally is announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint becomes Mr. Itemize Walcott and the development ministry of the city as an accused and count eight released workers as a complainant, who are altogether colored or Latin American women, how that of the helpers that lost its work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the justice ministry of the city, said, would lie could not comment on become the city the complaint not before and therefore its single statements.
According to a complaint design, that exists the New York Times, the labor union concentrated on the amount of the releases at the schools in the arm quarters of the city in order to support a complaint because of unequal treatment. It maintains that poor schools more helpers would have lost, because they would be chronically lower financed.
It represents that, while it gave no releases on Staten Iceland and only a few releases in the schools of the upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school helpers in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, lost have and release became 46 helpers in the district 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five of eight school helpers, that in the public school 36 in Harlem where 68 percent of the students in poverty live, engaged were, purports the complaint: "This is no neighborhood betuchter parents who can organize contributions in order to catch" budget abridgments.
P.s.: The budget of the 36th district was shortened this year around 3.26 percent. Moreover moneys got lost when the city changed its calculation method for the extra financing for each arm school registration.
The labor union laments moreover that the leaders of the High Schools became err led by the language in a memo in that, which approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" in order to describe the action, also if "excess" (German: hand over) in the USA describes usually the change of a teacher of the salary list of a school into a pool of available workers, that are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators became release, does not hand over", purports the complaint design.
Mission concludes, notify congress ready, itself with respect to Libya
It looks in the end so, as would be republican and democrats in Washington already to notify itself with respect to the uprisings in Libya.
All what was necessary to this, was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the termination of the American interference.
On Thursday the committee will conclude for international relations of the senate a resolution, which is subordinate the chairperson together with senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph 1ST Lieberman (Connecticut) to John Kerry (Massachussetts), whereby one praises Libya for the successful rebellion and the US American troops for its "courage".
"This resolution honors the courageous people Libyens, that with the reconstruction of its country begun have", said Kerry.
"You is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts through two parties".
The language innocently likes to sound, but previously was nothing simple in the Libya debate.
Legislator of both parties and the white house fought this summer over the word choice of a row of resolution to the approval or disapproval of the roll of the US military in the Libya mission NATO.
In June Kerry and McCain produced a resolution, which approved the restricted utilization of military powers of the USA in Libya.
The law was rejected in the senate through a wide edge group of both parties and came it to no voting.
Yet at the same day, this law in the senate fell through. Moreover the chamber overruled a decision to the abridgment of the moneys for American operations in Libya.
Through it the US mission ran into a type legislative sweep ivy - with a congress, that to be sure raised was not enough to criticize Obamas procedure in the frame of the mission, but furiously enough in order to remove it finally the ground under the feet.
Then the irresolution of the congress was overtaken of the events.
Tripolis fell was killed in August under the Libyan rebel and Gaddafi on the 20th of October.
NATO mission ended officially on the 31st of October.
Now the senate is perhaps ready for actions.
The resolution of the committee for international relations "congratulates the person Libyens to its enormous courage and its extraordinary endurance in its even release" and "praises the men and women of the US American military and its coalition partners, who support the military operations to the protection of the people in Libya, for its extraordinary courage and its professionalism".
The resolution strengthens moreover "the national interests of the United States at a successful and irrevocable transition Libyens to the democracy".
Are the new measures received or will split the full support by the group for foreign relations it the legislators how it did the law of the June?
The last frame bumps Richard G into the resistance of the senator. Lugar (Indianapolis), the sharpening republican of the committee.
Lugars speaker said on Monday that he had not seen previously the final frame of the new law yet.
According to capitol, it lies at the senate to vote this week over a constitutional change, that demands a balanced household, a Top priority in almost every congress legislative period of the republicans and some democrats.
Goodlatte (Virginia) quaked will be the measures under the direction of the republican the first constitutional change of the household or another area, that comes at present to the voting in the senate or congress.
Other legislators previously unsuccessfully tried to bring its changes to the voting although they tried it often enough.
Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes, that were produced this congress and comprise an entire bandwidth of subjects.
Some are doubly - the same law became both the congress and the senate produced - other soft only easily from one another off.
There are control" would become at least 15 versions of the balance household change and a further dozen, that "federal editions alone in the senate.
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give its client - especially beginner at the republicans, that its résumé polish up want - the possibility therewith to boast that they have such a measure "composed".
The household control law that was dismissed in August requires that both senate and congress vote over a change of the household balance.
In March 58 senators agreed for a not binding resolution, that supports the idea of such a change.
Over the household out some members want to limit the amount of the determinations, that members of the congress can produce, while the republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to cancel the limitation on two tenures of the president.
The republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) proposed a row of changes, that guarantee among other things the right on a good development and hygiene.
A change that forbids a marriage under Gleichgeschlechtlichen is just as as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, an always recurring model.
Some legislators want to enable moreover the lifting of federal laws if two-thirds of the countries reject this.
How the members propose changes, they so unequally more quickly move like in the past years.
In the 111th congress, legislators 77 of such changes put before. in the 110th congress 66.
The speed pales in comparison with that of the early '1990's, in which members proposed regularly more than 150 changes every two years, so the numbers that the senate library makes available.
Yet they were not also much more successful than the current.
The last change to add that is - that 27th -, was ratified 1992, was proposed however actually already 1789 the congress.
"Missed, but overcomes", so Giffords in the first TV interview after the attempt
Ten months after an armed man had shot out of next distance during a choice organization in Tucson on it, appeared the republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) Monday evening in the national television. It sang wants alone to the Broadway piece "The Sun Come Out Tomorrow" and said, the wish to recover, be larger than that to return into the congress.
When it appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC messages "20/20", it wrestled after words and needed aid in the going.
The shipment showed the heavy slow recovery of the damage, that the ball caused, that divided its skull, that bores through left side of its brain and, crossed its head at the beginning until behind.
Three months ago it returned surprisingly into the congress in order to deliver triumphing its voice to the guilt brake.
In its first TV interview after the attempt in January, with which six people were killed and 13 were injured, smiled Gifford, laughed and sang - and described its recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked it, how she would feel, Gifford (41) answered: "Very well".
The interview with Gifford and its husband, the astronaut mark Kelly, was part of an one-hour „20/20"-Specials, that was recorded shortly before the publication of the new beech of the married couple: "Gabby: A story over courage and hope".
The Special pursues Giffords recovery since the attempt of the 8th of January.
In videos, that had recorded Kelly in the first weeks, one sees it in the hospital bed, with barely shaved head and a long scarf over the forehead.
It can only on or two fingers lift if its husband encourages it in addition.
Giffords in a wheelchair later sits months while therapists show it, how it carries out simple movements.
A nod with the head.
A twitching with the lip.
And then, its first words: "What."
After few days, Giffords whispers a further word: "Toast". It would like that its breakfast is changed.
Videos, that are played back in the ABC show, show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: One sees, dried" Wanna Have like the congresswoman together with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "Girls just and sings to Tom Pettys "Free case'".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, that spends daily two hours with therapy, said, that she cannot remember the day of the attempt.
Your husband said that it had read Giffords on the 12th of March an article of a daily newspaper over the attempt, when it interrupted it and asked for the first time about the six people, who had been killed during the attempt.
The Jared lee Loughner presumed protection sits in a prison in Missouri on and obligatorily medically is treated while it waits for its negotiation.
"Many people died", told Giffords Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard".
In the course of the recovery of its wife, told Kelly Sawyer, said it: "I was encountered".
"Therefore, I would say: "Gabby, you were not overcome"?", said Kelly.
You only were encountered.
And you will stand through that and will recover you you and more strongly will return you than ever before.
Troops perceive sooner empathy than a respect
The event was a Wall Street formal event that gathered millions of dollar for homeless veterans in New York city.
Kid skirt sang a ballad over helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a cue there hundred soldiers, sailor, pilots and navy gathered around it around.
The quantity in black tuxedo rose and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers became as heros seen", said David Saltzman that the fund-raising campaign in the spring organized.
A high-ranking military officer on the formal event, that among other things by the rod boss and at that time chairperson, admiral Mike gauze observed became, saw the roll of the troops differently.
"You became like orphans introduced", wrote the officer in an e-mail.
I am certain, the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it was not no respect, really. It was empathy.
The blatant contradictory impressions illustrate dissociated the heavy relation between the military and that usually, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops will bombard with praise for its victims.
But the praise has its price, say service member.
The public behaves increasingly so, as would do its the people in uniform sorrow.
"We were in no way victim", said brigade general Sean B. MacFarland that troops in Iraq befehligte will go and to Afghanistan soon.
The single way of the support is "but apparent is that one to press" us into the roll of unfortunate souls.
The subject is extremely sensitive for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungratefully or in the dispute with the public, that serve it.
Also they recognized that the fury, that struck returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam war contrary to, was by far worse.
As a consequence, discussions about empathy in the nursing and private between war veteran take place.
After both sons out of fights with the navies returned are, the Colonel a. D warned. Mark Cancian it before that that people could see its service outside of the military world out of two different telescopes.
Some would observe it with a feeling of respect because it rebels were overcome and had traveled to exotic places.
Others would become themselves ask whether a "furious, violent veteran hides under the surface", said Cancian, that had fought in Iraq and received an elevated country post in Washington after its return.
While its work that which is sought, said it, sensed it that some of the Befrager questioned subtle, whether it would be in a position to withstand immediately after its return out of the battle the pressure of a demanding Postens in Washington.
"If its over your service speaks, must its the negative impressions on the other hand hold", explained Cancian its sons.
The missing lightness of the military is rooted in part in the missing interest of the Americans at the war.
Achievements on the battlefield become of a country that little experience has with the military and sees only little utility in the getting in Iraq and in Afghanistan, only rarely as a praise singled out.
"We as a nation appreciate military heroism no longer so, like it yet in the second world war was absolutely usual", said lieutenant general David Barno a. D., the US troops in Afghanistan befehligte.
Instead of its the praise of the politicians and the public concentrates chiefly on the sorrow of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the amount of the attacks, that bore it, the amount of the friends that they lost or for the heavy of its injuries.
Military stands the growing pressure for hard reaching through in rape
In this week, an important hearing decides about whether 28 women and men are not accused because of intervention in a rape before the court martial.
If it should not come in addition, hundreds of complainants stand for the next hearing ready.
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when it was raped at night by a soldier colleague.
It was returned 2008 and it just to its barracks in Miramar north in October of San Diego of the supper with a friend when it encountered on a masculine colleague, who carried a 12 pack beer with itself.
It asked it whether it would be allowed to accompany it on a Drink into its room.
"My alarm bells went at", said Lyman.
But the Texan wiped its objections aside.
I thought: "Alas what, it is 19.
It is from Texas", said it.
"I wished, I would have heard" on my belly feeling.
Few minutes after they had gone on Lymans room, the man stepped behind it, pressed it downward and raped it, maintains it.
This week, on the 18th of November, Lyman and 27 wait other present and earlier military employees anxiously for a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which decided becomes, whether a complaint, that they raised against the earlier Minister of Defense Robert Gates and its predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, is allowed, before court.
The complaint maintains that Gates and Rumsfeld against the far common rape within the military and under injury the constitutional right of the soldiers did not advance.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer out of Washington, D.C.S submitted, comprised the complaint originally 17 complainants, who increased however in the following months on 28: 25 Women and three men who maintain everyone, that they were raped or sexually abused by soldier colleague, and that the military neglected it to make available to determine, to convict or an appropriate jurisdiction after the supposed attacks.
Burke says, it would pursue the uppermost military leadership because the problem would begin there.
"The military is hierarchical constructed", says it.
"Who are the single people who are in the position to eradicate the culture reward of that to? The leadership".
Burke says moreover that it contacted for February almost 400 further surviving, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Your strategy: Instead of that all complainants put so to speak its eggs into a basket, become it if necessarily, many further complaints submit, around the pressure uprightly to receive.
The team of the defense for the defense ministry, cited of federal district attorney Neil MacBride, placed a proposal in order to reject complaint.
The acts of the court that exist Newsweek itemize in detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be accused by present or earlier soldier for injuries, to which it came in the military forces.
Based on a law of the Supreme Court from the year 1950, THE so-called Feres doctrine, sticks the government not for injuries, that are added itself in the active service of present soldier.
"The presumed damages emerged during the military service of the complainants", purports the document.
The defense ministry denies every commentary to this story.
The things changed since the '1950's.
If women are not allowed yet always to the service in the battle, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams play attach roles increasingly important by soldiers, especially in the contact with domestic women in the war zones.
The result: between these two getting 150 soldiers, two-thirds of them in battle actions died.
It is at the time that the military is modernized, says Burke.
And it does not stand there in its battle alone: three further complaints except hers are pending.
At the Yale Law School prepares the veterans' legal services Clinic a complaint against the four most important military academies because of presumed support of a misogynistic atmosphere.
Hereof independently veteran gathers the public-spirited Vietnam of America a complaint against the military before, in which one concentrates on the diagnosis "personality interference", that rape victims received to release around it out of the service - an usual procedure according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the service Women's it Action network, a human right group.
Your group passed in December complaint against the veteran administration (dt. : Administration of the war veteran) on, in that it its practices discriminating in its contact with achievement claims for people reproached, who indicated to have become sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws was produced independently from one another through a mixture out of senators and representatives of both parties the congress, that offer a row of criteria.
2010 became according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (dt. : Office for prevention and message of sexual abuse) the defense ministry 3,158 sexual abuses indicated.
Yet most abuses are not reported at all and after the own estimation of the Pentagon, this number considers ca. 13.5 percent of the appreciated 19,000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report that was published in March examines also the punishment pursuit rates: 2010 came 20 percent of the grasped cases in the military before court, only half so many like in the civil law.
The complainants in Burkes case describe its attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lymans case, it reported the presumed rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
In this night, says it, became it 11 times asked to tell the details of its rape of a whole series of policemen, physicians and commanders.
It had was found a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of its aggressor, that came from a cut at its arm, in its bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, was listened to Lyman of a judge. During this hearing, it was asked about the sex, that it had spread before that with its friend.
Six people stated as character witnesses in the name of the presumed culprit, who was absolved in the end.
"I remind one me yet well of the day, when the judgment misread became", says Lyman.
"I thought would use, the pains. I raced screaming out of the courtoom".
"You brought remember into the psychiatric department and I me that I came out, when I again, to my commander said me: That was not its procedure. That was my procedure".
Lyman was requested to search for a military psychiatrist, who diagnosed in the end a personality interference and it for unfit for duty declared.
It became release in January 2010 dishonorable so that it receives no support at all.
Whether the complaint, that Lyman and the other complainants submitted, makes headway,, is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of the jurisprudence at the George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, so it notices in: "In my opinion, they should make headway".
What stands between them and a sentence, is this doctrine, that is criticized, since it was questioned for the first time.
I am for life a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military limps a decade afterwards, for they do not possess the same stimuli and the same deterrence that entails a liability.
It adds: "The chances stand against it... however it is important to it, that it it try".
These things will change only then if good people to fight are ready.
If the hearing does not follow its way, becomes Burke, that lawyer of the complainants begin, with its hundreds of other complainants for future cases.
"We become the military in this regard further fight, until it reforms comes", says it.
Or until we die, what enters also always first.
If wound have eyes: How researchers observe you on Facebook
Before it became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Behring Breivik was differently only an of many boys, who sent its Anti immigration opinion Online.
On Monday Breivik that stood had to have committed in a crazed rampage in Norway in July, with which 77 people were killed, its first public hearing before court.
Although Breivik alone may have acted, it is by far not alone in the cyberspace: It spent much time to its attack before its computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalist, that radical right-wing groups support on sides of social network.
After the tragedy of this in the summer researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
Yet how does one find it?
That is easily - one must log on only with Facebook.
"We assessed, that it was not heavy, to them to come", says Jamie Bartlett, the head author of a most young appeared report of the British idea factory DEMOES over the digital populism in Europe.
Data personal Facebook ambush is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett that the researchers must use simply the advertise tool of the side to determine around its desired demographic data with scientific accuracy exactly - so like it marketer for years have done.
Bartletts team found a half million fans of radical right-wing groups throughout Europe and adjusted it then with Adds on, but instead of linking itself with a new volume or a new diet product, invited the Adds users to a survey, in which after its development state, its bearing vis-à-vis force and the estimation of its own future asked became.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and its colleagues in a position, more were to be questioned than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without that they must would have left also only once its office.
"It is a quite new research method", says Bartlett.
Some of the results surprise hardly. Online promoters of radical right-wing groups are usually young, man-like and be angry about the immigration.
But in a type of surprising twisting, "that, that more sensibly combine its Online activism with an Offline activism, are, more democratic and less violent as that, that remain" sit behind its computer screens.
Only an example is DEMOES work how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and politics scientist use the side in order to study all, of health questions up to company trend such as in "Likes", text messages and status updates.
Users active with more than 800 millions, who add in the average three of contents per day, "data generates Facebook supernova" a Forschungsboom that the amount of the scientific works with the name of this side in the title in the last five years let climb around almost 800%.
For some researchers, the beautiful of Facebook is the fact that one can study through this side people, whom one does not reach normally with its Clipboard on the street.
"If you earlier tried to question people of the British national party, to identify" was it very heavy, it.
"You must first the party inform and that would have them never access grants", says Bartlett.
"With Facebook, that of all falls away - you go directly to them".
Others say that the side offers a possibility to recognize and to solve social health problems.
A current study of Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and its colleagues found out that students, who discussed its full intoxication on Facebook, tend, significantly more strongly to the Problemtrinken than students, who were quiet over this subject.
Moreno proposes that equivalent students, for example accustomed adviser, who supervise side and help a student, posts if this too many status updates.
"You can a problem do not solve, if you it not recognized have", said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko author and leader of the Child Health, Behavior and Development by the Children's it Research institutes in Seattle of the washington Post.
"We did not find differently found become were" a possibility to identify endangerd children, that.
Facebook taps moreover permanently the data of its own population.
The data team of the side has statistics over the relation status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout at the between choices 2010 and one nationally good fortune index generated (where primarily statements uses became, on that only Facebook access has - master of the digital freedom know for some time, that the side its large data treasure trove for other research purposes accessibly make should).
Yet the users of Facebook do not know that the side observes it, whether they want that now or. Around with a friend, who is removed thousands of miles to be able to play Scrabble, permitted one the side the own personal data pass from.
But what do if the users of Facebook part of a survey become, of which they not know yet once something?
While researchers have guidelines exertally determined, how they gather its data Offline, is permitted Online everything.
"I believe not, that many users generally over the fact thought have, that a researcher its profiles study could", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist in the London Knowledge lived, to a study from the year 2006, in which he examined the public sides of students on Facebook.
"What concerns it, concerned it only it and its friends".
Then there is yet the question of the methodics.
Even Offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is to be known impossible how many of the statements in a user profile and in contributions are true.
"What one on Facebook says and what one outside of of Facebook makes, are two totally different things", says Selwyn.
Therefore Selwyn thinks in spite of its years as a technology researcher that a Clipboard and a pencil are yet always the best research tools, that everyone can use.
"It gives no replacement for that, into the real world to go out and with real person to speak", says he.
"Social research must attend to the social - and a lot of social life finds yet always Offline instead of".
"Coldly and inhuman" : Differently Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Differently Behring Breivik, that man, who stood two crazed rampages, with which in this summer in Norway 77 people were killed, described itself in its first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" of fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway", said he before a courtoom with more than 500 people.
"I raise objection against the court because you received your mandate of organizations, that hate ideologies support and because through it the Multikulturalismus becomes" supported.
"I acknowledge the laws, but I do not admit guilt".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he did not want to give "Breivik the possibility to use this hearing as a platform, on that he its views to the expression bring can".
For the same reason, it denied Breivik that a beforehand composed speech brought along, the permission to turn to the end of the hearing at the members of its victims.
Nesheim arranged moreover that the police Breivik retains for 12 further weeks in detention, it four weeks no access to the media has. It said that the authorities exactly will control all visits and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
Approximately 30 surviving and member of the victims took at the hearing part.
Some came look in the hope, Breivik into the eye to can, others wanted the confirmation that it remains behind lock and bar.
Everyone took part with the goal that all runs out on a locking up.
"I thought, it causes coldly and inhuman", told a surviving of Utoya the Norwegian transmitter NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me, it goes on a piece after I seen the suspect and have" belonged.
Breivik carried a dark suit and a blue necktie and caused during the entire hearing quietly and professionally. He viewed journalists and surviving into the eyes when he entered the building and left again.
Reference bizarre in spite of Breiviks, he part of a larger "resistance" movement would be, came the judge to the end that he would not be and said insane, that there would be no proof, that he would have had accomplices.
It does not like to unite please that the attacks of the 22nd of July was apparent the work of a single extremist and that of a group more radical.
Does that but ease automatically the grief and the confusion that an entire nation yet always senses?
"I wished, it would look like a monster, but that does it not", said the member of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if it did" it.
7 Lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve jobs that this week in a theater was shown
After death of Steve jobs on the 5th of October some compared it to Henry Ford and lifted at the same time the technology genius as a large modern inventor forth.
What Apple fans find however perhaps informativest in the most young again discovered job interview, which became in this week before special film demonstrations on the important markets entstaubt, is how very this creative head understood business processes and work flows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and even appointed hip pi, but he was did handicrafts also a meticulous organizer, that enthusiastically at charts - a man who believed, that many managers suffer from "an illness of the thinking", "that a really magnificent idea 90 percent of the work settles... [however] There is an enormous quantity at craftsmanship between a magnificent idea and a magnificent product".
1995 developed quaked Cringely the series of TV "triumph the specialists with no other interests" over the departure the personnel computer. And it sat more long than an hour with jobs together, in which they led one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At this time had passed as a 10 years since jobs had been pressed out of Apple. And he worked looked already hard at its new computer business NeXT, and forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part was used by Cringleys interview in specialists with no other interests, he says that the copy model of the interview were absent from the delivery.
First after jobs death one discovered a complete VHS copy in the garage of the director.
This easily revised film material forms the base for the 68minütigen film "Steve jobs: The lost interview", that this Wednesday and Thursday comes into the country marks theaters.
For someone, who is for that well known that it detests detailed interview, appears jobs here surprisingly enthusiastically in the explanation of its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly reflectively.
In the course of the interview, it comes four times to longer recesses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds pondering in which jobs weighs unambiguously its thoughts and is striven around accuracy.
There is also moments, in which jobs comes' Perfektionismus too days, if it reacts apparently impatiently to Cringelys questions and to go in it anschubst, more quickly on subjects or subplots of larger importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone received appears the lost interview somehow uncannily farsighted if job values, what other businesses its opinion make correctly or incorrectly and its own vision to the future the computer represents.
It is a thing to read posthumous assessments of the career jobs'. To see but jobs here as the desirous dreamer, who is on the leap to the grandeur, is somewhat very differently, originally and inspiring.
It has a vision how the things could be and be should.
Shortly after it had carried out this here everything, it pulled loose and made it.
A fast view of seven remarkable sequence of the lost interviews:
How it learned to lead a business:
"During the entire years in the business I ask always: "Why do you do things"?. And the answer that you always get is: "Oh, so it simply is made".
No one knows why it does, what it does. No one in the business thinks really detailed about things.
I assessed that.
Jobs continues its efforts from to streamline the accounting in Apple.
Astonish, recorded became developed like costs - usually began one with "standard costs", that on bare supposition there numbers became and that then with "deviation" adapted became - it an automated factory that guaranteed, that the business costs could be determined into the smallest.
How the pope ridiculed became:
Jobs tells of that "Blue box", that it constructed with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one was able to sneak in into the telephone company and long distance calls was able to lead for nothing.
Over the device, much was written already, but jobs enthusiasm when it describes the Blue box as an act of the Selbstbemächtigung, is contagious.
It describes how Wozniak and it would test the box, in that they use a chargeable telephone, a call of active and then of an AT&T-network in another combine while they possible grind through so many satellites such as.
"We sent things a half dozen once around the globe and if one into the telephone grölte, came it a minute later in the telephone next door again out", tells jobs giggling.
"We were young and we learned that we ourselves can construct something, the trillion of dollar at infrastructure in the entire world control can".
We both, we much did not know, but we were able to construct this small thing, was believe that can control a gigantic thing, that an incredible lesson and I not that it would give without it Apple.
Jobs passes on of a glorious stroke, that Wozniak and it nearly had drawn-off, when they called middle in the night via Blue box in the Vatican and wanted to speak with the pope, during it so well it Henry Kissinger could imitated.
Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned middle in the night, in order to speak with the American diplomat, must loose laugh both before the pope himself came at the telephone.
How it into the technology fell in love (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called) :
At the age of 12 years, when it searched for spare parts, in order to construct a frequency meter, it searched Hewlett in the directory for Bill and called it on.
Shortly after its 20-minute telephone call received jobs for the summer a part-time job in Hewlett pack Ard.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the single business, that I had seen in the age, and it formed my views about that, what a business was and like good it its colleagues treated".
Later became jobs of one of the HP colleague, that visited the research laboratories of the business in Palo Alto, where he saw produced became" "the first desktop computer, that ever.
It was as large as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown scissors tube and I enamored me into it.
I would climb in HP as a teenager towards the top and would hang on this machine and write programs for it.
How one innovations improves:
Repeatedly in the interview speaks jobs about how one invents spontaneously new products.
Already early in its career when it incorporated some platinums, was asked it of a customer to assemble the entire computer.
It worked with a period allowed for payment of only 30 days and must both think out the assembly and the extradition of the finished devices.
Later in Apple, he remembers the problems, that he had in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remind one me of decisive arguments... You schrien on that it would last five years [around a mouse to construct, that $ 300 cost would become] and I stood me, went out and found a manufacturer".
We later had ninety days a mouse that we were able to construct let for $ 15. That was incredibly trustworthy.
Over large businesses, that diminish:
Long before it let Apple revival, predicted jobs the ways, on which so many industry giants with its visions in stumbling ridden and the control lost of its shares,.
Say we "work, you in IBM or Xerox, therefore you make a better copier or printer, well and"?
They possess the share monopoly, therefore the business is no longer successful.
Verkäufe and marketing make lead it more successfully, therefore [are it such people], that in the end the businesses and the product with which the people are pressed out of the decision-making.
The product genius, who led to this monopoly position, will have no draft of the people, that regarding good products vs. bad products, eradicated - craftsmanship necessarily.
That happened in Xerox...
Xerox would have been able to possess the entire computer industry.
One more largely would have been able to be ten times, would have can the Microsoft of the '1990's its...
They caught the defeat of the victory.
Over innovation as an art form:
"It lies a lot of craftsmanship between a magnificent idea and a magnificent product... if one this magnificent idea develops, changes it and are awake".
One learns much over its subtleties.
One must undertake votings, determined things, that one cannot, but electrons, glass, robot, factories.
One must notice himself 5000 things, join these drafts, and it everyone...
In the end it runs out runs on the taste, it on that out that one tries, with the best thing, that people created, apart sits down and tries then to join these things to that, what one makes.
Picasso said that good artists copy, magnificent artists swipe.
We are always shameless in the stealing of magnificent ideas.
Part its, what magnificently made Macintosh, was that the people who work there, musician, poet, artist, zoologists, historian were, who are accidental the best computer scientists of the world.
If it had not been the computer industry, they would create in other areas fantastic things.
Scalia and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the health laws when court case supposes
At the day, at which the Supreme Court meets behind locked doors, in order to discuss the politically dividing question whether one will listen to an attack of the health laws of president Obama, took two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, at a Dinner part, that became of the office gesponsort, that the case before court represented becomes.
The occurrence took place past Thursday when all nine judges to a discussion met in order to advise over the petition to the test.
A complaint, that 26 countries against the long-range reform of public health raised, was one of that to treated cases, that were concluded past year by the congress, a law that became at the conservative activists everywhere in the USA the slogan.
The judges agreed the hearing. Actually a 5 1/2-stündige base discussion is expected in March, will boost that probably its result probably the presidency battle 2012, that will be at the time, at which the court decision is announced, in the full gear.
The lawyer, who will stand and maintain before court, that the law is to be tipped over, will be probable Paul Clement, once general district attorney under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements office, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozen businesses, that supported the annual Dinner of the federalist company, an old-established group that dedicates itself the defense of conservative right principles.
One of the business associations represents another business, that the Dinner sponsorte, Jones Day,, that nationally Federation of Independent business, that contest the law.
A further sponsor was the pharmacy giants Pfizer inc. that enormously is involved financially in the result of the process.
The Dinner took place few hours after the court had advised over the case, in one Washington hotel.
Service had among other things Mitch McConnell, the floor leader of the republicans in the senate and a declared opponent of the health reform
The guests of the Dinners? Scalia and Thomas.
That is nothing new: Both judge have visited for years organizations of the federalist company.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In the deed judge of the code of behavior frees itself, who regulates the actions of the low federal judges.
If they were it, they would fall probably under principle 4c of the code, that following purports: "A judge can at Benefizveranstaltungen law more closely and other organizations participate whereby the judges may" be no speaker, guest of honor or according to program no guest of such an organization.
Nevertheless sufficed the extreme vicinity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the offices standing with the case in context as well as to a business with a massive financial interest in this in order to alarm moral-and-government activists.
"This stunning breach with moral and the contrast to the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court would comply with the same rules, that for all other federal judge count", said quaked Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil right movement in the USA.
"The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with floating procedures at the court".
Your appearance and its support of a fund-raising campaign for this organization undermine each claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration on critic, who say, they would become court matter too easy with groups, that can be led of the order of the day, how for example the federalist company, mix.
And the Thomas' wife Ginni a well known conservative activist is.
On the other hand the conservatives do not maintain that it would be judge Elena Kagan, that would have a moral problem, Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was general district attorney under the Obama government when the first law attacks in first instance came before court.
Your critics pressed Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the trap because of prejudice because it would be engaged too very in the defense of the law in order to be unbiased.
Kagan makes no institutes to do this.
Boeing pulls record order of 18 trillion dollar at country
Airlines emirates orders 50 two current airplanes of the type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 further airplanes.
Moreover Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner at Oman Air, a business in the value of more than a 1 trillion dollar.
It is actual a rare message that a business gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a large business if the business of the airplane manufacturers Boeing Co is. and the list price is for these 50 airplanes altogether about a record sum of 18 trillion dollar.
The client of Boeing is just as unusual: the Southwest Asia, a growing gold mine of future airplane orders.
In a prognosis, that was published on Monday, the Chicagoer business appreciates that airline requires airplanes in the value of 450 trillion dollar out of the Southwest Asia in the coming 20 years 2,520.
Boeing announced its largest order of all times at the weekend for commercial airplanes, measure by the value of the order: 50 two current Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came of the airlines emirates from Dubai.
The airline has moreover, gave notice Boeing it 2011 on the Dubais aviation show on, an option on the purchase of 20 further airplanes, that lets climb the entire list price on 26 trillion dollar.
On Monday ordered six Boeing 787-8 according to Boeing Oman Air then, that so named Dreamliner, that enormously improves the gasoline consumption and the comfort of the passengers.
The list price for six of these airplanes lies with more than a 1 trillion dollar.
"That is absolutely positive for Boeing", said Neal Dihora, stock exchange expert of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high".
Many airlines of the Southwest Asia are in the possession of the oils countries producing.
Therefore they have not only the money in order to pay the airplanes. Rather a climb of the oil prices that damages as a rule the airlines is not, because this is one of its largest costs points, so harmfully because the country earns at a higher oil price.
That is important because they tend less than other airline in addition to cancel or to shift airplane orders if the oil prices climb, said Dihora.
"You have a natural exclusion", said it.
The order of emirate strengthens Boeings lead on the market for greater area airplanes and helps, SOW the Airbus competitor to hold in chess, that the supremacy with the A350 attacks.
Boeings victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced, one would shift the introduction of the largest A350, that competes directly with the 777-300ER.
One shifted the introduction in order in to win more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher payload and range.
The Boeing shares climbed around 1.5% on $ 67.94.
Sister of the Mexican president loses apparently choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon maintains, that drug dealers opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race supported around the governor post.
The sister of Präsident Felipe Calderon lost apparently its application around the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent country choices. It maintained on Monday, drug dealers would have influenced the race for the benefit of one of its opponents.
After the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the institutional party of the revolution has, that PRI, that won race around the governor post in the western country.
"The intervention of the organized crime during the entire choice process and especially at the day of yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but rather for the entire country", said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the choice on Sunday.
"You our candidates, our colleagues in the surveys threatened... They occupied choice cabins, constructed delegates street blockade... and people, [for the PRI] to agree".
The PRI reigned seven decades in Mexico until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But it strive is after a return and the victory in Michoacan an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems only tightly struck Claderon to have, that the election day ago yet had led in the surveys.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of its brother, refused to acknowledge Vallejo as a victor.
Silvano aura oil, that candidate of the left democratic revolution party PRD, that presently yet officiating governor, came on place three, a heavy defeat for the split and hapless left leadership for the presidential election 2012.
Also aura oil refused, that to acknowledge preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections to drug dealers and presses the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan was controlled long time of drugs cartels, that specialized in marihuana, heroin and Amphetamine.
It is has selects the homeland of president Calderon and it Michoacan to start in December 2006 a militarily led offensive against drug dealer.
The force lasts yet always.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the choice during a choice organization for Luisa Maria Calderon and got off numerous candidates of anxiety out of the local choices.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, equal how repulsive the choices in Michoacan appear also.
The man, who probably will represent the PRI in the race around the president office, is Enrique Pena Nieto, that Vallejo congratulated and said out of Washington: "I think that this victory lets" look us courageous into the next year.
ADB presses Asia on aid in the rescue of the Eurozone
The development bank of Asia (Asian Development bank, ADB) calls India and China to support the rescue of the Eurozone in its heavy guilt crisis, in order to prevent a long-term downward trend, that will brake the growth of the economy of Asia.
Rajat Nag, administration director of the ADB with seat in Manila, said that both fastest growing economy nations of the world of "all in your power standing" must do in order to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the international currency foundation or through direct mutual agreements.
It warned look said against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), that "impassive" on the difficulties in Europe, and that the financial support of the European leadership and the European resources helps to prevent a long-term breakdown of the global economy through Asia.
"We sit all in the same boat".
"Therefore is every helpful, the Europes out of this crisis help can", said it the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the international economy forum in Mumbai.
"Asia likes to one certain degree protected be, but it is not immune".
"If China and India can help therefore, then with all means".
Europe monetary union ran in the past months into a heavy guilt crisis.
In the past days, interest costs increased Italy dangerously and the prime ministers both of Italy and of Greece resigned.
The arising heavy guilt crisis in Europe stirs fall could and led up anxieties, that the global economy into the recession to calls, the leading threshold countries would have to get together themselves in order to support the Eurozone.
Mr. Nag predicted that each support of Asia is channelled by the IMF, said however that mutual agreements - like for example the purchase of bandages of the EU rescue fund, that European finance stabilization facility (EFSF) - would offer negotiation power larger in Asia to the European partners.
Anand Sharma that Indian trade ministers said, that "India everything do becomes, what in its power stands", around the Eurozone to help, because the own economy suffers now foreign capital river from the sinking exports and the drying up.
"No one wants, that the Eurozone further unstabile and turbulent remains", said it.
"We stand must receive" a high growth plain before large challenges and we.
"It is no option, it is an order, for where otherwise we find work for our millions of young men and women".
Others argue that self-developing economies such as India have no occasion to help the rich Europeans if it itself stand before large economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the US American Brown University, said that it politically very heavily would be, to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India aid for Europe, of which more than 800 millions of 2 dollars or yet fewer live at the day at that.
"Sometime they will find out that the Greeks with 50 in pension go and spend vacation at the beach. Then one has a problem", said it.
Lee Howell, administration director of the international economy forum, asked similarly why India reserves should be used in order to retain the numerous and well paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in badly geleitetet, losses to arrangements bringing in such as about the railroad.
Mr. Nag said that the crises in the Eurozone will have "significant domino effects" on entirely Asia.
The prognosis of the ADB with an economic growth around 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/ "the risk of the gradation" threatens based on the threatening danger from Europe now.
It said, vulnerable threshold markets would have to generate "crisis of plans" in order to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital migration of its word shafts.
Urgent warnings out of the Pentagon before possible incisions in the defense being
Minister of Defense Leon Panetta heated the congress on Monday on when he warned before that, that automatic budget abridgments would weaken the national security unseen. Therewith it released a financial chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civil assembly lines.
The Pentagon thinks out already abridgments in height of 450 trillion dollar in the course of the coming decade, fears now however that further abridgments can become around 600 trillion dollar or more necessary, if the congress can obtain no conclusion in the editions.
"The effects of these abridgments would be devastating for the ministry", wrote Panetta in a letter to the republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
It said, would lead a failure of the congress in the obtaining of a budget agreement what will lead to a so-called seizure, to 23% general abridgments as well as a stop of numerous new projects.
"Such one high abridgment, carried out on such inconsiderate type and manner, would become that of our ship projects and building projects unworkable make - you cannot three-quarters of a ship or a building buy - and other modernization efforts seriously damage", wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would be forced moreover to separate us involuntary from a large part of our civil personnel and because the reduction so quickly would be transferred, must we with at security of bordering probability civilians beurlauben in order to can" reach the goal.
"These changes would destroy the belief of those, uprightly would be received that our military and seriously damage" our alarm readiness.
The abridgments became encounter in the end the battle troops", said Panetta.
"During the wartime units in the anti-terrorist battle through the seizure not directly concerned are, would become the serious intervention into the reason budget the war efforts disadvantageously influence", warned Panetta.
"Personnel attitudes were shortened become, what would become" lead delays in the attitudes and the attitude supervision, that support the war.
"The salaries of the personnel would be shortened, what leads to late payments at wartime dealer and disturbed" would be the legal like also political support.
Panetta answered both senators 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic abridgments on the defense ministry.
"The consequences of a seizure of the defense ministry would initiate" a fast decline of the United States as a leading military power of the world.
"We are vehement against this draconian action", said the senators in a joint explanation on Monday afternoon when they published Panettas letter.
"This is is a result with which we cannot live, and it certainly no that one should" impose us.
"The seizure is not should become" a threat of the national security interests the united place and its entering allowed.
To exempt whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or demands will reinforce, the Pentagon from abridgments, remains to await.
Panetta expressed increasingly blunt the possible abridgments although it was able to gather many years experiences with the budget in the congress and in the white house, before it came at the tip of the Pentagon, and knows that it stands vis-à-vis heavy decisions.
On a press conference in the past week, the Minister of Defense painted be forthcoming could a gloomy picture, what - a military with shell, but without kernel.
"It is a ship without sailor".
"It is a brigade without ammunition".
"It is a Luftwaffengeschwader without sufficiently educated pilots".
"It is a paper tiger, an army of the barracks, building and bombs without sufficiently educated soldiers, that in a position are, the mission to fulfill", said Panetta in its opening talk in the Pentagon.
"It is a dispute power, that it lacks at moral and alarm readiness and that is not in a position, to receive" it with potential opponents.
"You lets become" one actually furiously.
In a supplement to its letters at McCain and Graham, Panetta cited creates new details, like reductions "significant strategic risks: Delays in periods of crisis, conflicts and catastrophes, serious restrictions of our worldwide use capacity and intervention capacity, what to an unacceptable risk in future war operations leads".
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects of the deletion could fall victim, inclusive those who already were tested and be already in the early planning phase.
To this list, also the battle flyer belongs F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb airplane, the next generation of ballistic U boats, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground battle vehicle that Army and navy need in order to replace the Humvee.
If one would stop the further development and the tests of the F35, this would save in the next 10 years to 80 trillion dollar, but the advocates say that it is an important next step to the rearmament, so that possible dangers by China and other opponents banned will can.
How one uncovers a lie
A view of the current headlines shows, like doubtful and far spreads are deceit and lie in the daily life.
The presidency candidate of the republicans, Herman Cain, is busied therewith to become the accusations of sexual annoyance on the part of several women gentleman. Both sides accuse themselves mutually the lie.
The direction of Penn State is accused the perjury because one held back nominally reports, after which a retired Footballtrainer boy sexually abused.
In the past week was listened to with over an open microphone when the French president of the state Nikolas Sarkozy maintained vis-à-vis the American Präsidenten Barack Obama, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu would be a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
That congresswoman New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made itself to the fool when it brought denials in circulation, that were refuted very quickly by irrefutable proofs.
The earlier presidency candidate John Edwards is accused the offences in the campaign financing, that stands in the context with the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then no one whom it experienced forgets naturally, the medium circus that President Bill Clinton released, when he put during its second tenure in the oval Office regarding its sexual relation to Monica Lewinsky.
Stories over cheating in the school and in College tests far are spread.
There were occurrences, with which teachers purported its student the test answers, so that it itself stood there in its achievement examinations well.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much do deceit we experience?
How studies cover, let's lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies count however as a need lies.
Another study shows that strange lie to itself mutually three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize lying and/or to uncover" "lies is one, that importantly is to be learned for every person, and this both out of personal like also for professional reasons.
Far of a company game such as for example Scharaden removes, in which it is the goal, "Hab you"! to call, is the uncovering of a deceit a serious white area that is based on scientific data, that were gathered in the course of the past six decades at esteemed universities, that carried out long-range research projects, especially in the areas psychology and physiology.
A result of the research is that most old myths became uncovers over the lying.
Lie view one into the eyes.
They stutter, stammer, blush and fidget not always.
Hence one not however may close that these liars are to be uncovered and are to be uncovered heavily.
A practiced Lügenenttarner can permeate to the truth in that it learns something over the structure of the statement the fine expressions, over question and timing.
I spent several years therewith to examine the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of the uncovering. And it is clearly that the uncovering of a deceit is a modern capacity, that is to be learned easily and helps us in the getting along in our complex world, especially if the adjusting or the questioning of people or negotiations or administration to the own professional responsibilities belong.
Good liars are very well therein, to estimate other people, whose interest to wake and to control the own emotions. And they sense intuitive how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we, who lie extroverted people more frequent than introverted people, know, that men serve more frequently "even oriented" lies as women, whose lies more "at others orient" themselves - as a rule want to protect it therewith the feelings of others -that married people frequently would adjoin its partners fewer than unmarried people (however the lies, that it tell, are most "fat lies").
We know also that, if a person became uncovers as a culprit, other fewer indebted feel to have designed this person.
How does one recognize whether someone lies?
First, in that you observe the normal behavior of this person.
One names that "Baselining", the exit position.
It purports a general reference point for later valuing of variations.
Observe the bearing, the laughing, the voice quality of its test subject.
They better should know when someone do not accuse normally permanently with the foot trippelt, so that it it to wrong, if it during a Meetings with the foot trippelt.
Then you pay attention more noticeable verbaler and nonverbaler manners to accumulation.
Do not regard this accumulation as an alarm bells, the shrill, as a proof of an uncovering.
People who deceive, harden perhaps if they try to remember its story. Perhaps its feet show lean themselves toward door or it toward exit, change its position in significant manner or show one "relaxation after the attitude conversation", this deep, relaxing breathing out and the change in the bearing if all hard questions are past.
Asking signal often falsely that an attitude conversation is past, to hold only around after this relaxation after the attitude conversation lookout.
Eighth you moreover on the language of your test subject.
The slip of Scott Peterson is famous when it used the past form, when it maintained, its killed wife would be live yet at that and search released a national for it.
Deceptive people can use also a dissociating language: "I no sexual relation with this woman had... Miss Lewinsky" or if one repeats a knifflige question in the entire.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Many people use "qualifying language" if they answer a knifflige question: To say „Nun.. around you the truth... so far well known is me... after best knowledge and conscience".
Hereby the answer becomes sooner perceiving as objective by what means often the alarm bells of shrill.
There is no magic means for uncovering of lies, but one can learn capacities, thanks to which an uncovering is possible.
Thanks to these capacities, every can become rarer the victim of frauds, both in that privately like in the professional life.
Disputed plan of an oil pipeline is revised after threat through delayed US permission
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the permission of a planned oil pipeline of Canada into the gulf of Mexico wherewith one calmed the labor unions annoyed and simultaneously conservationist, is striven the business constructing the pipeline to plan the project newly so that one can return again to the normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that one will reroute the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive zone of the sand hall in Nebraska.
The business announced the decision on a press conference in the parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the business would be confident further, that the pipeline in the end approved becomes if also with one other course.
To this it came after an announcement of the foreign ministry in the past week, after which one would adjourn one a decision regarding a federal allowance for the project, until the new possible course would be reviewed, that would avoid the zone of the sand hall in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a large lower water supply.
"This is a real step ahead", said the republican lee Terry, a republican out of Nebraska, vis-à-vis Fox News.
The new environment examination that the foreign ministry arranged likes to adjourn a decision until 2013, after which choices in the coming year, also if officials deny, that politicians were involved into the decision.
Obama explained would be and said past week in a written explanation, that the decision a task of the foreign ministry its support to.
Canada became connect the 1700-Meilen-Pipeline 1700-Meilen-Pipeline miles of 1700-Meilen-Pipeline pipeline with the gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 Barrel oils per day out of the province Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To this the pipeline would have to cross six countries.
Conservationists hate appreciate it, but labor markets of dear it, for it that the pipeline of 20,000 jobs creates.
Yet the legislators Nebraskas that are against the plan, would weigh the laws, around a departure of the region of the sand hall and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation, to force.
The current study to the influence on the environment of the foreign ministry found out that the project only little influence would have on the environment, but purports the source of the energy economy that the head inspector of the ministry requested a separate probe of the examination procedure, that concentrates on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist that was adjusted by TransCanada sticks, Paul Elliott, that 2008 advisers of Hillary Clinton was, in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a business that was delegated to carry out the original study, an unsuitable choice was because it stands with TransCanada in connection.
Patti LaBelle accused, because it forced nominally an infant out of anxiety in addition, to vomit
A New York family maintains that the disco Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobbies of its Manhattaner of building would have got a frenzy attack, that would have transferred its small daughter so in anxiety, that she delivered herself before anxiety.
The harangue of the "lady Marmalade" -singer such anxiety made the 18 months of Genevieve Monk old that she would suffer changes, insomnia" and "increased fear from "personality of strange", said its family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.

Roseanna Monk said, it had stopped in the vicinity of the door and had dropped its daughter for a moment.
"Someone appear behind me and said: You do "know what your daughter just does"? I said, went "yes", and there to take around it again on the arm", said it.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman furiously.
"You said in an aggressive tone: "You should your daughter not in the vicinity of the door drop", said Roseanna Monk.
"I said its: "It does not interest say or think" me, what you."
It became furiously and caught on, to scold - it used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
It had a bottle of water in the hand and began to tip over water out of the bottle on me.
It said, Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman: "See you, what you with my daughter made have", said the mother of the child.
LaBelle fell must held back itself on the mother, who carried yet always Genevieve on the arm, and of its accompaniment and pulled become a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so very that it had to deliver itself, said it.
Later the family LaBelle apologized in writing a, received however no answer.
LaBelles lawyer and representative did not answer on calls, in which around an attitude asked became.
The complaint reads on a not more closely certain compensation, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he would take no honorarium into account and would plan the family, that will contribute money, that would get it, the child cancer aid.
"We want, that Patti LaBelle the responsibility for its behavior receives", said Davis.
"This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is put vis-à-vis a nursery school teacher at the day, that baby old a 18 month on the arm carries".
Climatic adversities braked the economy
In the first year, in which Mario López Valdez is at the government, unemployment and the illicit work climbed in Sinaloa while the foreign investments returned and the economy stagnated.
2011 will remain in the economy story Sinaloas in memory. It is the first year, at which Mario López Valdez, that designates itself as the initiator of the change and large hopes stirred up regarding the economic growth, at which government is. However as a result of the climatic adversity, the speech cannot be of growth, but rather to the contrary the most important economy indicators deteriorated themselves.
The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in million height in the agriculture, but rather boundaries narrow the country economy and caused in the first quarter year put back concerns in addition the growth a general decline of the economic activity 3.6 percent this mainly on the historic dismantling of the agricultural development around 31.16 percent, that affected braking further economy sectors.
In accordance with one of the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (dt. Mexican advice for persistent agricultural development) published report on the effects of the frost 582,000 hectares of agriculturally used country eggs were damaged whereby 78.03 percent partially were destroyed perfect and the remaining 21.07 percent. Concerned were the vegetable annex, corn annex and giggle pea annex above all.
The decline of the economic activity until November have continuously increase let unemployment in the Mexican country. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed in the first quarter year a fast climb of unemployment, for from January to March 55,053 inhabitants Sinaloas had no employment what corresponds to 4.53 percent of the acquisition population. In the second quarter, the unemployed rate increased to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, what has the 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa as a consequence. Those are 18,969 people more than in the first quarter year.
Slighter liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is due to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the faculty for economies and social sciences of the university Autónoma (UAS), comments on, would explain the politics of the public institutions indirectly the growing unemployment.
"What we observe presently, is a climb of unemployment, who has to do with several factors. Among other things with liquidity losses on the market as a result of the means abridgments through the legislation, that was dismissed to the fight of the money wash in the congress, for for that, that accumulate forbidden wise dollar to not let work is it easy, this for itself, to invest it or to use for otherwise something", explained it.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes referred on that that the growing unemployment also a demographic factor characterizes.
"The amount of the people, that leave search the country on for work abroad, especially in the United States,, returned. That is to be attributed on the one hand to the entry problems and is to be found on the other hand, because it also there hard work. These people remain here and seek increase lets here work, what unemployment", means he.
Illicit work
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is even more serious if one considers the high share of the illicit work. This comprises in accordance with INEGI 60.38 of percent that in the country of employed that work without depositing into the cash registers of the social insurance.
To unemployment and illicit work, the low wages, the lowest come throughout Mexico, in accordance with the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican social insurance institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (government authority for work and social care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of the employees in Sinaloa amounted to until September 5352 peso; that is very much less than the entire national average that is about 7375 pesos.
Decline of the ADI
Next to the dismantling of the economic activity and the growing unemployment, the strongest decline of the foreign direct investment (ADI) of the last ten years are indicated in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (national economy authority) the ADI from January to June 630,597 dollar amounted to what corresponds to a loss of 87.74 percent in comparison with the 5,143,312 dollar in the same period in the preceding year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (government authority for economic development) a total investment indicates on their part in the amount of 17 280,000 pesos per year 2011 that comes first and foremost of business from the tertiary sector.

In view of the economic crisis applied for the state government in July in the national congress a credit in the amount of 3 000,000,000 peso that should invest become the Reaktivierung of the economy into infrastructure projects in the 18 communities. The country congress approved a sum in the amount of 200 600,000 pesos, however no positive effects of the indebtedness could be assessed until November on any one of the branches of the economy in the country.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employer, the first government year made Mario López Valdés government inability obviously.
Miguel Loredo López, chairperson of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (national chamber of the processing industry in Mexico) represented that in 2011 no exertions were made to the harmonization of the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was this year really very needy. It hard must be worked in order to recover the grounds lost this year and 2012 must we doubly exert us. The exertions of all and especially the progress of the government team agreed already well on each other were not voted sufficiently on each other", explained it.
Slow economic development
Loredo López expressed that events, how the frost to beginning of the year slowed down the economic development of the country impeded and.
"The slight economy river is the result of several events, among other things the frost. One is slowed down one of the most important effects economy that is not sufficiently in movement in order to evoke an economy dynamics, that could produce an acceptable river of processes, products and services. Therefore we will lock the year far beneath our expectations", meant it.

There is much to do

It emphasized that the present power of the state of progress had made at the government.
"There are areas with respect to which one can say, that the government acted more comprehensive. What I can say, is that worked became and that the government is aware itself, that another quantity of work before it lies", expressed it.

It said, would amount to the total investment into these three programs almost 50 million pesos of which 25 percent fell on the country. Until now, only the Federación and the community to the structural work means would have driven by why a delay of the building termination is to be expected.
"12 million must it contributions, and although the year already to end goes, have it us no penny given, and that, although it us already in July a part should have paid", meant it.

Also if the national authorities would be obligated to the payment of these means, commented on it that at the minister for administration and finances,, applied for became to accelerate the administration works and to pay the being outstanding share as quickly as possible.
"Almost 12 million must it contributions, and although the year goes already to end, they gave" us no penny.
The court approves the transition for 2015 on the digital television in Mexico
The transposition of the analogous on digital signals belongs in the last years worldwide to the most important variations.
The colonel of court Mexico (SCJN) shwas will must the constitution complaints, that were submitted by the senate and the house of representatives against the presidential directive, and on the basis of that the switch from analogous to digital signals of 2021 on 2015 embarrassed, based on missing eight voices, that are required to the law attack, back.
A minority of four ministers, under that also the president the colonel court, Juan Silva Meza, was would have the view, the Präsident Felipe Calderón its responsibility not exceeded when he published the law decree with the details over the switch on the terrestrial digital television.
With this decision, that constitution dispute was rejected established by the senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight voices, so that the court could not decide over the constitution temperance or the constitution temperance. So the law in power remains.
In the project for the complaint, that was prepared by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, was proposed to declare the law decree to be unconstitutionally because for that the radio and television is responsible regulation relevant the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale commission for telecommunication in Mexico), why the law decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the law reservation.
For the benefit of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero itself agreed.
With this argument passed both the senate and the delegate chamber constitution troubles against the law decree on. After acceptance of the complaints, the minister Sánchez Cordero used the law decree no longer and adjusted all activities to the arrangement of the digital transmission.
The cabinet council rejected also the complaint submitted by the delegate chamber to enter without at the same time into the debate over the project, for which also the minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible.
In its contribution, the Prime Minister expressed to not to be with the arguments of the project agreed, and to be sure in the sense that the country government may not regulate with general directions the measures that the public administration should seize.
"I do not believe also that, if one would do that, the independence of the regulation place impaired would become". It remembered also that for the planning of strategic politics areas, like for example the sector of the telecommunication, for constitutional reasons the centrally national governments is responsible, for this leads the country matters.
The replacement of the analogous signals through digital is caused one of the most important variations, that took place in the last years in the entire world, and it a better utilization of the radio electric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more canals.
The postponing of the transposition, meant it, would be a delaying of the Nutznießung of the digitalization, what a decision in the public interest would be, that would have not only technical viewpoints, "for it would comprise economic, social, political and safety aspects".
These matters, emphasized it, "made the actions of the entire system required, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction through the country of included it a group of features, that the constitution into the hands of the centrally national government would put".
It called into the memory that many countries already would have carried out worldwide the digital transposition, and to be sure over the government, although it over highly specialized arrangements of ordered.
One could not conclude that the government with the publication of the contested law decree would interfere into the competences of the congress, for the laws dismissed by the legislature would be kept", assured it.
To count out the possibility the ballots in Michoacán individually is pulled in deliberation
In accordance with the statements of PREP, the difference between the first and the second place amounts to in the choice of the governor nearly 27 percent whereby 879 voices were not counted out of altogether 6074 yet.
The possibility of the single counting of the ballot is this year in the choices in Michoacán a reality, for in accordance with the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place amounts to in the governor choices nearly 27 percent whereby 879 voices were not counted out of altogether 6074 yet.
In this sense, the president of the Consejo general del Instituto Electoral has de Michoacán (IEM), María de loosely Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, remembers that just once at the past 9th of November the choice place had dismissed a row of regulations to the harmonization of the local directions with the reforms of the states in choice matters.
It would be remembered that Michoacán had adapted neither its political constitution nor its choice law yet its law over the choice justice to the reforms dismissed by the congress, so that these had not stepped in this choice round effective. The governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the country indicator within the time periods planned for that with the argument still to have objections on the other hand.
On the 9th of November, the colonel of court Mexico (SCJN) decided the voice of the country delegates to the constitution reforms over the constitution complaints submitted by the local legislature and judged as "invalidly and illegally" because this would not be right the to "to conclude about that or to insert" a veto on the other hand.
María de loosely Ángeles Llanderal declared in an interview over the possibility of the single counting of the voices that thanks to the acceptance of the guidelines through the Consejo general del IEM now the possibility would exist, that the local choice authority could count out the ballots partially or completely.
So that cannot under the following conditions in one or several choice packages contained voices partially counted out become the results in the protocols agree unanimously; the protocol over the voice counting and -calculation does not exist act moderate not or it is in the possession of the chairperson of the choice committee or it gives obvious mistakes or alterations in the protocols.
Moreover the entire counting of the completely filled out polling cards can result then if there are a difference between the presumed winner and that that stands on the second place,, that same or more slightly than an one percent is, prefaced lies at the beginning of the session a specific proposal of the party bzw. coalition chairperson before, whom the second of the named candidates is.
The voice counting can result also in its entirety if after conclusion of the orderly calculation assessed becomes, that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate is on the second place same or more slightly than an one percent, prefaced lies it a specific proposal of a representative of the party whose candidate second became, before. In this case, the choice packages that were stopped a partial counting would be excluded.
Worth mentioning is that the choices are in Morelia in the same situation, where in accordance with PREP the difference between the first and the second place amounts to nearly 0.16 percent, although the voices were not counted out of 129 of altogether 923 choice protocols yet.

The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President Italy tomorrow in order to introduce this the new government, that the crisis, that led Italy at the edge of the economy breakdown, that should offer forehead.
A communication out of the presidency palace announced appointed meet would become, that that on Sunday Monti on Wednesday with the president of the state, Giorgio Napolitano, in order to confirm the formation of a government.
It is assumed that it will introduce a cabinet put together by a majority out of technocrats, although yet clear is not, when the new Prime Minister will begin its office.
Monti said, it would introduce the president of the state the results of the conversations with the political parties to the formation of a government.
"I would like my absolute confidence into the capacity of our country, with these difficult times finished to become, strengthen", said the former EU commissioner the journalist.
Monti did not confirm goes specifically the formation of a government, but out of its commentaries forth that the hindrances are overcome.
That "frame now well is demarcated", joined it thereto.
Monti created it in less than three days to form a government, that is much less time than normal. In the meantime Italy against a political and financial crisis, that drove the costs for the guilt into an intolerable height, fights.
The new government led by the former EU commissioner Monti must dismiss a hard austerity package, that was demanded by the Euro politicians, in order to recover the marred confidence in Italy.
The pressure to that hurries, grown stronger that weighs on Monti, yet through the fluctuating market condition, as a result of which the Italian government bonds were burdened for 10 years with 7 percent interests. That corresponds to the state, with which Greece and Ireland saw forced themselves, to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria announced the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said would support" we this government after all powers.
We believe that this government is the last chance, so that Italy comes out out of this need situation.
The chances of success Montis considerably were enlarged through the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, that had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe, that the exertions of the professor Monti in addition determines are, good results to induce", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the middle-to the right-party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is talked things out essential, for until now many of its members against a government existing by a majority out of technocrats, that just forms Monti.
Support of the parliament
The new government of Monti requires a strong parliamentary support to the conversion of the probably unpopular savings measures.
Resistance against its exertions or the out hesitation of the reforms could cause again a devastating attack of the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks exercises would be with its reference, a failure Montis a catastrophe, also pressure.
Monti began on Monday with its debates with political parties, labor unions and entrepreneur associations as well as with youth organizations and woman organizations.
Tuesday evening is supposed to be locked the session round.
Monti was appointed this Sunday of Napolitano, that started an extremely fast government change as an answer to the crisis.
After short sigh of relief toward the end of that last week when well known became, that Berlusconi would resign, reached as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister the costs for the Italian government bonds again critical boundaries.
A rescue of Italy with a country guilt in height of 1.8 trillion Euro, would be too much for the present EU rescue screen.
Monti said, its government would must to the next choices, that are held off presumably in 2013, last, in spite of the predictions that the politicians will give it only time to the conversion of the reforms to prefer in place of the choices.
Monti expressed, it would include gladly politician in its cabinet, but the large parties exist on that that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to its objections in view of the of the pressure of the financial markets imposed procedure.
Political sources refer on that that the mutual mistrust and the disagreement between the parties make the inclusion of people out of the political life in a complicated way.

More than 20 years were expected it, but assures the volumes that for it a dream realizes itself, if they play in Costa Rica.
The assured the bass and with founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva last week of Brazil out of an exclusively interview.
The volumes will be in the South American part of its tour to the celebration of its twenty twenty year-old existence and on Sunday, that 20., make it its single stop in Central America.
This day they step from 19.30 clock in the national stadium together with the volume The X from Los Angeles and read Robertas out of Costa Rica up.
They read a statement out of the conversation whose complete copy in the online edition of La Nación is to be found.
For your costaricanischen fans a dream realizes itself if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: You are aware, what means that for your fan?
To play in Costa Rica a dream that realizes itself also for us is.
That is just once the second time that we play in South America and Central America, and until now, it was magnificent.
I was only once to the vacation in Costa Rica. It is a so beautiful country that we will remain certainly another couple of day there.
For us, it is exciting, to bring our music there there.
I ask you that because the fans the volume are yielded totally. They experience the days before the concert most intensively.
What do you say your most enthused fan?
To stand thanks, all these years at our side.
We needed almost 21 years until we came after Costa Rica. Thanks, so long waited to have and it harms us to have needed so long until we came here.
Some people are of the opinion even that your concert will become the largest show of the year.
Does that not exercise a little pressure out of your visit?
Some of the most magnificent shows, that we left in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We played on a couple Riesenshows in Sao Paulo and hope we that that made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we are in the mood there to play.
We love this country, we surf gladly and are enthused of the jungle. For that Costa Rica to the best countries of the world belongs.
How did you become acquainted with Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are have surfer and I a magnificent friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends went always for surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the areas outstanding for surfing. In this manner, over people, who love the surfing, we learned therefrom.
With a view of the tour, its Riesenshows with many songs offered.
Which plans do you have for the organization in Costa Rica?
Because we never played there, we sit down also no boundaries.
We will try to give the optimum show with many different songs. We want to play a couple of song out of every album and want to offer our fan a good and multilateral repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I believe, that is in part so because we can have nine disks and can play over 120 songs. Everyone pleases another song so that the decision which we will play respectively does not fall, easily.
If we played two or three songs, that we already more long no longer, include in the repertoire, better uprightly can receive we our concentration and surprise it us because they call us the reasons into the memory, why these songs pleased us. Otherwise they could fall into oblivion.
That makes believe the show more interesting for us and I, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour celebrates it your twenty twenty year-old stories.
Do if you look back, it falls to believe you heavily in your success?
Yes, totally.
First of all once I believe that no one imagined of us to play once in a magnificent rock band, and that also yet over for 20 years. That causes like a dream.
We set also further on this blessing and find it crazy, also to be able to make now yet together music.
We like ourselves and are enthused therefrom, to produce music.
We have visit wanted good fortune to be able to go at the places of the world, that we already always once.
The things not better could stand.
What did it mean for you, at whom birth hour of the Grunge actively to have participated?
It was always an honor to belong to this group large volume.
We are good with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friendly.
It is surprisingly and amply unusual if a movement follows out of a group of friends.
There and again a volume follows out of a city, but it is already unusual if five or ten groups come simultaneously out of the same city.
We are proudly on that and feel honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play together still.
In the last year, we were saw on a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we Soundgarden on its tour. We are happy to be still with them of all friendly and it honors us to be part of this arisen Seattle Sounds.
It is also very unusual that a volume such as that remained together your times so long with the same musicians.
Yes, four of us have played together already for 21 years and mat (Cameron) knocked 13 years ago to us. That much is alone already survive more time, than many volumes.
First of all once I believe that we happily appreciate ourselves everyone to be yet alive and moreover we attend to one another.
We everyone am close friends why musical ways opened themselves, that give every single the freedom for experimenting.
One trusts to the other and its music. It not better could go us.
Your relations to the renown was not always simple. On the other side were able to make its thanks to your success always that, what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The type how we grew, more simply made us it to find a balance.
We place to be certain, not too often on tour, for it is too easy to decayed this game with gigantic crowds of people that love your music.
As long as one think, that the people came because of the music, remembers you that, that you the music and that what called it into life eighth must, without verse eat on that to its a famous rock star to be. That never interested us anyway.
Which memories do you have at your other project Mother Love Bone?
I believe, we wrote very good songs and to beginning, it was magnificent.
We were for three years a volume that never had published to death of Andy (Andrew Woods) a disk.
We were disappointed about that, to have needed so long. We are constructed yet always good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), that with us the volumes, friendly. If I hear a song or see photos, keep in mind I, what kind of incredible person Andy was and brought like he me for laughing. It was always a joy to go to the work, to laugh jointly and to speak over music and soccer and many other subjects.
It was miss an extraordinary person and we it.
Robertas read are the native volumes for the opening of the show in Costa Rica responsible.
Does it agree that it its works knows, especially Eddie Vedder, and chose the volumes therefore for the opening?
Yes, the production sent pleased us videos of several groups and these volumes us best. Therefore we are to be seen curiously, read live offer can what Robertas. That becomes certainly exciting.
Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter always if its live plays?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
It sings it, and I believe, it sings the first what occurs to it.
Of whom were you influenced as a bass?
Of so many +
To the first, that occur to me, Geezer butler, John Entwistle, belong C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
So many are that I could speak the entire afternoon over the basses, who please me.
How did it create Pearl Jam to hold the Grunge alive although it concerns no longer a fashion appearance?
I believe, feel connected us we everyone not very with the word Grunge.
If I think about that, occur me the volumes, that I mentioned previously, for example Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all other that arose to the same time. If they are yet important also today, I find that magnificently, for it is worthwhile to hear this music and make volume such as Mudhoney now better music than ever before.
Originally its music was is darker, now it more positive.
Why?
That is interesting, for I there believe is, a couple of song on the new album, that somewhat frivolously could cause. But there are also other songs such as The End or just Breathe, that are classified as a very dark songs, although they have also something positive at itself.
To both came heard played me the tears, when I like Ed it. Very dark songs are.
I believe if you more old become and something traumatic in your life happened is - for example if one a family member or a friend lost - influenced that your artistic creating and your music and both song embody that unambiguously for me.
I am however also the view that one can be a happy person and can make nevertheless dark music.

After the clearance, the door lock was exchanged in order to avoid a similar situation.

Park or mountain?
The architects are seen of the quarrellings over the honorariums with the announcement agreed.
The municipal announcement over the 16 gates opens the debate over the significance of Collserola in Barcelona on the new.
Middle of the '1980's, to the highpoint of the Corporación Metropolitana disappeared in the meantime de Barcelona (CMB), published this administration its lampoon over the support by Collserola.
The pamphlet described the mountain as a gigantic park in Barcelona city.
It was compared even in numbers to the Central park of New York.
With the downfall of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many became again the upper limit of Barcelona, for the capital Kataloniens belongs to the few, that does not spread out in north-south-direction, but rather towards the top (mountains) and below (sea).
The classification Collserolas as a nature reserve plays with this idea.
As an example, the Central park served now no longer, but rather Yellowstone with wild pigs in the roll of the Yogibärs.
One was so far when the city issued in September a giant announcement, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates after Collserola.
Undoubtedly a gate refers to the draft of a park.
That either is so, or someone intends to place gates on the country.
The question stands of even: Collserola, park or mountain?
The announcement is not only from organisational point of view, but rather also with regard to a reflection over the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is already almost a rekurrentes subject, on which two members of this old resident box can fall back, who meet in the procession.
And exactly this fact offers the material for one of the rare agreements between that, what three architects think from Barcelona about that, and to some university professors who applied themselves on the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The announcement is appropriate.
For Roldán "is it necessary" to speak after the attack on the coast over the "front at the mountains" as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, that was not expedited over the green apples.
"One should come from the principle that Barcelonas is largest park the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex", judges the architect, for which the title of "gates of Collserola" rescues a "lexical trap" in itself: One may not imagine it "as accesses to a park, but rather as a containment of zones, on which acted will must".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with city structural experience, regards the suggestion as one "intellectual challenge" that rescues "some dangers" in itself.
Dangers as a result of the "uncertainty, that the formation of a public room nowadays with itself brings" after the experiences out of the '1980's that had its "swan in the area of the forum song".
The first fear is the own containment on that, what may be cultivated.
"Something to limit meant always, the next step to determine" to exceed i.e. it.
"One must think about new city structural planning instruments, for the present [reference taking on the plan general Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead" to a real catastrophe.
Modol, that complies narrower with the question, does not mean simplified, the side of Collserola that goes toward Vallesana, "can than a park understood become, that in direction Barcelona", and to be sure out of purely topografischen reasons.
Modol does not remember that it gives already a study of the patronage de Collserola, that "on deaf ears knock should" although it gratefully would be to the city administration, that it gave its group the possibility to assist with this project "of the first moment at".
Moreover he notices in that the vicinity of the mountains to the city is the escort letter, that enables it the architect to participate in the debate although he expresses its "doubts" on that, whether this technical profile the established multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the correct", says he) guide should "we architects should only a tool be".
Bayona indicates that the answer would be complex to the question in the heading of this article, there in the announcement conditions a global visibility of Collserola false: "It became 16 competitions in the cross-section written out", says it, "on the axis mountains sea. But there is observes no along cut perspective, that the zone in its entirety".
That led at least in its case in addition that it participates in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise the program and the definition of a project would collide for a gate with that of the architect of the gate beside it.
According to its opinion the city unconditionally should guarantee that the strip is equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length so, that a soft transition between city and green zones emerges.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal that freely comes
After 72 days being quiet freed of that speech authorized the casino the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process, that is led against it because of presumed extortion.
After 72 days captivity Manuel Jonás Larrazábal freely is let, authorized forgive has after that the casino speech it before the second criminal court of the district, that leads the process against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey because of extortion.

After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 es Delitos patrimonial he was brought into the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the bar Rio Antiguo of the capital.
At this place, it remained 49 days after a second warrant after the official of the Ministerio Público had rejected the criminal offenses because of bribery and organized crimes.
On the 19th of October, it was transported into the custody institute of Cadereyta because it had bribed presumed the owners of the casino speech with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand it remained only a couple of hours in the means security section because murder threats existed against it.
The authorities of permitted it at which legal proceedings to participate as an inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de loosely Garza.
On the 25th of October, a custody ordinance was delivered it of the secretary of the second criminal court of the district, Jorge Yánez. This assessed that after the almost two months lasting investigations sufficient proofs would exist to speak around Jonás indebted for the payment of 1.5 million pesos at the representatives of the bet house in order to be able to open this in return.
This Monday requested of that speech, Víctor Aldo García Gómez authorized of casino the judge José Luis Pecina to release the brother of the mayor the punishment why he is set in the next hours at liberty.
During the judicial hearing, Ramiro Arias asked, that officials of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, assigned the court whether this the damage removed would have and which had expressed the owner of the bet house its forgiveness. The lawyer held back the name however.
In accordance with the right thing 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal freely is spoken. Also in the following, no objections against the process can be inserted, moreover no compensation is demanded.
After the hearing the authorized became the bet house against 15.50 clock Larrazabal Bretón immediately at liberty set.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de loosely Garza in order to announce Jonás that he had been absolved and its case would be put to the acts.
It informed it also about the judicial arrangement to the immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details over the airplane accident, with which the government secretary came Francisco Blake and further seven people around life,.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y carrier - SCT (secretariat for communication and carrier in Mexico) informed that the test result refer over the accident, with which the government secretary came Francisco Blake Mora and further seven people around life, on that, that the helicopter with its entire intact structure crashed directly against the ground, without that the pilot would have been able to initiate an emergency landing.
Dionisio Pérez Jácome mentioned in a press conference, secretary for communication and carrier that the pilot would have confirmed before the start, that been would be weather conditions for the flight suitable.
"The circumstance that the propeller wings in 25 meter heights contact with trees had, whereby the helicopter lost the hull, seems to refer on that that the helicopters had" had several ground contacts.
He explained also that the helicopter was constructed for 19 inmates, why he fulfilled all prerequisites for the carrier of the personnel.
Moreover it said that in the investigations in the field, on which the machine had come down, no stroke screw distributing were found.
"In the search no airplane parts were found at other places, the impact concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was constructed for 19 inmates why he fulfilled all prerequisites for the person carrier.
The zone shows a Schrägung of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently it is priority to got the test result as soon as possible, to be sure this could last several months, perhaps even a year.
For its part Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for airplanes and auxiliary services in Mexico) assured that the helicopter of the Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown in the impact with trip airspeed and the airplane had fallen on a slope soft.
"This information strengthens the acceptance that it concerned" at the time the impact a normal flight operation.
In a press conference, the leader itemized points six relevant the SCT, Pérez Jácome,, that should be considered in the investigation:
Visibility flight:
In the harmony with the flight standards, it concerned a flight after the rules of the visibility flight. That means that the team would have to have had during the flight and on the ground sufficient visibility.
Weather conditions:
The AICM indicated suitable weather conditions in the start. During the further flight in the direction of the border area between Mexico city and the Mexico country, some deeply hanging clouds raised.
Selected flight route:
It is possible that the team had selected because of the clouds a lower zone with better visibility in the direction of the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact place:
The impact coordinate and the last radar record of the helicopter agree. Possibly there was neither a control loss before the impact over the airplane another deviation of the flight route.
Verstreuung of the remnants of the airplane in a limited zone:
That until information existing to the present moment points on that that the helicopter was bounceed out of straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered airplane remainders let assume that the helicopter with its intact structure was bounceed on the ground.
No references to fire or explosion:
The remnants of the airplane offer let close at the accident place neither on fire yet on explosion.
The last test result point out several ground contacts.
In the investigations on the spot, airplane parts were found on a height of 9200 feet over the sea level. The terrain is steep and shows a Schrägung of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter broke probably.
Some information points on that that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a precise search on a zone, that went out over the closed off area at the accident place, no scattered airplane parts could be found, what reinforces the acceptance, that the intact airplane structure had crashed against the ground.
MSS gives notice a research protocol for discovering the gene for obesity on
You social insurance institute of Mexico lead a research project for discovering the gene for obesity with children and youth, who is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (social insurance institute of Mexico) announced that it leads a research project to the discovery of the gene for obesity with children and youth under the title "genetics of the obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers in connection with excess weight are supposed to be found.
Miguel Cruz López, leader of the Unidad de Investigación Médica e Bioquímica (department for medical research, focal point biochemistry) at the clinic hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team was constructed, consisting of physicians, sick caretakers, nourishment specialists and social workers.
This team becomes supported Salud Pública (INSP) of specialists and students of the Postgraduiertenstudiengangs at the Instituto Nacional de and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is participate invited to that in the study. Interested parties can come to the sport fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico where every Saturday from 8.00 clock tests with children and youth are carried out.
It emphasized that the investigation began on the sport field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state México) and is continued for the 8th of October on the sport field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the East of the state México).
If the goal is reached by 500 to 600 investigation people, the study is continued on the sport field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and is locked on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
It explained, let the goal of the study be the becoming acquainted with of the factors and the roll of the genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and youth to the prevention of chronic degenerativer diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide day of the diabetes declared it, it would be striven for that three thousand children and youth in the age of six to 14 years with the agreement and under supervision of its parents should fill out nourishment related questionnaires.
Also questions about are placed you its physical activity and its informal illness prehistory to control around risk factors, that could have diabetes or kidney insufficiency as a consequence.
It carried out furthermore that at the named Saturdays the investigation people measured (weight, size, waist circumference), its blood pressure controls and determines would become blood value such as the glucose mirror, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt of the identification of gene in the context with obesity at an early age).
Cruz López emphasized, this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the apprehension of the health personnel of person young over the alarming weight increase.
"The health surveys out of the years 1999 and 2006 yielded that in almost six years the share of obese boy had increased around 77 percent and that of the girls with obesity around 47 percent. Also the overweight-ness dramatically had increased", emphasized the specialist of the IMSS.
It indicated, the search for genetic markers would be established because the genetic story of the population of Mexico would differ of of that peoples other.
It indicated that a (e) mexican (in) in the average to 65 percent would be Indianly More american, to 30 percent More european and to 5 percent of African descent, what would be reflected in the genes, that stand with diabetes and excess weight in the context.
Very generally declared it, that genetics of the obesity would express itself in the inability to burn the excess of the energy (calories) taken to us so that this would be warehoused in the form of fat.
The researcher explained, who would exist direct utility for the investigation participants in a comprehensive investigation of the children, with which assessed would become, whether these showed a degree of overweight-ness or obesity.
It would refer even the occurrence of dark skin folds in the nape and at the interior arm (Akanthosis), that to the probability of metabolism interferences and diabetes in the before stage, examines.
All information confidentially would be treated and would be announced the parents in writing by the physicians. The physicians explain all fair results to the parents and strike them changes of the lifestyle before, that are appropriate to the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained, would give it three basic factors, that are responsible for excess weight, obesity and other chronic illnesses: To spend movement deficiency, that is missing movement in the everyday life, most time of the day before the television and to use means of transportation, to go in place of short ways on foot.
The high calorie reception, that is, an increased consumption at gezuckerten drinks and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger etc.) together with a high fat reception and protein reception as well as the genetics, that is supposed to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt of the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the faculty for chemistry at the Mexican university UNAM develops modified asphalts with polymers in order to make the mixture resistanter vis-à-vis weather conditions and variations in temperature
If became on the signs, that come from the street coating, respected to not to repair would be it required, almost 200,000 potholes if the rain time in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle breaks out de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the faculty for chemistry (FQ) at the university UNAM, warning and assured considerably diminishes that if the displaying and the maintenance of the asphalt coating would happen appropriate, the amount of the potholes or Even completely avoided become.
In its presentation "potholes from technical point of view", that it held on the occasion of the international year to the chemistry, announced it that the laboratory for which it is responsible would develop with polymers modified asphalts in order to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, that shows however a larger mechanical resistance both in high like also in low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera meant that this type of modified asphalts in areas with extremely hot climate should be used, like for example in some cities in the north of the country, in order to improve the behavior of the street coating and to avoid therewith the appearance of potholes.
It explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the petroleum - is a hydrocarbon connection, of that a part a high molecular weight has - the so named asphaltic - and the other part a low - THE so-called Malthene. Jointly they lend be the street coating characteristic tough elastic behavior.
Tough harvest table behavior of the asphalt meant that this behaves in high temperatures of almost 180°C like a fluid, in 120°C is it very viscous and in 50°C almost firm while it becomes in very low temperatures brittle.
"That is, that the robustness of the asphalt on the streets not uniform is, but rather itself at a day dependent upon the weather conditions and variations in temperature changes", led the chemical engineer from.
The researcher of the FQ noted, the streets of Mexico city would have by a majority a flexible street coating, that would consist of six material layers, of which the last three asphalts included.
Between the uppermost layers, a wear layer out of asphalt, that would lie hardened would consist of small, in asphalt of bathed and then stones.
Each single stone of this wear layer, be bathed become in asphalt.
If the vehicles move away themselves on that and powers are produced, this layer enables a good distribution of forces in the street coating.
"If it modified asphalt would be, would become the powers itself yet better distribute", meant the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer", carried out it, "a last layer is displayed, consists, i.e. of sand, that so named base, that out of tiny stones that was bathed also in asphalt.
Because this layer in the contact with the vehicle tires are, they require must produce a larger mechanical power as the wear layer and it friction.
That this street coating most powers receives and distributes, requires must be held the base moreover an appropriate thickness and the material out of which it exists, in place.
The weather conditions, especially moisture and variations in temperature, are further, important factors to be considered, first and foremost the water", said it, "for it impairs the behavior of the wear layer considerably.
If the terrain becomes damp, water penetrates into the layer and emerges only hard again. That causes a softening of all layers of the street coating and as a result the appearance of potholes.
If a pothole emerges", said it, "becomes first of all the cover layer worn out while the wear layer is impaired first after that. But the damage does not emerge immediately, but rather it concerns held become must a process, that in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs in place".
The member in the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (national research system of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load would be a further important cause for the appearance of potholes. Therefore the thickness of each layer of the street coating had to stand always in the relation to the vehicle load and would have to be guaranteed it that to the avoidance by frequent potholes this regulation is kept.
Rafael Herrera referred wait let on that, that yet many research projects to itself, for example over Asphaltemulsionen, that would be in other countries even already on the market, and with which the potholes let repair themselves simply and without application of high temperatures.
What did del Valle be missing the candidate in order to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that had an effect on that that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of the Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives its 14th Misstitel.
Again once Valle del Cauca went out empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time therewith satisfied had to give itself Melina Ramírez Serna to stand on the winner platform, a silver crown and the volume, that expels it as new Miss Colombia, to place to the show.
With the result preserved this night in Cartagena where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar at itself, comes associates itself the Departamento already on 14 Misstitel and Melina to the legion by women out of Valle del Cauca, that had held the crown nearly in the hands. Belong to the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María arena (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), g sharp yard of Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The large question that today many stand reads: What was missing?
For the result corresponds to the decline of a large favorite that had shown in every demonstration that it controlled everything in order to be the new Miss Colombia. For nothing it had not been selected to the queen of the police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, took title, that also the beauty queens had received Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and that itself the crown of the Miss Colombia home.
Does the first factor, that apply as decisively to the decision of the jury, of appointing it to the first Miss, is, influenced that it the answer to the question "which book you most strongly and why"?, that its of Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos placed become was, not convinces had.
The young woman out of Valle del Cauca reciprocated the questioner:
"I read much, I believe rather in the literature, I believe, it is itself a type to civilize, believe last of all I that the book that stamped for my childhood most strongly is, `Der small prince', a quite deeply going book.
Currently I read `Schuld and would long'. It is a book of the universal culture that we should read everyone. I read just a book of Irene Nemirovski, a russian, a beautiful book that is named `Leidenschaften'.
Civilize an answer that bumped against love into few first because of the term `sich and secondly because it had not explained concretely, on which manner of each had influenced of its book named it.
Melina declared but after conclusion the ceremony to feel quietly and happily with the result: "The universe is would show, it happens, what must happen.
And for all people: Reads please a little `Den of small prince'. It is a magnificent book.
Among other things is said that the favorite is burned out by el Valle.
A journalist out of Bogota did not indicate that the fact was, that it the preferred, that everyone of by cases had got einheimste and that in the forefield all prices, (gastronomy competition Oster, audience voting over the best handgeschneiderte costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates jealously made had, what the queen stresste, that therefore on the stage shine could".
One noticed and that in its first presentation in the bathing suit at the beach of the Hilton hotel and in both processions in the culmination celebration.
Although it certainly appeared in both, was missing its yet the power and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico to the show placed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como e casa" in the canal RCN did not mean that the fact was crowned, that Melina to the Miss, "shows, that the candidate, that during the competition most prices wins, in the end yet queen becomes".
Moreover Valle to the end of the press went out of the way - an error.
A further hypothesis is that Valle was not able to convince the Jurie regarding its interest for the social work, what last of all the essential of the national beauty competition is.
It will have already its reason that two days explained Lucy Doughty before the grouping of the international jury, they sought a woman who was committed to the social matters of its country.
"Beauty alone suffices for a Miss Colombia not. One must look out over the physical and must concentrate on the social perceiving, participate cooperated had on that, that it already before that in the competition on projects", explained it.
It is speculated also that Valle with its defects of the Derriere and the Fibrose, that one noticed in its in the stomach area, had sinned. But that is contradictory, for the jury selected it as a candidate for `natürliche beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The trainer of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina had not the best body, that there would be better, "but its problem with the Fibrose at the belly, that for me honestly said hardly to note was, pressed its score at the last day".
In the meantime the journalist Guido Hoyos of the periodical Cromos of the view, the mistake of the woman is had been out of Valle del Cauca the surgical intervention which she had subjected herself.
"The operations are ok, but Valle did not know how it correctly should make let it.
Your body never was its strong side, and it had to pay this place".
Because of this price, that will forgive the first time of the national beauty competition, a cruel prediction, that should become in the night true, emerged after the entrance in the bathing suit. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort price in order to not let come it into the enjoyment of the crown.
Equal whether that agrees or is not, fact that Melina begins from today its domination year, to be sure to not to represent as a queen, but rather as a princess, a position, who offers its the possibility, on appointment of the national beauty competition Colombia with one of the international competitions.
To be sure it becomes as one of the queens, that in spite of its overwhelming entrance for Cartagena the crown had escaped, in which story go in.
So the work of the physician, that the corpse of Alfonso Cano identified, was
A Lophoskopist out of Cali went in as the man, who identified "Alfonso Cano", into the story.
The work of this official plays a key roll.
At the past 4th of November, a Lophoskopist of the ascertainment unit of the district attorney's office (CTI) went in out of Cali as the man, who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - revolutionaries of military forces of Colombia), : "Alfonso Cano" through comparison of the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of the CTI, this week was on call cooperates Eliazar González, a man out of Puerto Tejada of that for 21 years in criminal investigative procedures.
At the beginning of its career, González worked in communities of Chocó where he had to proceed frequently for five days in the jungle in order to reach the place, at which the corpses were, that he should identify.
It moved 2000 after Valle and after the completion of the required courses specialized it on Lophoskopie, that is itself the investigation of the skin that is stopped frictions, i.e. the palms and floors.
In the week of the use against THE so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was referred on that to pack up clothing for at least three days.
Something large expected it.
It flew Friday night in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
It knew that it should identify two corpses, and that the suspicion existed, that one that of the man, that that had led Guerrilla of oldest the world, could be. Therefore it should bring the ten finger impression leaf of Guillermo León Sáenz (be actual name).
When it reached to be sure the place with the Untersuchungste, at which the corpse was, it was not able to identify it based on its physical appearance, for this did not resemble the images, that it had seen in the mass media, in the slightest.
It had no beard, was clothed like a farmer of the area, carried no glasses and was very much more thinly.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Arms compared to a magnifying glass, ink, a plant ladle and a flashlight Eliazar the fingerprints the corpse with which on the impression leaf.
It correctly had seen: It was "Alfonso Cano".
This man coming out of Puerto Tejada was to be announced yet the same night for that responsible to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it concerned actually the boss of the FARC.
On search for clues
For a Daktyloskopen of the Sijín in Cali, the assessment, that let become the Präsident Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González on a press conference over the use against "Cano" given, was, very importantly.
Many people do not know our work.
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without mistake quota, that can be a key factor in the solution of a criminal offense.
Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they support also ascertainments in murder things and robbery things and confirm the identity of the arrested people.
In its arrest, many offenders produce identification card papers incorrect or it have no.
We decrease them the fingerprints and seek this in the database.
The researcher told that he had to tear a piece of wall in a theft out of a house, for the thief had supported us itself exactly at this place with its hand when he extracted a safe fully plugged with jewelry and money.
"Would wind are difficult because its surfaces are unfit for the removal of fingerprints. But in this case, we were able to take the impression of the entire hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts,", remembered he.
With the help of the fingerprints, also murder suspects can be relieved or burdened.
Recently a dead was surrounded found of hard liquor bottles.
In the ascertainment was assumed that a family member tatverdächtig could be, and actually agreed a fingerprint on the bottle unanimously.
Although that does not guarantee, that it concerns the murderer, he is brought yet with the place, at which the criminal offense was committed, in context.
A Daktyloskopist of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would become" taken by the object.
If they appear, a plant ladle or a volume is used to the taking.
After that are sent the impressions at the Asif, is that the criminal database, or at the Personenstandamt.
"The problem is, that it yet always many colombian without identification card papers gives", explained the expert of the CTI.
It meant, would be not everything so how it would be represented in the series of TV SCI.
So how all gold is not, what shines, all is not also what one grasps, a fingerprint.
But nevertheless it can be used if one carries out a corresponding comparison.
The authorities in New York demand the "outraged"
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded itself in tents on the Zuccotti place.
A large part came later the clearance command and changed its location into a nearly lain park.
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street demanded this Tuesday the authorities New York when they tried with a judicial arrangement again to enter the Manhatten place after they had been cleared in the daybreak of the place and tries had to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded itself before the Zuccotti place, on which she wanted to get with a judicial arrangement, that permitted the "outraged" the renewed tent here, access. In the meantime complied another part of the movement with the clearance command and occupied a park further north in the city where it came to nine arrests.
"Our idea is, that, if the court us does not permit, on the place to camp, we us at one other place meet and the battle with legal means around the return to the Zuccotti continue, with sit in that and peaceful demonstrations", said mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray carried out that the answer of the "outraged" came on the clearance of its camp, that directly of Michael Bloomberg, that mayor had been arranged of New York, until before court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an arrangement, that forbid the violent clearance of the place, and the demonstrator that tents approved.
Moreover the "outraged" occupied a new park, that is at the intersection of the centrally lain Canal streets and the Sixth Avenue entirely in the vicinity of the entrance into the Holland tunnel, that connects New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church is.
They were able to occupy the place at least an hour long. But after that the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators although Bray can give no exact numbers. It assured the news agency Efe that it had seen under that also several journalists with handcuff.
The organization assures, it would have appeared itself hunderte of people here, at which also a delegation of religious leaders had arrived as a sign of its support of the members the movement and to the settlement with the police.
In the meantime the Zuccotti place (a terrain in private property) remains closed analyzed will should in expectation of a judicial hearing, that is prepared yet for this Tuesday, and in that the legality of the clearance taken place in the daybreak.
Some of the demonstrator driven by the place carried photocopies of this judicial arrangement with itself and distributed it. They gave it even some policeman who guarded the place, what had "some small collisions" as a consequence, how Bray reported, that had indicated, some policemen demonstrators would have struck.
The judicial direction forbids the authorities to clear members of Occupy Wall Street of the place as well as the application of "laws to forbid that were dismissed after the occupation and that the demonstrators with its tents and other things, that had used it already previously, into the park return".
Mayor Bloomberg places before the press clearly, that had been canceled based on this judicial arrangement the renewed opening of the place for the audience traffic and the demonstrators. It referred the demonstrators on that that the city laws did not permit them to arrange itself again with tents and sleeping bags at this place.
The mayor defended personally the clearance carried out in the daybreak of the Zuccotti place, with which almost 200 people were arrested, and that concluded became because the demonstrators violated" "the right.
Bloomberg explained, it would have given the arrangement to the clearance of the place because these "into a place changes had, at which the people not for demonstrating came, but rather for the breach of the laws and in some cases, around other people damage to add" itself, for "some businesses would have received" threats and were anxious the residents "around its quality of life".
"The clearance in the daybreak was disgusting and shows, that Bloomberg in the reason at the protection of the finance interests and not at the protection of the interests of the North American workers interested is", added the speaker of the movement, that the mayor accused "the press freedom to respect" not.
The responsibles of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they freely would render about that to organize "large actions" for the Thursday, and to be sure together with community organizations and labor unions to remember around the two months, that already have lasted the protests for the 17th of September now.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Weihnachtsshow the virgin Maria
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian fames, it will appear on the 1st of December in the TV program "it it a of Russell Peter Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim of all assistant in "home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the woman of the skirt musician Tommy lee and now the actress and model will be in a Christmas shipment of the Canadian distance marriage the virgin Maria.
The private TV canal CTV announced today that Anderson will appear together "it with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian fames on the 1st of December in the TV program it a of Russell Peter Christmas" and will breathe an entirely special virgin Maria life.
CTV spread today pictures of the television program, in which Anderson - that also for the distribution on the Internet an even turned porn, in which it together with its former husband, that percussion player of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy lee, appears - appears as a virgin Maria with a doll in the lap, whom Jesus should represent.
In the scene appears Peter, a well known Canadian commedian of Indian origin, that recently as a moderator in the shipment "My Violent torpedo worked of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, when Jesus child.
The Christmas program of CTV does not set stands not only on Anderson and Peter, in addition also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the end of March in Buenos Aires the Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato, and that of this controversy far.
Recently Bublé had designated the North American Kim Kardashian with one of its concerts in New York as a "whore".
Japan becomes after the earthquake reborn
The GDP are awake around 1.5% thanks to the inland consumption and concludes the spiral of the free if from beginning of March
For the last March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, that itself yet always in the recovery after the destructive earthquake, that flowed into an atom crisis, and the worst catastrophe, the Japan would be experienced had the 2nd world war.
The first estimations of the government in Tokyo of valued the property damages on 300,000 dollars, a blow, that itself in spite of the difficult world economic situation, to reduce seems.
After three quarters of lasting if the statements to the gross domestic product from July to September served in addition to lock finally this chapter: the GDP grew by 1.5% in comparison with the previous quarter and around 6% to the quota projected to the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan begins the fiscal year in March 2012 - means moreover the fastest growth since the period by January to March 2010.
The again upswing can devastated declared become partially zones by the machine sale to be the new construction of that of the earthquake and the following tsunami.
Actually the businesses raised its investments by 1.1% in comparison with the decline around 0.9% for investments, that were indicated by January to March, the first decline after six months of irresistible climbs.
Nevertheless the actual reversal of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively out of keynsianischen activating, that use the crisis in order to construct infrastructures or to construct newly.
Woke up is Japan especially thanks to the development the inland consumption, that presently 60% the Japanese BIPs settles.
This variable climbed around 1%, activated of the growing editions for vehicles, trips and leisure time employments.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has confides in after the yens - the Japanese currency - flee itself into one of the "refuge from the guilt crisis of the Eurozone and the dim prognoses for the U.S.A. from currencies" of the investors, that, a privilege, that weighs like a gravestone on the accounts of the export businesses, to the domestic market.
With a harder currency, the products are abroad more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based upon the health of the large technology maker.
Toyota and Sony for example its weak business results from July to September attributed to the notation of the yen.
During the markets also further the peripheral EU countries belagert, remains the government Yoshihiko Noda watchful.
"One must on the continuous risks pay attention, for example to the deterioration of some foreign economy, the effects of the inundations in Thailand and the fast upgrading of the yen", meant yesterday the Secretary of State for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The telescopes are really not very aufheiternd.
The organization for economic collaboration and development (OECD) explained that most member countries would have shown in September clearer indications of a slowdown of the economic development.
The indicator, that brought the turning points of the international economy before exceptional, at the light, that in the largest economy powers the brake would be pulled.
For it sank around four-tenth up to loosely 100.4 points in comparison with that 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone lies even beneath this average value, that is about 100, after it decreased around eight-tenth to 99.13 points.
Athens lets arise again doubt
Papadimos says, that dismissed would become savings measures, but the conservatives will sign no written agreement
With the risk premiums driven into the height of the peripheral countries and extend making uncertainty Greece gets lost itself also further in the maze that out of the large European guilt crisis leads out.
The impression that the "consent" of the new Greek transition government is sooner a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political powers, is covered slowly through facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, referred yesterday on that, that there would be no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the days arranged hundred in its appointment would be possibly too short for its conversion, assured of the leaders of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, that he support the new savings measures and in no case its demand of new choices to the planned date, that 19th of February would turn back.
"The most important task of this government is the conversion of the decisions, that on the summit of the 26th of October encountered became", assured Papadimos yesterday the opening of a parliamentary debate, that will reach tomorrow with the confidence vote for the new government its highpoint.
A package with 24 programs to the employment support, to the reform of the Disziplinarrechts for official and new measures against the tax evasion the first initiatives are.
Nevertheless Samaras communication does not clear the doubts about its bearing: "We have would obligate us to the support of the transition government, but otherwise to nothing".
The conservative leader went a step too far with its challenge of the EU and the IMF, that organism, that that 8000 million that Athens must urgently necessarily, entsperren. It placed clearly that it would approve of no declaration of obligations over the fulfillment of the savings measures.
But the European commission, that yet always is irritated because of the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, strengthened yesterday again, at its demand is not to be shake: The economy aid would not sign if the new government and the leaders of the most important Greek parties became not as soon as possible" sign "an agreement of unambiguous written.
The speaker of the Department of Commerce, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika would return to Athens "very soon" in order to discuss with the new government, "what kind of payment of the sixth section" in the amount of 8000 million Euro "necessary would be" although there is yet no final date.
The Greek Knäuel still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "Those are instruments for progress and hope"
The queen emphasized the "prevailing" position of Spain with regard to this financing type
Spain "reached" worldwide a prevailing position in the roll of the small financings.
The queen Sofía of Spain remembered yesterday that Spain had developed in the last two decades worldwide to the second donor for this means to the international collaboration. Whose "being" on that would rest that it would concern an "instrument for the social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for the entire humanity on the basis of the confidence in the person".
The queen dedicated yesterday the fifth world summit over small credit in Valladolid. It was convinced that there would be "no doubts", that this type of businesses would be "absolutely indispensable" in order to reach the year cable objectives stuck by the United Nations to the year 2015 and "especially the goal, the person number, that must live with income of less than a dollar at the day, therefore beneath the" poverty line".
Spain "works also further" at the expansion of the Begünstigtennetzes "into the last corner of the world and it leads this task responsibly through", noted the queen Sofia that hopes, that the initiatives and contributions that will go out by the summit, that lasts until Thursday, are guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better chances for the arms and especially for women" as a main favored of these loans.
"We indicated" and "stand many successes vis-à-vis" many challenges.
The summit over small credit is not only a forum for debates, but rather also a platform to the impetus of "these basic goals".
The queen explained, it would be striven for that until families poor toward the end the year 2015 175 million access should have to these finance services and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty line.
The philosophy of the small credit is due in Spain and the remaining world to the way" "years ago initiated by Muhammad Yunus, that the queen judges Sofia as an "act of the justice and recognition".
It described the father of this financing instrument as an "admirable idealist, prescribed would have" itself that the battle against poverty and has known its work it for 15 years when the queen traveled after Bangladesh in order to become acquainted with the loan strategy on the spot.
On this experience, a year followed later the first world summit in Washington and further meeting at the ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in the year 2006: With all, the queen, whose engagement brought in for this project its yesterday the judgment as a "family chief" in Valladolid and as a "champion of the arms", have "we a continuous further development observe can", declared.
In the end the queen Sofia concluded participate its presentation, in that it the presents to that in the debate and to the search for solutions in the battle against poverty animated.
"Ethical commandment"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez referred on that that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the entire democratic country.
In this sense emphasized it, it a mistake would be would concern to bind the economic aid at times of economic Booms then it a "durable obligation".
Jiménez was not of the opinion that the small credit one "serious and rigorous politics to the extermination of poverty would be", and that the governments of the industrial nations would have to work now "more then ever" after joint criteria, and allow might that the solidarity of the crisis falls victim.
For Spain, the small credit are one of the "most important forms of the economic aid".
To lend the Secretary of State for international collaboration, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success", "marginalized" person, "that always before locked doors stand" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, was named the presents in a city welcome, that "its gates, infected of the spirit of the solidarity" would open.
The Christian Democratic Union proposes to select the EU president based on general voting
The first day of the congress of the Christian democrats (Christian Democratic Union on Monday, that 14th of November in Leipzig passed for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairperson of the Christian democratic party, without actual difficulties.
The future of Europe was not planned originally in the program, but rather prevailed, especially around that activists would suffice to perform, in the autumn that estimate the government politics with respect to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The presidency proposal proposed by the presidency of the European commission almost unanimously was supposed.
Under 1001 delegated, solely nine had agreed on the other hand, ten had abstained from voting.
The Standing ovation continuous several minutes, that on the basis of its intervention directives first of all Angela Merkel counted as well as a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, on the part of the three Europes inclined Treasury Ministers no doubt at all openly.
The head idea of the chancellor carries - just as as the proposals - following slogan: the answer to the crisis does not read" fewer, but rather more Europe".
Because Europe means peace, but rather also there" nine million jobs direct of the Euro are dependent".
For the chancellor came" the time for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could come through a modification strengthening the inspection the European Union of the Lissabonner contract with respect to the budget politics of the countries in the Eurozone to the expression; just as this could flow however in the choice of the president of the European commission on basis of general voting" to lend a face around Europe".
This is however in any case one of the proposal suggestions dismissed by the congress which unambiguously Wolfgang stood Schäuble godfather.
Certainly it is only little probable that that 47 agree quickly on this revolution: Is stands the thing rejecting vis-à-vis, and to know believe the leading of the Christian Democratic Union that Nicolas Sarkozy of the same opinion is.
The milestone is put however.
Just as the delegated in an overwhelming majority rejected the suggestion of the weighting of each country in the EZB board of directors corresponding to the weighting of the single economy, what would entail obviously an Erstarkung of the position of Germany.
Chancellor considered reinforced that on calming of the climate within its party therefore the general reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. It tried however no longer to win its congress on costs of that" small" or the countries present European itself in difficulties, that would criticize immediately the arrogant Germany.
As far as the Europe proposal of the significance of that dedicates" friendship" a paragraph to German-French, Angela Merkel France does not call on the plan.
At least not directly.
For this remembers that Leipzig stood two centuries ago in the midpoint of a bloody battle.
Defeats of humbling in reality one the zuhöchst the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in offensive messages?
After the family aids, UMP and government take now the offensive messages in attack.
Nicolas Sarkozy will become on Tuesday, that 15th of Novembers in Bordeaux arrive, in order to search for a family aid cash register and to propose a speech over that - already since 2007 always recurring - subject of the battle against social fraud as well as economic dependence of the country.
In order to accompany this attack, that comes from the endeavoring to subject the economy in a hardness sample, on which other side represents however not more little precursor of an axis of the right presidency campaign, the majority wants to concentrate on employee offensive messages.
First of all with household economic goal: the government the introduction of a fourth Karenztages envisages before consideration of an offensive message with employees in the private sector.
On well German this means that a sick employee would lose the wage without permission of the specific firm of four days, therefore therefore at least 15% of its monthly income.
To conjure up one that according to the daily newspaper" harvest echoes" wrath threatens help would become, however in addition to bring in 280 million Euro.
And that with another rather symbolic character along would go: to clear the country official an unvergüteten Karenztag in the illness trap (until now gives it for it, in contrast to the three Karenztagen in the private sector, NO Karenzfrist at all).
In the meantime these questions in the discussion stand, kindles the majority also of new the Betrugsthematik whereby this time on the abuse connected with Arbeitsabsenz aimed becomes.
"Inspections substantially will be more important, and in addition are this to refund, if this demanded becomes", warned Xavier pray edge on Sunday, the 13th of November before the microphone of the transmitter RTL.
How also in other cases the effects of this message seem with respect to reality of deceitful actions in the area of the offensive messages a little unproportioniert.
This is in the deed already since 2002 objects of permanent observation as well as more political offensives, that carried most frequently fruits.
The Frenchmen are no longer more frequent sick as people other plotted in Europe.
Let's linger however first of all in the nationwide figures.
Loud the country health insurance company CNAM more were paid in 2006 than 237 million Euro day settlements.
The day settlements in 2008 with 11.3 billion represented the economic research institute and documentation institute of public health Euro of 5% the medical expenses.
Under this sum, 46% regarding motherhood vacation as well as work accidents and 54% concerning sick leave, that 6.2 billions of Euro fell.
And accordingly 2.5% medical expense.
In 2010, on the average only 14.5 sick days were accrued the Frenchman vis-à-vis the 17.8 days per years 2009 according to a study of the Alma Consulting group.
An average that glosses over certain differences: another, in 2007 of monster. com, website for career planning, publishes became, showed up that 75% of the 40th 000 questioned to have taken French employee indicated, no single sick day.
Another study grasped this time by the health insurance places clearly that 37% of the offensive messages in 2010 of shorter duration were than a 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and and 11% about that to three months.
Compared to tend its European neighbor the French employees therefore no longer as elsewhere to disability.
One in long-term study led 2010 by two researchers the French, national center for science research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global Absenzquote (illnesses or other established) oscillated, and to be sure in France between 10% and 11% contrary to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the united kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in offensive messages represents a disappearing slight share with respect to the illicit work.
Regarding the fraud, only a weak is reached here.
The confirmation of the legislation since 2002 has entailed that there are systmatische inspections in offensive messages, that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for education and continued education of technicians and engineers) assessed under 1.5 million inspections that 13% of that 285,000 of the realized, short-term offensive messages that were in 37,050 cases", unjustified or too long".
In the systematically controlled offensive message cases of more than 45 days duration one counted under 1.2 million 11% at" maladjusted or unjustified" cases, that 132,000.
Altogether this makes therefore 169.000"ungerechtfertigte" cases on several millions employee who made an offensive message validly.
A figure that represents only a weak vis-à-vis for example that one the illicit work.
According to the UMP delegate Dominique Tian, author of a special report appeared in July with respect to this question, represents this between 9 and 15 billion Euro tax profit loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost at day compensation, and therefore substantially more than the Defraudation in last-named.
Papa demoes: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece has a new adaptation program for the interception of its economy compel.
This had on Monday, that 14 Novembers of the prime ministers Lucas announces papa demoes before the parliament under joining of the fact, that the days cleared one hundred its government on the part of the union did not suffice in order to settle this task.
"Around the efforts toward an Erstarkung of the economy continue to can, require we support of our European partners as well as a new program to the budget adaptation", explained the head of the government in its first public speech in the Eröffung of the debate over the confidence vote of the parliament on Wednesday.
The conversion of that on the occasion of the Euro summit meeting on the 27th of October made would be decisions that" head task" the new government because the cooperation of the country would stand within the Eurozone" on the game", how it added.
Correspondingly M has. papa demoes planned to sink the country deficit of the country" about 9%" the gross domestic product of today to the end of the year after this in 2010,10.6% and in 2009 was about 15.7%.
The rights rejects the new
Antonis Samaras, boss of the right wing, had on Monday its approval to the already approved with respect to one the escaping out of the guilt crisis of serving attempt given, however sent ahead that its party would not become itself an additional ready erkären.
"We become not for the benefit of more newly vote", said it on the occasion of a delegate meeting of its party new democracy.
He had explained himself with the specification of the reduction of budget deficit and guilt ready, just as as to the battle against the waste, stood stop would become to be sure jedweder politics hostily vis-à-vis, that the economy upswing.
Olli deer, with economy task and currency task of entrusted EU Kommisar, that had prevented, that IMF and EU do not release the necessary loan over 8 billion Euro without written guarantee of all parties over its support of the planned, had answered Antonio Samaras that its word would suffice and it would sign nothing under pressure of.
Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalizeed, such an expert group
The Canadians live in denial of death how out of a report of the royal company of Canada follows
The group explained that governments to place collaborated, institutions of the hygiene and physicians with respect to analgesic treatment around the best analgesic means ready, and this also over the cancer cases going out.
The Canadian company lives in a denial bearing vis-à-vis death.
Only 9% of the Canadians admit die would want and meet actually on that to speak with its physician over conditions, under which it dispositions to this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report the royal company of Canada at which six experts were involved, who are connected on different areas of expertise, among other things ethics, right and medicine, together.
This group recommends the government to alter the criminal law so, in order to permit accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice stands, and to make to be sure with patients, who are looked at as in a position, such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts quote a survey published recently of the independent company EIU that had compared the death quality in 40 countries of the globe together.
Although Canada placed itself herewith on the 10th rank, the study notes that "the medical dead care in Canada produced a culture, in which the people have anxiety to cut" the subject of death.
Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to analgesic means, report ordered that of the royal company of Canada experts to us.
And in spite of the majority wish of the Canadians to die at home, die however in the end 68.6% of this in the hospital.
Of the entire country here observed the rate with 86% is at deaths entered in the hospital in the Quebec most highly.
In the delicate question regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report to conclusions come, that of the position of the federal government which already has to want no changes at all of the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide of distinguished, arranged contrary to are.
Now however there is loudly the expert who inspected all those countries, whose extension legalizes euthanasia and accompanied suicide or have entkriminalisiert, no proof at all that such an Entkriminalisierung would not stretch into its application, therefore the practice execution of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of unkompetenten or consenting people after.
To the contrary meet substantially more cases of such infraction just in the countries, in which euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalizeed, how yesterday Jocelyn Downie, cosigner of the report confirmed, in a videophone conference.
"Euthanasia becomes in Canada where it is unambiguously illegal, practice".
"Also accompanied suicide becomes in Canada practice, although here unambiguously illegally", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians advocate the euthanasia
Let's imagine that loudly one in 2010 carried out Angus-Reid-surveys of already 85% the Canadians for the benefit of the euthanasia had itself, because they are of the opinion, this would allow us it people at the end of its journey through life to soften its sorrows.
And 66% believe that the circumstance of a legalization of the euthanasia would not have as a consequence to mediate the message that life of older or hindered people less value.
With respect to the people, who have already an accompanied suicide practice, the questioned represent the opinion to 41% that these should be pursued not criminal.
What concerns maintenance or attitude of the means with patients, represents itself situation as fewer clearly, so the authors of the report.
Just as these in its recommendation index suggest that in the criminal law indicated become should, that the dropping of the means, for which a legal rejection had produced, should not count, as criminal.
The expert group demands in addition that specialists of public health should be educated in the task of respecting a dropping of the means at the end of life, and this without criminal pursuit fear to must.
The group explained that governments, institutions of the hygiene and physicians collaborated with respect to analgesic treatment in order to place the best analgesic means ready, and this also over the cancer cases going out.
Finally the group with respect to the means long-range used already in the Canadian institutions to the hygiene to pain relief or this demands to pull at least in deliberation because these served just as few like the euthanasia in addition to reduce physical pains and this on the same procedures would relate themselves.
Reserve other experts
Some experts on the right zone of public health proposed already reservations with respect to the conclusions of the expert report of the royal company of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health right, has the bearing of the report lower drawing experts among other things as" extremely" designated, suffer would set because these the euthanasia practice in in the final stages no boundaries at all.
"This opens the gates for a situation, in that each, that suicidal and older than a 18 years is, another person to ask, it in its suicide helpful to be", so RA Deschamps that yesterday a summary of the report had looked through.
RA Deschamps emphasizes also, the authors of the report seemed to place the individual responsibility of the single over all other values, that are involved in the social Gewirke of the company.
Now however, says it, would give it" guidelines and obligations in a company".
Margaret Somerville, specialist for health right, expressed also" a strong resistance" vis-à-vis the conclusions of the report, that called it as" per-euthanasia-manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, that is even member of the royal company of Canada, does not dispute especially the report statement regarding the model of abuses in certain countries, in which euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalizeed, like for example in the Netherlands and in Oregon.

Entry one" golden household rule" into the constitution
The government present itself in Austria at the power of the sozialdemokratischen/christdemokratischen coalition concluded on Tuesday to include one" golden household rule" in the constitution, in order to reduce public deficits and to avoid also a possible Degradation on the part of Rating agencies in the Top of creditworthiness Austria (AAA).

Noda threatens with a new intervention on the currency markets
The Japanese prime minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday before that that the Japanese office force would intervene again on the currency markets, if the yen should climb further.
We "should assess an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen", we will intervene just as, done have it like we the last time", explained M. Noda in the senate.
On Tuesday the yen was again near to the historic levels aufgeschnellt, that the Japanese authorities had forced on the 31st of October for intervening.
This day Tokyo had sold massively yen against dollar in order to sink the Japanese foreign currency value, that is there, to head a new record value since 1945 vis-à-vis the dollar for.
The yen climbed however about that, gedopt through purchases of investors, that look at the yen as a "refuge value" in these unsteady times of international economy downswing and indebtedness crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell on Tuesday under 77 yens, the Euro is slipped under the symbolic slat of 105 yens into the vicinity of the levels, that had the last intervention getriggert.
Before the finance crisis 2008-2009 more noted of the dollars about 120 yen, the Euro more than 160 yens.
This straw fire of the Japanese foreign currency damages marks up and reduces the exports of the archipelago, because it the costs of that" maggot in Japan" -products the income value pulled by Japanese firms out of foreign countries because these exchange this it in local currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake as well as the tsunami on the 11th of March, that the region Tohoku (northeast) devastates have, for its reconstruction", emphasizes M. Noda that fears, this increase in prices of the yen could kill the weak upswing already in the germ.
The third economy world power won "plombierten" households with the growth in the third quarter -1.5% in comparison with the preceded quarter for the first time this year thanks to the jerky export increase and the consumption of that through the catastrophe again at pulling power.
The prime minister appreciates however that the increase in prices of the yen would not reflect" the economical foundations of Japan".
The Treasury Minister Jun American opened has for its part the bank of Japan (BoJ), that on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its currency political committee, requested in addition to seize all imaginable, in order to weaken the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, set however about that in knowledge, the BoJ had initiated already" suitable wherewith he let disclose, that on Wednesday no additional currency loosening is to be expected.
On the occasion of the last meeting the end of October the central bank had raised its country bond purchases by 5,000 billion yens (47 billions of Euro) to delete about 55,000 billions of yen (519 billions of Euro) cover sums, that it had spent for different purchases of finance title, in order to inundate the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interests rates of fast into the height, stock exchanges backing down make
The contagion risk of the guilt crisis undermines steadily the European indices.
In spite of the office reception of the new heads of the government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened Länders climb steadily further on.
The stock exchanges, that are provided still around the stability of the Eurozone, drift also this Tuesday, the 15th of November another few more into negative Gefilde off.
In Paris, the CAC at 10 o'clock 1.4% lost and fell on 3,064 points.
The Daxes in Frankfurt returned around 0.4%, London around 0.1%.
"Based on the new tensions regarding the yield of the government bonds in the Eurozone present itself in difficulties the worldwide stock markets continue to publish a part its recently profits.
"The investors are nervous and itself only too good the contagion risk aware", explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker in Industrial Trade Union it noticed, quotes through the press agency Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo, that suffers on their part from the renewed fear of the market participants with respect to the capacity in Europe, that the guilt crisis would last further, had closed with a fall of 0.7%.
"" Japan has just as as arranged the remainder of the world its eyes on Europe, and the trade moves on limited variation corridor as long as the investors have no proofs, that itself the situation stabilized has", appreciates Mitsushige Akino, fund administrator in Ichiyoshi Investment management.
This revival of the apprehension about the future of the Eurozone damages the unit currency that continues its Baiss on on Tuesday.
The Euro has moved for one and a half months on its lowest level.
Shortly before 10 o'clock the European currency was gave way 1,3570 Doller valued, it therefore around 0.4%.
Loud the stockbroker it returned after the Christian Democratic Union, party of the chancellor Angela Merkel, that had met itself on Monday in the congress, had granted a proposal, that plans especially the possibility for itself in difficulties present countries, to withdraw from the Eurozone, without left simultaneously the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far under the 6%-Grenze.
The loan interests of Italy and Spain is further on very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning reached ripened the yield of the Italian bond on 10 years 6.85%, that one the Spanish titles on 6.2% up to.
These tensions of the interest rates in the south countries, but also in France, nourish further the fears of the investors.
The future Italian head of the government Mario Monti called for of the markets more time in order to produce the situation threatened by paralysis through the indebtedness in Italy again.
The new Greek prime minister Lucas papa demoes had confirmed for its part, made were the conversion of that on the occasion of the at the 27th of October summit meeting of the Eurozone decisions" the head task" its government.
Spain is in the Visir of the markets because on Sunday the parliament choices will take place in the country.
The interest scissors ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-Jahres-Obligationen 10-Jahres-Obligationen years 10-Jahres-Obligationen bond highly reached again a new, historic.
In expectation of growth numbers of the Eurozone
Statistically an economic growth carried by the household consumption of 0.4% in the third quarter, ergo seen expected booked France a little better than that 0.3%.
The Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised to be sure the fall of the numbers of the second quarter, and to be sure with a minus of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in place of a stagnation.
In truth, it is the fourth quarter that the economy experts disturbs most.
Germany had for its part a growth of 0.5% over the same period to indicate.
A first projection of the entire Eurozone is expected at 11 o'clock whereby the EU commission warns against the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy politics:
Facts should win over dogmas
If a subject exists that on basis by short-term views or on the basis of emotions treated will not may, this is certainly the energy politics.
Availability and costs of the electricity influence the buying power as well as the competitive stature of the businesses in direct.
It is sensible to take a choice meeting to the occasion, to think about this subject as well as over the position of the atomic energy.
The debate will carry only then fruits if it probes the entirety of more economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed option.
The Frenchmen should underpin its opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billions of person are on this planet, the demographic evolution pushes a doubling of the electricity demand to the year 2050, should forgo must not an enormous share of the world population a vital element.
Simultaneously one must soften the shortage of the fossilized resources in order to be able to produce further steadily electricity, without forgetting the compelling necessity to the reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions, a subject disappeared out of the ecological debate,, in order to struggle against climatic.
The accident of Fukushima changes no this parameter.
Therefore blebt Germany further in its decision isolates to forgo nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, that subjects its decision of the necessity, of finding a substitutionsfähige replacement source, yet in Switzerland, that intends just once only nuclear power plants of the last generation to construct.
Finland, Poland, the Czech republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil in order to name only some countries, pursue its projects on the other hand further with determination.
The United States concluded would paint take on their part after Fukushima to incorporate its park a further unit, in that it the work shut down after the atom accident Three Iceland again in operation.
Also if the model directed, German on renewable energy sources is placed occasionally as an example, reality contradicts however the discourse.
The choice in Berlin will find expression in form of an increase of the electricity price, a dependence reinforced energetic by the increased recourse to import gas especially of Russia, a climb of that of CO2-Emissionen caused by gas power plants and coal power plants.
The entirety of these unpleasant effects noticeably will make itself already within less months.
The case Denmark gives occasion for meditation.
Denmark is on the one hand European table leader with respect to wind power, out of which it relates 30% of its electricity, on the other hand the country of one of the strongest users of coal and gas is used, alternating with wind power; aufgrunddessen are its CO2-Ausstösse as well as its electricity price respectively around 65% and 50% higher than the average value corresponding European.
Thanks to the constancy of our energy politics, our neighbors pay one in contrast to our French households around 40% higher electricity calculation.
Because the energy price in the globalized economy represents a key roll of the competitive stature as well as a Stabilitätspfand of the industry on national ground, the französichen businesses have an advantage based on the most favorable electricity in Europe.
Each significant reduction regarding the nuclear power would stretch therefore a strong growing of the energy price after, what let say become the noble about the Reindustrialisierung of our country and the defense of the buying power the illusion.
Surveys yielded that that would be a price to pay that the majority of the Frenchmen just as few ready is how it lets recognize resistance against the principle of this energy source.
Let's imagine us that the energy politics of our country enabled it to construct a branch of industry jobs direct and 410,000 induced with 125.00.
Based on its strong export character, it brings an enormous quantity of specialized small and middle-class businesses on the international markets and makes this of jobs innumerable to creators.
If France should grasp the decision to get off of the nuclear power, would fall victim that a this KMU, and the annual 6 billions of Euro at capital goods export and atomic energy export would dwindle more and more.
Which electrician would delegate an EPR conceived for functioning on sixty years if the decline of its maker is preprogrammed?
To solve around the energetic equation one must clear that there is just as few a like a devil work a miracle means to the production of electricity.
That of the firm Areva developed, CO2-armen solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy witness of the complementarity of the energy sources.
To received the highest possible security level uprightly an absolute imperative is for the nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent inspections in already existing works such as for example at the building in Flamanville.
Whose work teams, that made itself based on its professionalism a name, are of the security presentation just to possessed.
Within 50 years, the kernel industry experienced three serious disturbances.
Only a more only, and to be sure in Three Iceland would paint, entered under normal operating conditions; so it passed without consequences for person and environment.
In Tschernobyl, the drama through reactor construction as well as unendschuldbares, human failure was conjured up.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident never was evoked by two natural disasters existence size, that caused death of several ten thousand people.
The kernel industry will pull its apprenticeships just as out of this accident how it had done according to this both preceded.
As a fruit of this procedure as well as a cooperation of the security authorities the French and German operators and designer of nuclear power plants, represents the EPR a design, that enables it robustness vis-à-vis such phenomena.
Because it is considered under the electrical engineer as desirable, to build a nuclear power plant, a building stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift at the competition of Areva and EDF in that one would let them clear track to tear the lead in the unavoidable nuclear power development at itself.
It is indispensable and legitimate to search for the best Energiebouquet for our country, however it would be irresponsible, emotions let dominate dogmas and Parteimanöber a debate, the just as economic, social and financial situation of our country determiniert.
Is immigration load or chance for the economy?
The immigration politics led under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized out of angles multifarious - overload by police organs, court organs and administration organs based on a politics subjected to the numbers, compatibility of this politics with the status one "country of the human rights" how France itself had entitled itself.
Recently the annoyance arranged against foreign students by official side had stamped the newsreel, had announced the Secretary of the Interior incidentally (see Libération of the 23rd of May), compel would have that France" no talents, mason or waiter out of foreign countries".
But this politics became only rarely of the economical viewpoint out of analyzed.
Over this subject, a long-range consent between rights and left rules namely.
Of right side, the tone was struck of Jacques Chirac, represent might that 1976 had explained, that" the 900,000 unemployed, under that over 2 million immigrated labor forces, no problem for a country", by left side by Michel Rocard, that 1990 had represented, France" the entire poverty of the world could not receive".
Only difference exists in the degree of that
The fear of the invasion of the national ground through hordes of Polish plumber was divided in 2005 both of to the right and of to the left.
Of both warehouses, the immigrants were perceived as a load for the economy and the French company.
The single difference exists to admit is in that just that that one vis-à-vis the immigrants willing.
Francois get countries is restricted would permit in its program to banality, that refer on that, based on partnership development it to solve our" migration problems".
This presentation of immigration as a load when problem, can affect possibly the choices; however is it economically costly.
How the economy experts imagine us Ian gold and Geoffrey Cameron in a work appeared recently, that the newest insights regarding the immigration summarizes (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our world and wants Define Our future, May 2011, Princeton University of press, 352 S.), existed under the specialist a wide consent with respect to the positive influence of the immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
To restrict the immigration the growth would weaken and would damage the labor market situation.
The fears vis-à-vis the influence of the migrants are based on the presentation that these threaten to replace the domestic labor forces, especially that more slightly qualified, in that they exerted pressure on its wages.
The experience shows however that the immigrants in truth are substantially more complementary than as the domestic laborers, because they exercise occupations in sectors, that are job technical not at full capacity.
The slightly qualified immigrants work work in sectors, that domestic laborers excite few, the more qualified under the immigrants in dynamic sectors, in which the education is not adjusted the work offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as as a surgeon difficulties have would become to work in a country, in which a lack rules of anesthesiologists, this complementarity causes also a positive effect of the Einwandererzuzugs between domestic and migrant on wages and domestic labor market situation.
Giovanni Peri calculated on this type and manner that a 1 %- iger climb of the immigrant flood would induce a with included, long-term increase of the real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without consideration of the fact that the variety brought in by the immigrants of the idea creation as well as the economic growth is beneficial (high share of naturalized immigrants under American noble prize winner; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBAY and Yahoo became of immigrants established).
The migrants contribute also net to the social systems, in the European countries on average about in a height of 1% of the entire household.
The world work organization appreciates for example that a person immigrating at the age of 30 years to Germany brings in the public household in the average over its lifetime a net contribution (revenue minus editions) by about 150,000 Euro.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to induce the missing intersections to start of its mandate" with the teeth".
These purported teeth that the immigrants should deter obtained however exactly the contrary effect.
Europe invented the democracy, remains now to think out the European democracy
Democracy is some valuable goods; also some sensitive goods.
The European continent is supposed to be able to remember on that, who had issue let the entire 20th century after its invention in the Athens before more than two thousand years over the tragedy of the first world war, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the colonel in Greece over itself.
Some's probably had believed, it rich from to exercise the right to vote, and to be sure on most directly possible type and manner in order to see be victorious the democracy a for all times over its enemies.
One knows since Napoleon" the small" that it concerned a feature of the spirit bearing.
The general right to vote, that represents necessary condition of the democracy, is for this not sufficient condition and can become just as good that" suppression instrument" how it at that time the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed.
No, democracy requires by far more: a public room, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and inspection of the forces, an education, clarification, economic and social partnership spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, in which we find us, is an economic crisis, but it is just as very and first of all politics crisis and democracy crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek Wahr-incorrectly-referendum would have had doubly informative character in this regard: once that of the necessity of a powerful return the politics, on the other side however also that the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its impropriety.
This ambivalence should be considered as outdated.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle shifted themselves today, and that the republican soldiers aim, or at least that of them, no longer into the correct direction.
We have nothing to win in order to press on a success of the domestic referendum, which was organized in dependence of the necessities and in wrong sequence.
A free certificate for the European alone ruler or a leap with connected eyes into the void of the nationalistic withdrawal: A choice for the citizen!
No, we want hoe hatchet, but rather a collective task, out of full right, clarified and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time on European level.
There are gives no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one knows in the remaining already no longer, where the list to conclude - there it only a single crisis, and this rules in Europe.
It is entirely Europe, that bends itself the dictation of the markets and the Ratingagenturen, that suffers from its faint and its solidarity deficiency.
It is entire Europe that is humbled on more international plain.
One is disturbed over sovereignty transfer toward Europe - at the same time is it entire Europe that loses gradually its sovereignty, and therewith each single of the nations incorporated it.
The urgency exists therein to give the sovereignty of the people of the leadership of the European project back at the hand.
For it is lain at the entirety whether the Europeans reduce the load of its guilt, of the markets freely make itself and develop can a future by investments.
The exit out of the crisis has decisions on European level to the condition, that does not please will can without total democratic, without leading us very certainly into the ruining.
After this suggestion was fought by Jacques Delors and the socialist long time over, every presses today the European economy leadership in addition.
Agreed.
To imagine but this without political integration and a stronger democracy - like it the citizens floats before -, a renewed folly and a further dead end would be.
We must take a new stage of European construction on us.
In order let emerge in France the republic, needed it the fact to "to create" republican.
The revolution of the interests alone could not would suffice perform here.
This instruction remains further valid.
We must form an on Europe better integrated more economically plain.
This only can be reached, politically seen creates in that one a more democratic Europe, a genuinely European sovereignty of the people.
We need European in order to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become the all common property
The world fair for chip cards will open on Tuesday near Paris in optimistic bearing in Villepinte its gates.
The year 2011 should end according to Eurosmart actually with a 11 %- igen increase of worldwide Verkäufe of microprocessor chip (EC cards, SIM-cards-telephone), sold units with more than 6 billions.
Segments carrying is that herewith the contactless technology, that enables payments in public transportation or settlement of purchases, in that one holds very simply the card at a harvest device.
Opposite that a year previously sold 320 million chip cards less 460 million contactsshould be sold this year worldwide!
Your market share should increase in 2012 yet further (580 million expected units) and over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards) represent.
Europe wins with respect to the contactless payment at ground after it is long time of the region Asia Pacific afterwards lame.
Some 26 million visas cards are equipped already with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept this.
In France, the beginnings of rather modest are: Only 400,000 contactless visa cards were spread.
The consumer markets make however steam.
Carrefour issued therefore this year passport less 2.5 million contactsMasterCards.
In order to pass over to higher speed, it is now necessary that the banks its customers with these cards equip.
"Two French financial institutions have itself in addition obligates, its customer in the future systematically bank cards to issue, that with contactless chip equipped are", gives notice Gérard Nébouy, general director of visas Europes France on.
Banks test payment per mobile phone
That is however only a first step on the way to the currency of the future: the mobile phone.
A disappearing slight percentage at devices is equipped until now with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) necessary to the execution this transaction.
"You ran" in delay.
"But they should learn" at least next year a real upwards development.
"We reckon in 2012 with the sale of 80 until 120 million units worldwide", explains Marc Bertin, chairperson of Eurosmart.
But the banks seize initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test course in Caen, that will expire from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and colleague are supposed to be equipped with a capsule, that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société Générale had stated yesterday to prepare the launch of an offer, that enables its customer payment contactless per mobile phone.
Terrorist front understands itself, of which Sahara until to Nigeria
Paris is disturbed over the relations between al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The already long relations standing under suspicion between the terrorist group al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday the Algerian Abdelkader Messahel itself had confirmed that Algier would have now about that" certainty attained".
"The type and manner, with that both organizations advance as well as the relations of the secret services point at a clear collaboration there" to go declared it without further into the detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The ascertainments over the kidnapping taken place in the last January of these Frenchmen in the Niger days had promoted interfaces too.
The Antoine kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by followers the Aqmi de Léocour and Vincent Delory should have been killed at the subsequent day to the same time such as several of its abductors on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators claim to have found several telephone chips in the ruins at the use place, that belonged to the terrorist.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the led phone calls leads to several interlocutors, who are stationed in Mali, in the Niger as well as in Nigeria.
According to radio France international (RFI) the investigators interest especially the numbers of these interlocutors: A number leads himself to a Nigerian, who long time in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, that cradle of Boko Haram had delayed; the other leads to a man, who counts as the Aqmi and the sect nearly standing.
"This is a progress, one must await however doubtless more unambiguous records before one can" speak about a strategic collaboration between Aqmi and Boko harem.
"It is to be sure conceivable".
"One knows since years, that the sect financial and intellectual support of relates and that this itself increasingly actively shows", softens the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo off.
In these last months, these had become more and more" support achievements" in its course obviouser, carry just as the talks as well as the operation modes of Boko harem, that point out now the consulting of suicide attempts as well as the use of explosive materials more complexly becoming always, that the same handwriting like that, that were used by Aqmi.
The international partnership in order to begin in Washington, exerted since this moment pressure on Abuja so that one takes into account there for the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have the grouping in the deed long time over as a partnership of Illuminaten considered, that no special attention would have to be given.
Fast success
That in 2002 in Maiduguri in environment of a mosque, a school as well as the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf established Boko Haram - what in Haoussa so much meant like" the western upbringing is a shame" - pursues the erection of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the amalgamation learns rapid successes.
It politicizes herself and claims strict compliance of the shariah while that intervene its activists incorporated in the battle against the godless central government.
The activists have first of all churches, bars and authorities in the visor.
2009 the activists of Boko Haram with its reinforced attacks against the commissioner's offices appeared especially on.
The reaction on the part of Abuja is however usual like indifferenziert.
The army surrounds the city, one counts 800 dead.
The Mohammed Yusuf taken in captivity is killed in the prison.
As a result the sect becomes visibly more radically and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas acknowledged it an attempt in Jos, that 80 human lives demanded, then to a further in Abuja.
In June Boko Haram is shown the guilt of a suicide attempt, happened that in the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its type.
In August the local seat of the United Nations to the priority international target runs.
The development of a terrorist axis in Africa, that should lead of Mauretanien over Nigeria until there to Somalia, disturbs since then all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Nigers occupied, that Somalis of al Shabaab in Kenya operate, Boko harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week hatta Alain Juppé on the occasion of a conversation with Präsident Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria before Boko harem warned and appeared ready" to announce all references".
The world of the republican presidency candidates
Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry avoided compete in Simplifizierung and ignorance regarding China, Iraq as well as the aid position for Israel.
Can a crisis weakened America not lead a complex world with simple to say around: naive ideas?
If one listens so to the republican presidency candidate, the voters could get almost this impression.
Since some days let avoided Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and its comrade-in-arms its thundering explanations as well as its Statements regarding that focal point traditional republican, repeatedly disclose.
Over China, the Iran and the Israel aid fall - frequently in keinster manner bolstered - slogans.
That with respect to the appointment of the "Grand Old party" most highly in the course standing Romney avoided threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and to accuse it that" currency manipulation" - leading subject in an America, that through the migration of entire branches of industry to Asia on that excited is -.
Stupidly run if this should imply the initiating of a trade war, said it.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama and only candidate, who seems to have a matured vision of, untied themselves nearly with respect to its behavior flattering the emotions the air.
It had called to a strong, but constructive conversation exchange with Beijing (also the current bearing Obamas).
But Huntsman is not granted because it stagnates in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's it likeness
Romney had praised also military blows against the Irans if the sanctions should fail to the Stoppung of the nuclear program.
"If I selected would become, command I the Iran restraint", had tinted it.
Obama "is re-elected, they get the bomb".
It promised Israel aid reinforced military and accused Obama to have remained vis-à-vis obligations indebted to this partner.
A disgraceful act ignorance to the show the entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest placed candidate, carries for its part.
Recently it called would try in addition to give the Chinese military threat Kontra, there Beijing" to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to let at the same time the fact eight that China has been already since 1964 in the possession more militarily atomic weapons!
To be the Texan governor Rick Perry, that Israel supports and military blows against the Irans demands, for its part, in addition ready, to take the American army in Mexico against drugs cartels in service.
That of Obama 2009 prohibited recourse to vis-à-vis terrorist Michele stream man was advocated also of Cain, Perry as well as the candidate ions.
One far is removed of John McCain, the republican candidate in 2008, a heavy-weight.
The current presidency contractors toward, Reagan had had also simple presentations and had won the cold war in spite of all that.
They call in memory that also Obama selbstein amateur would be and had to give water into its wine, what concerned the subject anti-terrorist.
They persist to right on the fiasco of its naive dialogue with the Iran, the hasty deduction its" boy" out of Iraq, its irresolution in Libya what brought in it also the call of the weakness.
This Anfeindung is to be sure not very so unconstrained.
The population appreciates am turned off has sooner the positive balances of the national security under Obama, that store.
Since Iraq, she is wary of military interventions, that lead to the Erlahmen.
And Obama surprises more appropriate in that it argues, America economically would have to be reconstructed in order to awake its lead to new life.
North Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The gas pipeline north Stream, that passes on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects the western Europe directly with Russia, was set in operation.
It should gas for an equivalently of 30 million households deliver.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with brightness and Gloria.
Over 500 loaded guests, under that four heads of state and heads of the government, attended last Tuesday at the Baltic Sea coast under Orchesterbeschallung and in Feinschmeckerbuffet the inaugural of the new gas pipeline north Stream, that interconnects Russia and Germany below sea level directly.
The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, that Russian Präsident Dmitri Medwedew, the French prime minister François Fillon as well as its office colleague mark Rutte out of the Netherlands have symbolic would prove the tax the valve jointly turned, which conveys the Russian gas into the west european network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billions of cubic meter of additional Russian gas are supposed to be delivered by a first piping of 1,224 km lengths, that connects the region Saint Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, to Western Europe per year.
A second piping, that allows an entire delivery of 55 billion cubic meters gas - that equivalently the French entire consumption - is supposed to be placed end 2012 ready.
And one lets be discernable already the eventuality of the building of a third direction on self stretch.
For Gazprom, the timely and point exact completion of this enormous building such as a victory causes.
The project was strongly disputed in Poland and the Baltic countries.
The north-Stream-pipeline will enable namely a direct gas delivery to Germany, and to be sure under avoidance of each line course through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the country way.
For this reason lose both countries a few of its power: For it, it becomes now more difficult to exert pressure on Russia in that they threaten to close the access to west european markets.
Warsaw, most strongly in the debate engages, was not before that back shy to compare the north-Stream-pipeline to a "new German sowietischen pact" in involvement at the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means, politically seen is that the subject sensitive.
Western Europe won an even higher provision security through the approval of this Russian project.
This however on costs of a debility of European energy because the project struck a breach between west European and east European.
Russia brought it in hardly five years ready, its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and that pass to put through western countries, that show strong gas consumption and whose gas occurrence draws to a close.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery, that us on organic type and manner connects", confirmed are important François Fillon in the inaugural of the gas pipeline in that it referred on that, in which straight the gas contracts also of political and economic side.
All this declared the wide smile of the Gazprom manager represented in Lubmin in great numbers with respect to the gas pipeline.
The building of this gas pipeline is also an exceptional technology.
The lower water pipe consists of steel with concrete casing, that should protect it against Schiffsankern.
It rests on the seabed, in approximately 200 ms depth.
In its building had to be avoided out of the second world war dating mine fields.
"About hunderte mines as a precaution had to remove or destroyed become", gave Jens Müller, speaker of the company north Stream, on.
Reinforced had to be seized to the protection of the fauna and Flora.
The direction is a long snake out of metal, heavily like 242 Eiffeltürme, that is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither through valves, yet maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned before the coast of Sweden, but the project responsible took therefrom distance because the Sweden were eager few on that to see establish themselves a Russian country company on permanent type and manner on height of its coasts.
"In the case a loss by sea close we the gas passage in less than a minute", specified Jens Müller.
In the case a leak, the gas present itself in the gas pipeline escapes therefore into the air.
This case probably is looked at of the designers however as only few because that was estimated to be a constancy by a leak per 100,000 years.
The national supervision of the gas pipeline becomes both guarantees of a lower water robot, that is driven to external Observationszwecken by a lake ship out of, how also of a device, that circulates in the interior of the gas pipeline.
It possesses the form of a cigar, a meter of diameter, is introduced the piping in that in and moves away through the gas pressure.
After three complete days of the locomotion through the direction in a speed of 3 meters per second, delivers the device information most exact in its arrival about possible deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was conceived subjected become in order to function for fifty years, without so much as the slightest repair to must.
The gas circulation is guaranteed very simply through pressure.
This amounts to 200 cash at the access, 100 cash at the exit point.
Five companies united its powers to the realization of this project.
The direction leadership remains however in the hand of Gazprom, that holds 51% of the shares.
Further the German companies are incorporated here E. ON and BASF (ever to 15,5%), just as as the Dutch gas university and the French firm group GDF suez (ever to 9%).
These five companies formed a business partnership, that names itself north Stream and that is delegated with the building as well as business of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland where the taxation is especially favorable.
Gazprom rented then this company the entire capacity of its gas carrier, and to be sure on verlängerbaren twenty-year-contract.
"Gazprom becomes for the entire capacity pay, equal like that honestly would transport gas quantity precipitates", specified Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline building was protected to 30% of stockholders as well as to 70% through bank lending.
The entire cost of labor should amount to itself on 7.4 billion Euro for both pipings.
For GDF suez the investment sum amounted to for example 240 million.
The minority stockholders are to be overtaken here themselves however its expense again because Gazprom carries alone the liability risk.
The gas pipeline steps at a sandy coast stroke wooded with jaws in Lubmin out of the Baltic Sea to light.
Valves high the 4.5 meters form the gas retirement gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and further indices of the arriving gas before this is forwarded into the German gas pipelines.
For last Tuesday this terminal with a million cubic meter of Russian gas is supplied per slipping away hour.
In full capacity, these would be 3 million cubic meters per hour as well as 6 millions per years 2012.

Why does the unemployment rate of more hindered more employed remain on so high level?
Approximate 19% of the hindered people are on search for a job.
Today that begins" 15th week of the work for hindered".
In spite of a purposeful public politics, that was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate is with hindered people always doubly as high as the average average: 19% contrary to 9% Arbeitlosigkeit of the entire population.
Discouraging?
"No, so Éric Blanchet, general director of the union emphasizes aligns Adapt, that the" week of the work for hindered"".
"That within of fifteen years progress obtained are considerable".
"At that time the unemployment rate was not double, but rather triply so highly".
"Nevertheless much to do" remains yet enormously.
It must be said however that for the hindered unemployed further numerous hindrances remain, before they get a job.
More frequently it encounters the older: 37% are older than a 50 years (17% in the average).
They control a slight qualification level: No graduation examination and it have be 80% of them only 10,000 hindered under the 2.3 million students with higher development conclusion.
In conclusion also the long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in the hindered vis-à-vis 38% in the entire cut.
In short there are so many criteria that impede a renewed work entry, and that that "kernel of the problem form", so Christian Grapin, general director of Tremplin, a 1992 established union who is helpful business there to recruit hindered employed.
So much to the objective brakes.
The unspoken, the spirit bearings, that remains develop further itself to be sure certainly, but yet slowly.
A study carried out in April by the union IMS Entreprendre for the periodical La Cité indicated, the questioned managers have would be "a weak knowledge level regarding hindered", that "over-represented" "of people in wheelchairs, psychically or intellectually Minderbemittelten".
Result is that the private businesses with more have than 20 colleagues another far way before itself, around the position goal of 6% hindered employed, which became festival written in a law by 1987, to obtain.
These last-named, from the year 2008 coming numbers refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
"We find us now in about 3%", reports Pierre Blanc, general director of Agefiph, the organization who is delegated therewith to collect contributions of business, that neglect this law.
The proof: The number" fees more paying" business sites has just as as the sum of the deposited sums between 2007 and 2011 diminished itself, and to be sure of 59,000 on 46,000 (and of 606 on 480 million Euro).
"The law of 2005 which contribution increase plans, created a strong pressure on the businesses, explained Pierre Blanc".
"But this improvement expresses also a real insight especially at the firm groups".
According to the ministry for work, only 59% of the business sites between 20 and 49 colleagues hindered employed, business with 100 to 199 colleagues busy on the other hand 82%.

"It is time for me, at which start to go".
Hazard will come after Saint Denis, induced Friday evening against Rumania with respect to the Matchs against France to shine around finally"".
Without omitting however the note of the "pleasure".
It fires led the French national team since the age of 7 years on, its triumphant expeditions it between 1998 and 2000.
"I became always supports", confirmed it.
This contributes inevitably in addition to reinforce that" unique" character of this encounter yet more.
So much in advance:" Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there", imagines it.
"We ran" us just over the way.
To be allowed to play "against it meant good fortune"!
Leekens let be discernable for its part with good-natured-ness" pride".

Portugal very confidently
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento sees with optimism the return match against Bosnia (22:00 clock) this Tuesday in Lisbon toward.
In the away game, the objectivity had been missing both teams.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we become a happy team and above all a happy country be".
Paulo Bento sees itself already in Poland and the Ukraine.
For it, there is not the slightest approach of doubt that itself "La Selecçao", its Nationalelf, for which it responsibly has drawn since September 2010, for which European championship 2012 will qualify.
For Portugal, that in the deed means only 90 minutes bliss.
But there is a Match to play, and an opponent to clear, and to be sure Bosnia.
In consideration of the away game (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it will seem obviously that the cubes fell not yet.
Portugal dominated over more than an hour clearly the party, but the team was not able, to press the thing the so important stamp, that would have taken the pressure of it.
"That is a good result that entails however a certain risk, because we have" no abroad gate obtained.
Home however, in its brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, are convinced the Portuguese to come themselves before an audience, that would be allowed to be just as on the game, through, even if the party was announced naturally as" very tightly", said the optimistic, however klarsichtige Bento.
"We expect a very tight Match, are however perfectly therefrom convinces, the waiter hand win to can", explained the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We have further a 50 %- ige chance in the European championship 2012 at the same time to be", relativized however the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
That undecided on Friday in Bosnia will force the Portuguese in addition to obtain and to win a gate.
An undecided already can suffice the Bosnians who compel have also a gate.
"That is a good result, that however a certain risk rescues, because we no abroad gate obtained have", regrets Bento.
"We become against a team begin, that high technical qualities possesses and over player with many individual qualities orders", joined he thereto.
How already in Zenica the Portuguese before would have to exert already to beginning of maximal pressure on the Bosnians, around" them no time for meditation admit"."
A good idea, under the prerequisite that it is transferred this time into the deed.
