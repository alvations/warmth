The official forecasts have indicated that 3%, reported Bloomberg.
Unlike the central banks American, British and Canadian, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not fallen the rate of Intéret director by saying that the reduction of Intérets, with the growth of prices Matieres Premieres and reducing the rate of unemployment, would lead has the generation of a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep inflation below but close to 2%.
According to one analyst, this is the catch 22 for the ECB: "We must deter', so that we do not have an inflation has speak on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3% is a record over the twelve years Dernieres and Spain, it is up 3.6 has 4.1.
Inflation in the euro zone have taken off as a result of the rapid increase in prices of food and energy.

Gallup indicates a crisis of government
Apres a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (alliance of young Democrats) has significantly increased the beginning of December. Since 2002, and it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup Institute (polling) has never seen before such a low support Socialist, namely 13 per cent.
For the voters Fideles, the difference would be, because of the greater determination of voters in the opposition, support of more than two-thirds (71%) against the support of a Cinquieme (20 per cent) for the Mszp (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (forum Democrats Hungarian) and the Szdsz (alliance of free Democrats) are below the threshold of Members: their support is of 2% in the whole population.
On the voters Fideles certain to vote, the number of supporters of the two parties has increased by 1%.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate in comparison with the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who felt that the economic situation in the country was Particulierement serious has never been so high, it amounts has 41% and 46% supplementary the situation is quite serious.
Apres the most optimistic prospects in the spring and last summer, families are again more pessimistic about their situation Financiere.
For next year, the majority of the population is worsening and only a Dixieme provides for an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71% of those polled, has a majority that has not been seen in the polls earlier Gallup, have ruled that the Prime Minister was his work more harm than good.
13% of those polled have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38% support Viktor Orbán.
54% do not at all trust in the Prime Minister and 27% to the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society belief that discontent vis-a-vis the Prime Minister can be without Treaty change of government.
While Apres riots last October, 35% of those polled wanted the government and the Prime Minister remain in office, the rate currently accounts for only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33%) believe that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
Has the question about intend to vote, 60% of those polled saying that they would certainly vote and 20% supplementary say they would probably vote.
To make a comparison, to a "legislative election organise' next Sunday, only 55% of those polled participate certainly and 15% supplementary participate probably. Following the current intentions, the result of the referendum would no doubt.
74% of people would say no to fees in higher education, 79% say not at the expense of consultation and 84% say not at the expense of residence has the hospital.
Only when we look at the Memes proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89% of voters would reject the introduction of fees, charges of consultation and costs of residence has the hospital.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its price of ESRP of 20%
The big supermarkets implanted in the triangle trading Budaörs kept the average increase in prices of 16% of the year Derniere has the difference that this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Rule of Napi Gazdaság economy (daily)
This year, in the triangle trading Budaörs, a basket of Christmas usual daily has also increased from 16% on average, an increase in value has far greater thousand agricultural-environment be adopted in all the big supermarkets.
The price, "which had already gone' shops in major food last December, no longer have increased brutally compared has the basis previous high.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that the articles bought far below nine thousand agricultural-environment year Derniere Coutent now more than ten thousand agricultural-environment.
The basket daily in the big supermarkets those polled has exceeded 91 agricultural-environment, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand agricultural-environment.
And the value of the highest basket stood has 10 573 agricultural-environment.
(In 2003, it was to 6 800 agricultural-environment.)
The price of Unicum and fish living have remained virtually at the level of the year Derniere, however, the price of net Turkey, nuts and poppy have increased considerably.
In the shops, the price of flour and bread followed the Ksh (central statistics Institute), but in Auchan, have been found bread a kilo has 139 agricultural-environment only.
The competition has not fallen below the price of the product of 200 agricultural-environment.
It was surprising, in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle record of two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 agricultural-environment, it Coutait that 257 agricultural-environment the bottle record is understood.
There Empeche that this year, in terms of basket daily, Auchan was the most expensive and the cheapest Cora.
Of Apres our calculations, Cora has increased the price of its basket daily 15% while Tesco and Auchan have increased respectively of about 18% and 18.
By comparing the basket the more expensive of the year Derniere and the cheapest basket of this year, we see a gap of 12% while the difference between the cheapest of the year Derniere and the more expensive this year is of 21%.
Prices rose by 1 480 agricultural-environment on average.
The year Derniere, prices rose by 1 206 agricultural-environment on average, although we know that the impact of the increase in the rate of VAT was already noted in the prices of Christmas of last year.
This process has made perplexed trade, the big supermarkets could not determine clearly what margin apply on products as they were unable to predict the impact of the change in prices on consumption.
(if a trader calculated evil rotation of a product, it is in danger of losing a huge profit on the margin has adapted the intensity of trade.)
Because of the change in the rate of VAT, the increase in the price of the basket daily has evolved Maniere so excessive that the basket the more expensive was higher 1 720 agricultural-environment has the value of that of 2006 while the difference between baskets the cheaper was only 844 agricultural-environment.
This year, the difference was not as excessive as the value of the basket more expensive was in excess of 1 630 agricultural-environment has one of the year Derniere and cheaper prices rose by 1 284 agricultural-environment also.
By bringing the two seasons Christmas, we have seen an increase catastrophic price, in less than 20 months the price of Articles of daily consumption has increased by more than 30% in the big supermarkets.
(This confirms not necessarily the data Ksh: for some Alimentations of premiere need, the Institute of statistics has seen an increase in prices over 30% in 12 months.
This is the case for example of flour and egg.)
According to the basket daily, this seems almost absurd level since the price of this product, already well dear year Derniere, has risen by just over 10% compared has the basis.
According to the evidence, the providers meal occupy a stronger position that suppliers egg because they have succeeded has to accept the sharp rise in prices also by the multinationals.
In the golden triangle trade, the big supermarkets do not complain, they are constantly good years.
Apres of our experience, the majority of customers do not look at the price in the three supermarkets visited.
They Achetent while quantity, they take food long-life by hues.
On Wednesday morning tails important have formed the coffers of three hypermarkets because the number of customers has increased suddenly.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important province, many multinationals complain Aupres companies poll of 2006 will not achieve the turnover planned, not only for food but also for the consumer durable articles.
Many hospitals are economy on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork medical staff do not help has block infections, says the chief doctor of the national centre for epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also the economy on disinfectants
There is no long an infection MRSA has been diagnosed in the service of Traumatologie hospital János.
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics was detected on a man in hospital following a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection in 2006 place.
The injured from a serious car accident left the hospital but little time he Apres of return because of an infection MRSA and, since then, doctors have not been able to make a significant operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1 094 infections Hospitalieres generated by an agent Pathogene Multirésistant have been declared the Systeme national monitoring nosocomial, has indicated Karolina Böröcz doctor, chief of the national centre for epidemiology.
Has aware that this is the number of infections caused by an agent Pathogene Multirésistant which has really been made in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Around two-thirds of the infections (683 infections) have been caused by the MRSA, in other words by the staphylococcus aureus resistant has the Méthicilline-oxacilline.
A third of people are carriers of the bacterium staphylococcus aureus (its) in their nose without develop a disease.
Infections caused by its (such as Angines, Amygdalites, infections, skin infections traumatic) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily cured.
However, if the antibiotics are used to Maniere excessive or inappropriate, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, develop a good bacteria resistant to antibiotics which Proliférera quickly in poor conditions Hospitalieres.
In the event of poor functioning provisional or extended the immune Ltd, this bacteria can cause infections Hospitalieres serious, such as an infection or a traumatic endotoxic, on the sick older, small weight or with a body weakened.
According to the doctor director of the hospital János, there is nothing particularly in infection MRSA, these infections are parts of the daily hospitals.
We must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, there is no MRSA only or they are not seeking, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The its resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, carers sets of rubber gloves and masks protection and we have antibiotics suited to the cure", said Tibor Nyulasi.
In principle, the patients in hospitals are examined if they are carrying MRSA, but the infection can not always be avoided.
The Prélevement of the sample is not the way
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented but the conditions and the circumstances are not favourable in hospitals, Hungarian, to prevent the development and proliferation of agents Pathogenes resistance, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is manifested above all in hospitals and in homes for the elderly, hospitals should monitor the sick hospital and isolate the sick immediately carry MRSA.
However, the Prélevement microbiological is not the way in hospitals Hungarian.
We must bear in mind that the cash national social security fund these examinations.
Most cases does not see the day that if the infection MRSA is detectable on the patient, said the doctor chief of epidemiological centre.
The European Union has stringent recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are directives Hungarian also for curing infections and syndromes.
We must make efforts to that antibiotic therapy is targeted, in other words microbiological examinations should be made to Empecher resistance to medicines hospitals but not always take account.
Achieving Prélevements microbiological is even more rare in outpatient care and care basis, reported Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals are economy on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA Proliferent a patient has another more often through the medical staff.
It is therefore important to wash their hands, to put gloves and masks protection, but considerable gaps are detected in hospitals in this area.
The MRSA Proliferent by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact, but because of the conditions in the hospitals Hungarians, the patient contaminated can not always be isolated.
Moreover, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too ESRP each other when in terms of the epidemic, patients should be far apart from each other to 1.5 metres to a minimum.
Unfortunately, we also note as hospitals, situation Financiere difficult, cut back on disinfectants, they lack Infirmieres, the sick are many, and the risk of infection is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or the preventive measures are complied with, the number of infections is lower of Maniere demonstrable or the proliferation of the agent Pathogene can be blocked.
Draft government against MRSA
The treatment of the infection MRSA is spending exorbitant funds for social security, that is why we fight everywhere against this infection.
In England, for example, the government has established a programme to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to information published, this programme is effective and infection MRSA show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) revealed among its priorities the prevention of the impact of agents Pathogenes resistance (such as MRSA) and also the prevention of infections Hospitalieres caused by these agents Pathogenes.

The Quatrieme reason for the action is the rejection by the free trade Union of railway workers (Vdszsz), linked to the trade unions of the League, of the proposal of Ministere of the economy and transport on the railway lines secondary and waiting for another proposal.
Political capital: the Hungarian guard has increased the risk countries
According to the division risk analysis of political capital (risk analysing division), the activity of the guard Hungarian up in Aout last, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (movement for a better Hungary) is increasing, in many respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "warning of risk, society points out that, in relation to the activity of the guard Hungarian, the greatest risk policy is already" in the short term ethnic clashes aggressive may occur following the worsening of ethnic tension already existing between the population and gypsy not gypsy Hungary.
The research institute went on to say that the political strategy of the guard Hungarian aimed probably has cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "actors public have passed the public debate on the matter of Roma representatives of political groupings radical and extremes that have a political strategy based on the dispute between gypsies and Hungarians.
The Probleme is aggravated, the normal dialogue becomes impossible, the extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflict is more likely, they say.
Indeed, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of media Hungarian and international activity guard Hungarian "has deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, in particular on the confidence in the stability and the democratic maturity of the country.
They remind us that, following has greater publicity has given the reorganisation of radical groups and extremes right Hungarian since the autumn of 2006, numerous associations were set up in Hungary since the summer of 2007 is giving the name of' national association self-defense ".
"The common characteristic of these gatherings is that they define as a civil organisation when they are saying publicly the preparation of their members has missions of defence (disasters, national defence, defence order), armed if necessary, moreover, by referring to the inability of the police, the army, in other words of the State, they added.
They have pointed out that everything was going on according to the method, based on the society by the political parties and has, seeks disguising different political ambitions under a civilian.
The emphasis on the Caractere civil and status association serves only that has avoided Pieges legal registration of these associations to the Court but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the guard Hungarian is a factor which increases the risk in relation to the neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, many countries neighbouring cite the Hungarian guard as a potential source of risk and politicians ultranationalists of some neighbouring countries wish to justify their policy Anti-Hungarian with reference has the Constitution guard Hungarian.
This influence the political stability of the region, have added.
According to the research institute, the Constitution guard Hungarian is not a single Phénomene in Central Europe, the political risks have increased on the region as a whole.
As they say, the operation of the guard Hungarian looks like, for example, has the activity of the National Guard Bulgarian whose constitution has been declared by the Bulgarian national Union (Bnu) Aout in 2007.
The many problems of Roma that have occurred in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the Constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the Bnu has decided to set up a guard by saying that the objective of the organisation is "national self-defense."
In their view, these Dernieres 17 years, gypsies have' terrorised' Bulgaria but the state remained inactive and neutral, points out the political capital.
They added that the initiative had given rise to intense debate in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration of some organisations of Roma Bulgarian on the Constitution of their own care as a resistance point out the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the guard Hungarian showing similarities with that of the National Guard Bulgarian not ruled out that the Roma Hungarian react has the threat of the 2006 Maniere by organising their own self-defense, can we read in the warning of risk of political capital.
At the request of the Agency information brief, Attila Juhász, director of research of political capital, said that the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events taking place that could have an impact on the change of the risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case, by issuing a warning of risk.
The Fete is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days of Fete and, around Fetes, it has become aware of reorganising the working days which will reduce the number next year.
The Fetes are not uniform in the EU and the us either.
The Hungarian legislation distinguishes the days of Fete national and state and day of rest.
The days of rest are often linked has Fetes religious or has important historic events.
In Hungary, we Fetons the new year, the last day of the year ends and the first day of the new year are also days rest, all the more so that the Réveillonneurs can rest in peace.
Moreover, in a year, we have in any eleven Fetes marked in red.
On 15 March is a Fete national commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as the 23 October which is also the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
The 20 Aout, we Fetons the constitution of our State, 1 May is the Fete labour and on 1 and 2 November, we remember the members of our family and friends who have died.
In addition, we have two days has Easter, the whit and Christmas.
The days of our Fetes State, national or religious rarely falls on a weekend, according to the timetable, it has become aware of reorganising the working days in the case or it is a working day before or Apres the Fete marked in red.
It is true that we are paying the price of weekend sustained by working or going has school on Saturday before the weekend extended.
For many years, the Labour Minister statue in Regulation Particuliere on the days of replacing days before or after the Fetes.
The law extends to all employers and employees for all their employees, on the officials and the people working in the public service.
It does not apply, however, to the service companies, institutions turning point and without a break in service, by their vocation, and also for the days of rest.
This year, the working days will be modified only around Fetes of the end of the year, from 24 December, life is private almost throughout the country because according to the most people experience rather overtime or taking holidays they have saved has these purposes in order to move the days between Christmas and the day of the new year at home.
Next year many Fetes fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The timetable will be reorganised the premiere time around the Fete labour to enable employees to stay at home four days of Affilé.
On Saturday 25 April will be a working day for a day of rest on Friday 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for October 23: on Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing the Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year ahead in the context of Fetes as from 24 December, everyone will pause non-stop 2006 if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.

We proceed slowly in matters usual in the morning.
All of a sudden, a tune Particuliere his voice has the radio: the voice of a violin has effects which electronic associated.
I amounts sound.
Music exchange rate and the low comes to accompany the tone of all at a time, then a choir female has just join as a real smart.
Mr2 diffuse the song wings of love of Zagar.
Life musical Hungarian point we were spoiled for a long time with a pop electronic good quality.
However, now it seems that matters is different if you tapping the new Smiths of Zagar.
The emergence of Yonderboi, the few new productions interesting born of the digital underground Hungarian begin little has recently change the overall picture and, despite the new way of rock of garage harrowing the Guitare, the électropop Hungarian proves that there is the new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer came to Pécs and it was playing own in the Group of Yonderboi before it embarks on its own way, Peut-etre because there is no room for two feet in a 2006 footwear.
Its draft (Zagar) and its music, a compound of jazz, of music Dansante electronics and pop, began has become well known when he was given the composition of Soundtracks filmed (P.ex.
The season Ferenc Török).
The training playing at the beginning in small clubs began has to be known by a more general public when the magazine Wan2 quoted their first Smiths of 2002 fifty among the most important records of the market and Hungarian proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, almost the only creators of the trend Hungarians would also be competitive in the West.
Zagar and whole undoubtedly have become "trendy" but no one has asked whether it is prepared to bring this label.
The group has reacted properly, it has emerged a new and better record.
The Smiths entitled cannot walk fly instead, out recently, can open up new paths for them, although the title wants to be a continuity with the past years has Pécs.
Is that it was a line of the former group of Pécs of Balázs Zságer.
We are well with the reference to the flight but alongside the music air now appears, following the spirit and the trend of the time, the Guitare stronger impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, singer working currently in England with the group the puzzle, showed his talent in these songs at the premiere of the Smiths the millennium park.
On the Smiths, there is a real tract for radio, Mr2 Petõfi, broadcast from little popular music from morning till night, has started introduce the songs of wings of love registered with six Chanteuses Hungarian (' underground' ").
Therefore everything is fine (?).
Hvg.hu has asked questions has Balázs Zságer.
Hvg.hu: this new tract has led me to ask a question: does your music is music remained a leading role in some layer?
Zságer Balázs: the term of music for a certain layer I said no great thing.
For me there are two castes in the music Légere; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop music but commercial and music sincere.
The music itself saying alternative, underground can also be poor and made only to sell them and become and trade.
However, a good pop song can be sincere.
The attitude reception works in this spirit also regardless of the language or Frontieres.
Hvg.hu: do you see a difference between the public Hungarian and foreign, is that one or the other is more open has your music?
Zs.b.: has abroad, especially the West has music Légere most old traditions.
The people go to the concerts and young people not only a dozen or Vingtaines years but also the elderly.
They are following with much more attention the changes in the music Légere because they think that it is also part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: what is the role of the public in tone work?
You like to know who, or how many people and listen to your music?
Zs.b.: I am of course pleased that people are more and more of us has our concerts.
However, we have never done music for the market.
For us music is not made in order to achieve the objective but for a reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or influence mutual works health but it is seen that in the changes elusive at the time.
However, I have noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you will be more interesting.
Hvg.hu: do you follow the example of Auditors Yonderboi?
He works only and Carriere rather has the West.
Zs.b.: we really do not follow its path 2006 if sometimes some are trying to find traces in our music.
We are rather players in team who have confidence in the presence music for others and let us be deployed.
Early on, it was inevitable that our music is compared has that of Yonderboi because many of us has to leave his group and has taken a different path.
Hvg.hu: on the Palmares of Mr2 Petõfi, wings of love holds the premiere place.
Many people have heard the name of Zagar for the premiere time through this song.
With this style more popular you open consciously towards a broader layer?
Zs.b.: we have no plans to make a tract to sell the record.
This song means more.
We wanted it to the final of the Smiths to try to soften the orgy of sounds and themes more difficult addressed throughout the record.
Hvg.hu: how do you chosen the six Chanteuses?
why they, what was the guideline?
Zs.b.: the idea was to have a choir of its kind gospel.
We have had the idea of putting together this choir good youth of the scene musical Hungarian.
And was made up the choir has six Members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [neo], Juci Németh, which has been christened then underground'.
Hvg.hu: you wanted this song like that or girls have changed a little?
Zs.b.: this piece existed for a long time already in a version instrumental and then when we have made up the Smiths, we thought it was still something has this song.
Following agreements drew the voice of the song.
I have sung the night 2006 the tune that girls have learned later.
I had almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that I was galvanized at the time but we needed to edge of'.
With my voice it would not have had the strength 2006.
Hvg.hu: on the disc and the concert also it seemed to me that girls were Arriere plan.
There is no solo (with the exception of a solo run short of Judy Jay), they have no role only, they sing all together and they sing not stronger than the music, so the music is not that accompany their song.
They were Derriere on the scene.
Is it wanted?
Zs.b.: the fact that they were in Arriere plan is the only has Problemes technical.
On the other hand, what was voluntary, is that we did not want to distribute roles of solo.
The song also says that we must rather forget our egos, which has just forget or, or, we should just leave that these wings, the wings of love, we win.
I wanted to feel that the other also this euphoria that we have felt when the song was born.
Hvg.hu: which songs you did the most work?
Zs.b.: in fact, no about the process of creating music, we have had more difficult pieces in the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray' s dilemma, or I play has a piano together, or with Rock' N'roll via to the girls, or the groove did not want to work for a long time, and then, small has small, everything is put in place as in a puzzle.
Hvg.hu: what is your preferred on the new Smiths?
Zs.b.: this is changing all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already' dropped' this record.
At the moment, it is prophet is has fool, escape from the earth and never the same.
The Tradeur perfidious has risked billions because of his inferiority complex
a fraudster Dissimulateur.
And appoints its former used the giant French society general, the owner of the Bank Czech Komerční Banka.
The Bank has lost because of him almost EUR 5 billion.
But it seems rather than Kerviel is just a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and which, furthermore, can not be regarded as incapable.
Contrary to all the major houses of Bank, he acknowledged to time the market crisis of American mortgages.
"It is fragile", have suggested superiors who have denounced to the police.
However, if according to the statement of Kerviel reported by the French media, that the world, the transactions of this man produced at the end of last year a benefit amounting to EUR 1.6 billion.
The crisis over the US
"all I wanted was to make money for my bank", he says in the statement.
Last summer, he has managed to take advantage of the crisis in order to win us half a billion euros.
In fact, it has felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the mortgages so-called sub-prime ", given to low-income customers or those who had met in the past of the difficulties of reimbursement, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole of the economy.
Kerviel scepticism about them and it has been.
And, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I had won my first half, I did not know how to say," entrusts Kerviel and adds that it did, of course, nothing kept to himself. "
Throughout the interrogation, it must confess be distorted reports so as not to be environment.
It has managed to fool his superiors, although the stock market Eurex has begun to take an interest in its transactions.
That risks nothing N Geneva has nothing
Craignait-il to be found?
In fact, it is not.
"I felt that the mere fact of having achieved 1.6 billion for the Bank would meet."
Where its willingness to risk if big?
He failed to arrive at his post gradually.
He had started to work in society in general 2000 just after he finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary revolved around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, it was already assistant Tradeur and, in 2005, it has become Tradeur independent with an annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
However, he knew that it would gain ever as far as the other.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered that the other.
In view of my university curricula and my professional experience and staff, "said the investigators Kerviel.
However, shortly after he took office, he wins his first great success.
Thanks to the actions Allianz, he won half a billion euros building on the reduction of this capacity in the London bombings.
And the mechanism was triggered, he wanted more.
As you Gagnes, it leaves you in peace
"There was a snowball effect", he said the police.
But the superiors were aware of all, or rather, they knew.
"As I Gagnais, they seem to turn a blind eye."
But then comes the scope of the beginning of the year.
It loses EUR 1 billion in a day.
Has Mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when it comes to work, it is no longer employee of the Bank.
A few days later, the Bank announced that it has lost EUR 5 billion due to him.
And how is it that has discovered?
It has become suspect because of its holidays.
"Last year, I was only four days leave.
A trader who does not take holiday is a trader who does not allow his book to another ", concludes Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers have signed nine in any operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, provide 14 billion (around EUR 365 billion kronor Czech) to the Czech Republic.
This is almost half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can obtain Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Almost 125 billion Crowns from seven will be operational programmes for the regions Czechs.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kronor in the framework of the programme enterprise and innovation.
The transport sector will benefit the most, up to 150 billion.
The programme transport is the most important and the operational programme is up to 22% of the financial resources that the Czech Rép. can achieve in the framework of these projects.
The money will be responsible for an increase in the budget from the bottom national transport infrastructure which will manage next year a sum of payments billion kronor.
The programme enterprise and innovation, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new methods of management more effective.
So far, the Czech Rép. was part of the new members, beneficiaries of EU funds the less successful.
The Court has confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday sentenced to 20 years in prison for the former President of the country Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for fraud of $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion kronor).
However, later it was released and lived under house arrest in his Hacienda near the capital city of Nicaragua.
If the former head of the state Centre-américain, according between 1997 and 2002, will again or not Encarcéré is at the moment, according to the Agency PA, not clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will depend now prison officers, or they will leave Aleman end his sentence at home, or will again in prison.
There are four years, the Court has proven that Geneva Alemán was regularly money from the government to Auditors of foreign companies in Panama.
It was fictitious companies and the accounts actually belonged to the members of his family and closest supporters.
Some of this money has gone into the funds that Geneva Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
We adopted the budget
That is the way it is.
The state budget has been adopted.
Why is this budget is exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by the government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
For the current year that happened a year ago thanks to the support of the Socialist Party Czech čssd, because it is the Minister Sobotka who had prepared and čssd could not afford its refusal.
Unlike the turbulent debate before the vote of the declaration of no confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies adopted without any problems this law, although the more influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
We like it or not, each chapter and each rule are the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is part of the constituent political, albeit hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive media and that is why we give him more attention in the media.
The wrangling of politicians much more interested in Geneva l opinion that the figures rash.
The national budgets of socialist governments are suffering from past three evils that the current budget is not able to deal with both.
The first of which is the important given at the expense of mandates imposed by law, constituted by not only pensions, but also by social security, adopted last year by the "coalition" silent composed of the parties čssd and Ksčm.
The second is an economy deficit, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is made up of the deficit of public finances, i.e. by the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, this is not the deficit of the state budget which is the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb, it is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors broadcast often, stunned, obligations, disproportionately into their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, rights and tax credits, bank of new sources of investment.
In previous years, they managed to pay off these debts by selling the actions of mass distribution systems, especially those of energy, obtained from the state in the context of privatisation.
Today, they have more of this Souce.
If we stick to the facts only official and verifiable, we see that:
Our economy is going through already for several years, like the rest of the world, a period of growth and čssd no shortage of Venter.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularise the public finances.
However, instead of this, they Endettaient the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania and Egypt, have managed their affairs far more reasonable than our Republic.
It is a disgrace monstrous which falls mainly on previous governments.
We are part of countries which, on a global scale, are less threatened by poverty.
There is therefore no need to massive social programmes which have, in recent years, unfortunately unnecessarily Enflés.
Although we managed to remove some of the expenditure populist absurd, approved last year before the elections, if a discrepancy of the age limit for retirement, and a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and anyone who will be in power, it will only administer.
In éxagérant barely, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats distributing Méchaniquement the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget can not be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism which means that the ordinary costs are rejected by the costs of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion scheduled for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if previous governments had not taken away all the money they could.
If we really do not want that sometimes the political power become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile coalition government, aware that the state can not spend the equivalent of what happens to take in taxes and rights tax, the calm necessary for the preparation of new laws to reform.
There is that they will gradually a state budget balanced.

The banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve of American reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks English, Swiss and Canadian have decided to work together to combat the crisis of the financial markets.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be placed on the money markets by the Intermédiare of auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, by a system of auctions, interest rates Auquels they are prepared to borrow money.
For example, the EDF American will send at auction $40 billion and, furthermore, it will provide 24 billion to European central banks and Switzerland.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual States have determined action so concerted, to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This tends to resolve the major problems of the economy growing, namely the lack of free capital that banks could pay', writes in his report to clients Bernard Baumohl society Council economic outlook group.
"The concerted action by central banks has diminished the likelihood of a recession in the United States of 65% to about 50%," adds Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already lost 60 billion dollars because loans not repaid, especially in the US.
Analysts expect further losses in billion.
"If central banks have chosen this approach is that they should really grasp what can be successful," said the chief economist of the AMRO agitated Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad", adds.
Central banks fear that, if the banks themselves will have a difficult access to loans, they will pay more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into recession can influence the economic growth of the world.
The central banks have made this choice after it has failed to bring down the interbank rate of London, called Libor, used to borrow on the interbank market.
Which meant that banks feared always borrowing mutual, despite the fact that the central banks American, Canadian and English have fallen on several occasions, in the autumn, their interest rates.
"This will have the same effect that a further cut in interest rates," said the Reuters news agency Greg Salvaggio society Tempus consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of the central banks nothing to avert the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem which is the fall of the property market in the United States.
President Klaus: the debates ecologists are incredible
Global climate change are supposed to be harmful above all to the developing countries.
President Vaclav Klaus has once again expressed its view on the problem of global warming.
The critical struck this time on the UN International Conference on climate change in Bali.
Has Vienna, where he presented his book The blue planet, not Green, it has stated that the debates ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric and the accompanying reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is only a rocket words, ersatz solutions to the current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President has pointed out, when presenting his book, that it has great importance for him and that is why it is committed to this cause.
It has also expressed its satisfaction that his book also appears in German translation, because, he said, "I often meeting that the caricature of my views".
Now, those interested can read its positions without being distorted.
Klaus pointed out that although it is not weatherman, it has nevertheless, in his opinion, enough provisions to draw up such a white.
This is an academic able to follow and assess Treaties scientists, it has the practice of the statistical and it is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the books, is, according to him, the arguments: climate change is constantly evolving, it is normal there is no view of all researchers on climate change, the effects of the current changes are neither too high nor too serious, they do not represent any danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence climate change are unnecessary, inefficient and unacceptably expensive.
As with the experience of a totalitarian regime, it considers unacceptable to impose views Invérifiées the other, what it feels like an attack dangerous to freedom.
In response to the questions of those present, he explained on several occasions that it was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between the costs and profit they make".
Has Vienna, Klaus had already discussed this matter two months ago, to the Institute Hayek.
600 thousand people have failed to renew their driving licences on time
Six hundred thousand drivers have left to run on and have failed to renew their old driving licences whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day where people can still ask the renewal, so that the authorities are in their way to issue a new licence before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without permits valid travel along the road.
According to the authorities, have not renewed their driving licence especially those who want more lead.
While the common indicate a fall in the number of applications for renewal of licence, the authorities in the capital are invaded of requests and the number of requests for renewal of the licence is gone increasing this week.

Polívka has lost Valaiské Království (the Kingdom of Valaisko)
Bolek Polívka has lost the dispute about the marks Valaiské Království (Kingdom of Valaisko).
According to the judge of the regional court in Ostrava, it is he who had used for the first time the title of King Valaisko, but the project has been set up by the team around Tomái Harabii, a former employee of the player.
Polívka was not present at the hearing today.
Indeed, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr Harabii and his team Parasitent on the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the trial of the lawyer Polívka.
In his view, the words Kingdom of Valaisko talk to everyone precisely this player and comical.
Harabii is of the same opinion.
"There is behind us work almost ten years.
Money for research and development of events, "he said.
According to him, it is the money which is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they found out that the project was successful and that they could benefit from them.
It is they who want parasitic on our work ", he added.
A lucrative business
According to the Court, it is Polívka who used for the first time the title Valaiský Král (King of Valaisko) in his television programme.
The player Radoslav Brzobohatý was crowned King in 1993.
However, at the time, there was no connection with the project to establish a Kingdom shadow.
A few years later, Harabii with the idea has come to seem passports of Valaiské Království.
Action humorous originally a business and a lucrative business, followed by the creation, by Harabii, society Valaiské Království.
In 1997 Polívka has accepted that its name and its signature are mentioned in the passport and it has even proposed to holders of balances on the price of the visit of its firm and its spectacles theatre.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabii has only use the idea nude, published by Polívka in the emission Manéž, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of dumping Polívka Certainemement has helped the draft Valaiské Království," said the judge.
It added, however, that the soul of the project was constituted by Harabii and his team who had dedicated himself to the project intensively.
The cooperation between the parties today enemies continue until 2000 when Harabii organised for Polívka a culmination official Vsetín.
But on that basis, conflict began to accumulate between Polívka has Harabii, which culminated with the evidence "of King dumping 1 elected forever".
The leading role in the Kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabii, assumed by the singer Jarmila šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka has lodged a complaint against Harabii and its society, ask that the Court has today rejected.
What could clarify the matter, it is the tournament envisaged for the throne and a half of the Princess.
It should produce a new king.
Yet he does not want to betray the details and the date.
"We do not want to go fast.
It would be taken as the parade of kings to Slovácko.
The King would be elected for some time.
Even Mr Polívka can of course be ", added Harabii.
Test of the Peugeot 207 Sw 1.6 Vti: Diparition prejudices
In fact, I have never been a great fan of the Peugeot 206.
His qualities of rolling were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, the conduct and also that of the manufacture could, in many ways, be called below the average.
However, there is currently on the market his successor the Peugeot 207, which is much better.
All the more that the combi appointed Sw goes even a step further, it only remains for me to reflect.
When I Testais the Hatchback classic of the Peugeot 207 I Plaignais for example of space for the head on the seats behind.
While there over the complaints because the car combi means that even the major wretches will, in this respect, at home.
Will see quick
I shall refer very quickly within too not to repeat myself.
This is a design more or less succeeded, my only comment on the Tunel central which I think is poor.
Here, I would have liked a design a little more inventive, given that the car has air if elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when we could complain about seats or dossiers too short is over.
Guidance side-impact has also considerably improved compared to the 206 model.
With regard to the area, increasing the size of the car is sensitive there as well.
The combi see disappear also the lack of space already mentioned above our heads.
A boot in the boot
The bigger vehicle, that is its Soutte to luggage.
I have to evaluate it as well accessible (also thanks to the ice Pivotante back) and stowage rather easy.
The blind spaces are in possession of elastic staging a compromise ideal.
It is not awkward and can be extended while being able to take objects Asez heavy.
But we stop the volume.
This fact, according to the tables, 428 l in shaping basis, which is compared to a figure competition instead way.
Apart from the Fabia Skoda combi, the vehicle more sold in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 Sw with the new generation of the product of Mlada dumping, we see that the Peugeot remains very much behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to go on holidays abroad or to instruct a she, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to bring out the benefits, I would mention the below cash remaining after the overthrow of files seats back perfectly right, or a Marche-pied very low.
120 horses distributed on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with an engine Otto four cylinders with a volume of 1.6 L and a power of 88 KW.
And indeed, that is what should look like a 1.6 which walk a Hatchback family.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it leads.
If I compare it with the equivalent of Skoda which often gives the impression of having a pot exhaust closed by a Serpillère, then I can not be that enthusiastic.
If we examine the tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that it has tested a car quite well equipped, with a single spacious and a very good engine.
The price of a vehicle with an engine Otto 1.4 litres amounting to 329 900 Kč is still reasonably good.
The vehicle that we have tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is bad enough.
The equipment premium, also tested, increasing the price of 80 000 Kč.
However, we have prepared as well as airbags, head of an automatic air conditioning, automatic Essuis-glace, a command automatic rear windows ...
In fact, the vehicle costs ultimately 531 900 Kč.
This is a lot, but try to add Fabia at the cost of additional equipment, and you will get a figure very similar.
It is therefore to choose the mark.
The integration of pupils in schools Slovak Britaniques is performing badly
The number of children from the countries of Eastern Europe in schools Britaniques growing, causing among Demeurants concerns about the development of local education.
The integration of East Europeans now faces a series of obstacles.
Schools Britaniques see even cases in which conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original owners are translated into violence.
The case of Kent north, where are beginning to grow conflicts opponents Demeurants and immigrants of origin Slovak illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The disputes, the victims and the fights between pupils have transposed in the relations between the parents.
The situation has gone so far that the police arrested to Chatham a woman Slovak affecting with a bar of iron a pupil Agé of ten years.
The guilty protect itself by saying that the boy had insulted by saying Rasistes.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on an immigrant Slovak led by two teenagers.
The girls were allegedly sent to this man of racist remarks and had laid stones.
"When we returning home, a young rose on the judgment of bus and has started to spit on it.
When I told him to stop, he responded by apples and pears and then it found its unceremoniously ", described another adventure unpleasant a mother of pupils Slovaks.
Complaints are made by both sides.
One of Demeurants has gone as far as to call the conflict with the immigrants to fight for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in schools Britaniques between the inhabitants of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks come to find work are registered in Britain.

Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
for visitors, this is really an island of freedom.
All you expect of your leave can be achieved if you are a good choice.
Beaches gold and white as snow, high waves or a sea calm as a pond.
Of Palmes and all inclusive servers with you on the beach offering a pizza, ice or cocktails heady.
The Kitesurfing, the golf and roulette.
The islands of the Sea of Caraîbes, you are not going to return to this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find even more and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of big Antilles.
At the time of Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus has qualified as the best place that the human eye has never seen.
Havana has become the tabling and the place transhipment treasures that the Spanish had stolen and that they were carrying in Europe.
Then came the American era.
The hotel Nacional has been erected at the beginning of the 1920s'.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the heads of the Mafia American, which did build, because everything a crime in the United States (especially in the prohibition) was recognised and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Parmis its customers, there were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava, Frank Sinatra.
Has Havana, buildings at heights led and cars, belonging to the symbols cults 50 years' of the last century, were circulating on the broad avenues.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco of Paula, near Havana, and, to Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of Showbusiness and politicians America full leaving their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And today?
You can leave yourself your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you Mixera the cocktail of your choice.
And these cars cults still run in Havana, since the Jigoulis and the us once imported have already for a long time, in a climate if Salé and wet, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest, is considerably decrepit, Nullepart elsewhere in the vicinity there are so many monuments colonial splendid that there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism provides the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
In the last 15 years, new hotels led not only in Havana, but above all to Varader, on the coast of the province Holguín, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba proposes a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by fans small trains.
The cane was returned since the plantations extended in the sugar factories on a path close by small trains and steam engine.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and that is how we can see on the march of small locomotives whose contemporary are also only in museums.
Where direct its not?
The majority of visitors no lack the best-known places.
There is therefore no need to write a lot about Varadero or on Havana.
If not point out that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and as the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley Viňales in the west of the island is one of the most corners fanciful to Cuba.
A vegetation Exhubérante forced on a chalk soil.
Of Mogotes, balloons limestone and rocks amount in candle from the bottom of the valley, and the fertile land has taken in their emergency, even his rock rotten are covered a carpet plant very dense.
The valley is where is grown probably tobacco Cuban of the highest quality.
You will be able to meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of the factories cigars in Havana.
Someone will perhaps also interesting that was turned the Chilean episode of major.
Trinidad
Old City founded not long after the Spanish have colonised the island.
This is the market the slave trade and that of sugar which have brought glory and wealth.
The wealth embodied in the beauty and Ville-vitrine of this city of small size.
Koloniální Ipanělská Architektura, Výrazně Ovlivněná Pozdějiími Francouzskými Osadníky, Za čtyři Staletí Téměř Nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the massive mountainous Escambray, is a place to point out that even in the 1950s' of the last century, there was no road link this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation enabled it to stay out.
We are building nothing, and that is why we Démolissait nothing, everyone is simply to have a roof over their heads.
If it has, to Trinidad, more time that afternoon, when it is worth to go and see also places Interessants in the vicinity, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa of the Música which drives after the bed of sun and where the music is Assourdit that the small morning.
Baracoa
Some appoint this village situated to the extreme is of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This view is certainly influenced by the road that leads to it.
The two roads leading up for Guantánamo must cross high mountains and Accidentées and are going through a landscape almost without trade marks of human activity.
UNESCO has included is the pitfall of Cuba, through its landscape intact, on the world heritage list.
It produces the best chocolate, to the Church, there is the Cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it has been almost a hundred years after the journey Columbus) and for the hill, where they are holding the former Chateau-fort and the current hotel El Castillo, we see several mountains table, the most famous is El Yunque.
On the coffee, rum, cigars, the massive mountainous Sierra Maestra, Bay sows and the island of Isla Pinos, the cabaret Tropicana, the Sanctuary of the Holy Patrone of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions practised by the descendants of former slaves, about all this could fulfil a quantity of pages.
Only, as they say, it is better to see once.

The other is to allow people to get themselves a new development of the economy and security, "said the chain BBC Defence Minister Britanique of Browne.

Indeed, according to the US, the allies have achieved their absolute limit and the organization and in equipping troops.
Specifically, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the Entrainement troops in Afghanistan.

We have almost 90% of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and this is not enough, "said of Hoop to the Reuters news agency at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
That is passive
In recent months there also between the countries involved conflict on the issue if all the allies are indeed everything in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans have representation in Afghanistan relatively large.
But they are committed in areas where violence is minimal, the requirements of struggle which they are subjects are not as strict as those in the south and east of the country where we operate, "said gates.
The tabloid Britanique sun has described this week the German soldiers of lazy.
"The Afghans who discovered: the Germans play, while our own fighting," wrote sun in a document supplemented by photographs of German soldiers playing the Tenis table.

It likened today before a court in Khartoum for having appointed a bear in toy
The teacher British judged in Sudan to insult to Islam was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days imprisonment and deportation, said his lawyer.
The British was accused of having left pupils of 6 to 7 years give the name of Mohammed to a bears in toy while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was punishable by a sentence of lashes.
This lady teacher British 54 years in office in the unity high school in Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested Sunday at home and convicted of attack on Islam and of sedition, under Article 125 of the penal code Sudanese, following several complaints from parents Auprés of the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
History actually goes back in September, when the teacher calls on its pupils, between 6 and 7 years, to choose a name for the bears in toy class.
"Eight names out of the mouths of children, whose Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", tells the director of the school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children on 23 have chooses Mohamed as preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Prophet Muslim, but above all a name very common in Sudan.
The children were then made a white class with the photograph of the bears followed the legend "my name is Mohamed."
The bears own was no label with the name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the Prophet seen as an insult to Islam.
One of the colleagues Muslims Gillian monkey, a teacher in the same school in Sudan, has said that he knew well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I regret that it has just asked the children to vote for a name, it is in his view that a" mistake innocent'.
View shared by many pupils teacher who describe as' very friendly to its pupils and which never mentions religion in class.
Let us remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second name as given in Britain, it is written in English 14 different ways.
This first name often chooses by the families Muslim is a way to honour the Prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this first name?
Can we, for example, give a toy?
It is of course a matter of interpretation.

The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13%) and more achieved and the 4.488,88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
His rival Antena 3, which gave yesterday 1,52% and that accumulates lower 40.5% since January, costing half, 2.193,46 million.
The value of other companies Comunication listed amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million in Prisa (the editor of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with antenna 3 is of the fact that' we are talking about two similar companies.
The fact is on what we can do, on the same market, at what price and how we Rentabilisons in terms of hearing'.
Telecinco announced last week that he plans to become this year the first television station to overtake the 1, 000 million income advertising raw, as has assured Giuseppe Tringali, the adviser delegate Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
For that announced this information is real, the television channel should register for the current year an increase of 3.6% in its billing for advertising by the 965,4 million for the financial year 2006.
For its part, the billing net antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the financial year (to the 734,4 million) While the net incomes of television rose by 0.7% (630,4 million).
One of the factors that Annalistes coming to the best on development of Telecinco stock market is the important pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría has distributed 100% of benefit between its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to take a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the compromise to give official for minimal 50%, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make happy our shareholders, to those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market gives at the moment signs of fatigue.
Lehman brothers recently reduced its estimate of profits on Telecinco to 4% in 2008 and 2009, to 7%.
This is because, they argue, down to the predicted growth of the income of 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same company has fallen forecasting gains antenna 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

And the organisation Secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself have announced during a press conference after the meeting held this afternoon the headquarters of the Federal party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former Minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, he stressed that "yes" It seems that the politician channel will be the candidate of the Socialist Group who will chair the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, which he made public on 15 November its decision not to stand for Prochainess general elections and to give up his political career to devote itself to the fight against climate change in the context university.
The former Minister has acknowledged that the President of the government has not stopped insisting that he will return to the forefront policy since he has abandoned two years ago.

A propaganda climate
Since the movement against climate change submitting to a persecution without mercy both skeptics of its predictions that those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate a coherence of iron.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement that is as President of the government Zapatero and who believes that this fight is greater than that of Islamic terrorism and to sign a new contract for the planet.
This approach requires to explain why the action, or inaction, of his government have contributed decisively that Spain is at the head of the European Union in the Non-éxecution Kyoto protocols.
Who is responsible for the Non-éxecution, in which sectors has occurred, and why his government, that of the contract with the world, has not avoided.
Moreover, it should be clear to the Spanish what measures it will take to slow down climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what savings energy individual and collective we will be forced to do, what economic consequences that trigger.
That is to say, who will surrender and who is to pay for save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanations.
Precisely because this is to sacrifice and pay.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until hundredth of petrol suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party has seemed Electoralmente so dangerous to Zapatero has rushed to deny it.
That is to say that this is to save the world with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans devoid of any real consequence.
With phrases that have impact, committees, committees, protocols, of new posts.
With these contracts with the world, Mr so useful for election campaigns which do not, which is not denouncing and which does not require, painted the meetings and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited only to be a contracting party purely virtual and who does not claim that we refers in bicycle or we Rafraîchissions with the range.

What assurance I agree?
motor insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible claims, involves expenditure important will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, age of the driving licence, marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of the Internet, among other things.
Having a car that is the main.
There ES that, Escoger El Seguro of Automóvil Adecuado ES Incluso' Difícil that Elegir El Gruma of Vehículo.
And that is that, choose motor insurance proper, is even more difficult than choose the model of the vehicle.
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise materializes by a contract of insurance, which states that the company receives the value of the premium paid and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which establishes taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, age of the driving licence, marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the Usageque we in fact, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that more likely to have an accident is high, the more popular to pay is high.
That is why the people over 25 years and women have to pay premiums lower, since the statistics show that these Persones have a rate lower claims of their care.
In the same way, using of censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents that drivers single.
The use of the vehicle that affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency the likely increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account in setting the price of the premium.
That is why, that the driver must study the situation in choosing the motor insurance which is best suited to its profile.
We would have to express here the variables at the time of the most significant choose one or other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insurer, it offers a reasonable price.
The young people under 25 years have to deal with various disadvantages when a contract with insurance accessible at a price, as can be the weak experience in the conduct and the age of the driving licence.
Although the ideal to be assured insurance is at risk, other options more economic exist.
The drivers more far-sighted can opt for any risk insurance frankly, so that they get the insurance coverage to any risk but at a price more accessible.
This form of convention means that the customer pays a part of the amount of the sinister.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be established on the basis of the value of the premium, which will be higher over the amount will be weak", specifies Luis Noguera, the head in Spain of first Europa, Ombudsman insurance online.
Another option is the assurance to third enlarged, so that the customer can assure the protection in order to deal with the damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on its own car.
Moreover, it would be covered against theft, fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A Council.
If you are minor 25 years Essaies be careful and to avoid accidents as far as possible, because it has implications for the subsidy, can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A subsidy is a reduction in the basic tariff that has the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"Subsidies and sanctions will depend on the company and profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase subsidies', clarifies Noguera.
Beyond 25 years it becomes easier for drivers at the time of a contract with insurance, since the rate of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained.
It is for this reason that it is better to choose any risk insurance frankly.
"Normally young people can not benefit from the experience gained in advance after an accident", provides the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of conduct, once past the' fear of amateur'.
However, if the customer is married but has not yet children that it is better to negotiate insurance to any risk, the Momento that the economic situation allows us to do so.
Marriages with children are viewed by insurers as people with the rate of accidents the lowest, because the increases will be weaker.
In this case the best insurance would be insurance at any risk frankly (that can be 300 Euros), or insurance to third enlarged from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured person has a high level of subsidy.
"They conduct a more relaxed and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury to take on a greater proportion of exemptions", judge Luis Noguera.
For pensioners insurance to any risk frankly is better (being it of EUR 150), or a Asurance to third enlarged when the insurer has a high level of subsidy.
It must be said that motor insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver against any claims, but also because it represents an important expenditure, and that is why it is vital to study properly insurance which suits us the most in our personal situation.
The Celtic seek to win a point in Milan to reach the elimination of final
The AC Milan and Glasgow Celtic are measured next Tuesday to San Siro in search of the point they lack in order to achieve their respective objectives in the closure of the Champions League, since it serves to the Italians to be first and the Scots to classify.
The Italians - ten points and they have already qualified for the fifth day with no match in Portugal, while the Glasgow Celtic has nine points, but it still needs another point in order to ensure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who gets Benfica who has four, he goes to.
These two matches of group D will be played a week before the sixth day ends, since the AC Milan must argue the Semifinales of the World Cup clubs in Japan on 13 of this month to find a place for the final of 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the match at no stage Giuseppe Meazza appears to be the result as expected, although the two teams will try to break successful, since the Italians do not want to speculate at home and the Glasgow Celtic knows that by gaining it would remain first and ensure a better crossroads in the elimination of final.
A defeat of the team of Gordon Strachan could be sufficient to classify if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not earn, but it can not only on computer since it with nine points the games lies with the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who have won (2-0) in the other duel direct.
Thus, the Milan try to poison the evening the Scots, who have high hopes to classify for the elimination of final for the second time in the Champions League, having been defeated in the latest edition by an end of Kaka during the extra time (1-0).
In the meantime the victory of' Rossoneri' triumph would only Shakhtar, if the Celtic lose, to classify for the elimination of final so that we can continue the UEFA Champions League.
And that is that the Benfica, although it is final and without opportunities to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.

The new case of gas between Russia and Ukraine lays the alarm.
A dispute on the price of gas ferments between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risks of an impact on exports of fuel oil to Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.e) are hauled by pipelines, and each led is strictly monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel oil, it will increase taxes transit to Russia.
Last year, a row between the two, had caused a reduction of supplies to the countries of the U.e.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian Government and Gazprom, society monopoly property of Russia providing gas, have tried in vain to reach agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom has said that he would increase as planned, its prices to Ukraine because it has agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for gas supplies from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts have said that this would for Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the costs of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, pointing out that we are a country through which passes the most gas," announced the Ukrainian Minister of the economy, Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters news agency.
"The fluctuations cost of gas would probably linked to our discussions about taxes transit (to Western Europe) via Ukraine'
The last major row between Moscow and Kiev has caused in January 2006, the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine.
This led to the fall of exports to Western Europe, therefore increasing prices.
The Russian gas accounts for a quarter of supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest stocks of gas, even though most of them are still under developed.
Therefore, Gazprom complete its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health' must control its employees foreigners'.
The Ministry of Health Scottish must improve the controls to be carried out on its employees Non-Community to check if they have previous criminal, said the Committee of control.
The warning of the auditor general, Robert Black, took place after a doctor foreign working in Scotland, was involved in the attack at the airport in Glasgow in June.
Mr Black has also expressed its concern that the Ministry of Health Scottish has no exact information on the number of people overseas that it employs.
His report has highlighted other controls decisive, properly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The auditor general has made controls on the staff Non-Community following the attack on the airport Glasgow.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years, doctor of origin Iraqi in the service of the hospital Royal Alexandra of Paisley, was arrested at the airport after dark with its jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
It was the party of three doctors who have been filmed in the old Bailey in October, because suspected of being involved in various attempts explosion of cars in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will carry out controls meadow employment on the staff overseas, to ensure the validity of their qualifications, experience, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Ministry of Health Scottish use the disclosure Ecossaise to carry out checks of previous criminal, the Agency has no right to receive such information outside of Britain.
Among the many warnings, the report of the auditor general says now that the committees are obliged to confront with the Bureau of control of previous criminal, thus enabling the employers to carry out checks on various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some information about the staff have been verified, this is done every time.' announcement the report.
Mr Black said that the Ministry of Health Scottish carried out most controls meadow employment that he would do itself, but it has also added: "our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that appropriate information on some members of staff overseas are available to health services.
Mr Peter Terry, chairman of Bma Scotland has said that it is "extremely unlikely" that controls meadow employment can identify employees likely to commit future acts of terrorism.
He says "the report suggests that controls meadow employment carried out currently, work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can make any added value."
The Scottish health authorities have said use 1161 people overseas, made up mostly of doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general pointed out that these figures should certainly be adjusted upwards, partly because of problems relating to the identification of members of staff with contracts of indefinite duration, which could choose or not, to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures of controls on health authorities to Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.

The climate of Venus could prove to be the future of the earth.
Scientists have said yesterday that Venus has certainly been a world pleasant to live.
The data from the European vessel in orbit have shown that the world is certainly two times smaller than the earth, contrary to what was thought before.
Venus is the planet closer to the earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of the earth, and may even have been habitable.
But the effect global warming because carbon dioxide, the erosion air Dûe the solar radiation allied to a rotation slower Venus has led to a different kind of development.
Today the world is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and storms of flash and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.
The discoveries from express the probe of the European Space Agency, who has studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the future potential of the land due to the changes catastrophic climate.
Professor of the department of physical Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the mission from the express, said: "We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of the earth, although the planets in even they are almost similar.
"Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that there are billions of years, Venus originally would have been similar to the earth, can be even with a surface habitable."
Enriched uranium kidnapped by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, has been kidnapped by the police Czechoslovak and Hungarian yesterday.

Open to all
Mitt Romney said not match as candidate for the Presidency, in response to the questions of a slip of snow.
Despite this, the candidate for the Presidency Republicans have finally agreed to take part in the debate you tract, during which many ordinary voters have registered their issues, volunteer for the candidate.
On Wednesday evening 28 November, none of the questions has been so ridiculous that one after another debate you tract, when a slip of snow has asked the Democrats their position in relation to global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have much reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, a candidate for the next elections.
It is unclear on what criteria, the producers of CNN, which has Russia the debate, chose the videoclips of you tract to show the candidates candidate.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest addressing a single issue, was focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the strong issues for the Republicans.
CNN has asked some voters to telephone when they would understand things pleasant: the governed noted increases approval when the candidates expressed so gross.
The exchange the hardest and the longest of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the National Front, and Mr Romney which is at the top of the list of important early elections of the Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani has tried to highlight the fact that he was lazy about illegal immigration during his tenure as Mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, use of illegal immigrants at home.
The two fighters have become particularly fierce when they were asked if they would be prepared to promote a "Amnésia' (offering illegal status and the possibility of regular become citizen).
Candidates minors as Duncan hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman of Colorado, managed to deepen.
None of them have the possibility of being elected, but both remain in the race, can be because they have begun to combat immigration before and more incisive than others.
In general, the candidates, at least on immigration, have the same views: borders more rigid, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This, combined with the concerns raised in particular by the issue of toxic toys manufactured in China, and many other fears about the external world, encourage the Republicans to forget, or to play down the divisions between the libertarian and conservative Catholics.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other issues have been raised.
Mr Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for the control of arms.
John McCain and Mr Romney have debated whether to water down the nose should be regarded as torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidate believed in its entirety, the content of the Bible.
This led Mr Giuliani to have the courage to say that the Bible is his book preferred, even if it is not about to believe in the history of Jonas and whales.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, in pole position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his conservatism Christian long-standing - say that the death penalty is painful although necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, it started to laugh and said that Jesus is too smart to stand for election.
The human race Insolitement remains open to all.
The rise of Mr Huckabee in Iowa coincides with the recent enormous subsidies research carried out by the libertarian Ron Paul, and the Sifflements during the debate on Wednesday.
These two here are émergés of nothing, because the two protected of the party can not agree to decide who is the candidate most famous and more traditionalist.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate after the party early and convincingly through a message of success on the greatness close American leaders.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pain of labour
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole in which sink; even if it resign, the situation will not change.
Given the trend of scandals British, it is not particularly lucrative.
No decorations sold or hotel bills Paris of politicians, no finger of up bonus marital Sucé.
But now a revelation shows that a rich man of case would have obscured for four years, under false names, its contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than GBP 650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not declared: a new battle which Gordon Brown would be well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister has backed down in its draft election, insulting stupidly British intelligence declaring that opinion polls have not influenced its decision, and that he hoped on the contrary, offer a government compact and effective.
On the contrary, such Vince cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, said that the terrifying Mr Brown turned to Stalin to Mr bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on the brink of the crash, has demonstrated a flaw directives and a poor judgment in the event of an emergency.
The inadequate proposals for change in the tax code have caused a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million of personal data by the authorities of taxes, revealed an incredible administrative cock-up.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting the cuts in military expenditure: they have declared that be Defence Minister is for them, a part-time work.
At present, the suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of labour (and its former head of the vigilance) that they have had to resign.
None of this means that Mr Brown is heading inevitably towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not like politicians, and do not trust them, but leave their doubts in general to hand in a new government comes to power.
It seems clear that a Prime Minister can not improve things, or even govern for a long time, it risk the suspension: public administration is broken; the cabinets Ministers are the balance sheet; the press research bad stories; and the government is on the defensive and without any objective.
In a sense, the position of Mr Brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, it can not claim to be a beginning.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, it was his lieutenant higher.
The problems of Northern Rock and data taxes, for example, are linked to the decisions of Mr Brown taken when he was Chancellor of the British treasury.
And even if it is not directly involved in the misfortunes of Blair, as the long investigation into the funds of the party "of the face value for the Members of the House of Lords', voters might think the opposite.
But the difficult situation that faces the prospect of Mr Brown is not so tragic that it sounds.
The blunders are not so monstrous as Members of the Party of the Tories believe.
As in Mr bean, there is no victim or fraud.
And the remedy, although painful, could be achieved trends Stalinist Mr Brown, always in favour of a government reliable and slightly brutal.
The new scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr Abrahams, a figure very particular, which compares its donations to charity, said that it wanted no public recognition of his charity.
It can have a different opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
Laws against the anonymity of big Subventionneurs politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: the public has a right to know that contributes to the success of those who govern the country.
Mr Watt, who said to be aware of the programmes of Mr Abrahams, without knowing that this was illegal, must therefore be questioned, as Mendlesohn, responsible for the collection of subsidies which had spoken of dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr Brown is not involved: there is no evidence to suggest that it has been aware of this, even though most payments have been made following its arrival in government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has half.
He quickly condemned the necessary legislative his party, but he has not drawn attention to the fact that the power of decision is based on a device that we know well, to use a committee of inquiry into this matter, consisting of a retired Bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been flouted, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent President for the independent committee on standards of public life, without leader for the past six months, and prepare a good reform on the funding of political parties.
That would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to work with the Tories, which could lead it to give up its financial report particularly with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter that Mr Brown.
But it should cope with supporters.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to regain the voters, and the only way to get a victory is to demonstrate unimpeachable integrity and solid skills.
Fraud of cards.
The crisis of mortgages Contaminerait-elle the American market credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see fins artificially, Tourbillonner around.
Now that the US home market is going through a critical phase, the predators are aimed at the American market credit cards.
Analysts from home Goldman Sachs believe that the losses relating to credit cards could reach $99 billion if the infection mortgages extends to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in rates of costs and insolvency, which measure the share of assessment not recoverable or which are more than 30 days after.
HSBC announced last month that he took $1.4 billion in its funds to consumers, in part because of the weakness of the bearers.
It is too early to panic.
The costs and the insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, an agency tax, the rate of insolvency of 3,89% of Troixième quarter is lower than almost a point in relation to its historical average.
The deterioration rates is understandable in part by technical factors.
A change laws in 2005 in the US, on the personal bankruptcy has caused a fall abrupt archives of bankruptcy, which in turn has caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore rates of insolvency) could increase even if the conditions of loans to get worse.
The industry heralds rate fixed payment, which highlight the amount of debt monthly that consumers must resolve.
Sureté and trust in the capital of credit cards is strong enough despite the paralysis other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of Towergroup, a society of research, has predicted that the volume of emission for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The infection direct links between the crisis of mortgages and the market for credit cards certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their indebtedness now that the mortgage fair have disappeared.
But the card industry are more attention to the flow of species rather than the value of heritage, and therefore the fall in home prices has not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They may even bring benefits issuers of securities credit.
Premiums consumers for the payment of mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, debt by credit card would become a priority for repay.
The card industry are able to respond much more rapidly than mortgage and more flexibility in such conditions of crisis, because they can change interest rates or alter the limits of Rédit.
This should in theory reduce the risk of an early resumption of actions.
"We are not going we wake up one morning and reassess all loans." Said Gary Perlin, the director of capital one.
If a disaster financial market credit cards is unlikely, there is a strong risk for a reduction.
If the lower prices of real estate and a contraction in the credit market lead America to the recession, the industry will certainly face a future macabre.
Please listen carefully to the fins Internet.
The British bankers argue responsible for the Enron case.
The three British bankers should go to express their roles in relation to fraud committed by the previous financial director of Enron, Mr Andrew Fastow, have changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared innocent of the seven charges for alleged fraud collusively in 2000, committed by Fastow in a financial fraud secret in order to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They should present themselves to the Court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by American judge Ewing Jr Werlein, they have all found guilty of committing fraud.
The three ex frameworks Greenwich Natwest, a subsidiary of the group plc of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous throughout Britain because of extradition procedures that have lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is still an open question for this inquiry launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The accusations that were imposed in 2002, have made it clear to Fastow that it was the subject of the investigation of the government in the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, called the "Three of Natwest' claim to be come to Houston in 2000, to organise a scenario fraudulent with Fastow and his former right hand, Michael Kopper.
Natwest Greenwich has invested in a subsidiary of a partner Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the orchestrator of many scenarios fraudulent, which has helped àtruquer procedures of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank estimated its interest in the subsidiary as no, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A society controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the Bank of the subsidiary to GBP 1 million.
The bankers paid $250 to Kopper as interest in this society.
According to the accused, Fastow would falsely announced to Enron that the energy society was have to pay $20 million to Greenwich Natwest for its actions in the subsidiary.
But the truth is that these $20 million went into the pockets of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, the bankers would have reached $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the other would have won $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow has pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow has suffered a imprisonment of six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper was imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a deposit of $1million each, which oblige them to live in the United States for the trial.
Enron, formerly seventh largest society national bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting, could no longer hide its billion debt or even propose its speculation phoney as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion loss of market value and more than $2 billion loss for the pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth lay and the former President general Jeffrey skilling were sentenced last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The accusations against lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have been in vain because of his death due to a heart attack last year.

In a clear effort to reassure markets irritated seen these new tensions linked to credit, Mr Kohn said that the recent turbulent has partly reversed "some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
If this hard turbulent persists, this would increase the likelihood of a further rigidity of the financial conditions for owners and businesses, A-t- it said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is prepared to inject new capital in the American markets, and that further cuts in interest rates could stabilize the conditions of credit.
These remarks have also enabled us to calm Wall Street with new even worse on the US economy, as the biggest drop in sales property in October.
The repercussions of this uproar financial has been accentuated following the declaration of bear Stearns, Investment Bank, announcing that it Licenciera 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to offset the heavy losses mentality to Paris losers mortgages.

England faces an appeal to the judgment by the criticism of Owais Shah and delighted Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the Batteur No 6 for England in Kandy this week, ending Owais Shah or pleased Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, President of Sélectionneurs which was exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to take its decision, and because the Bureau of Hugh Morris, President Director-General of England, beginning to fill the application forms to become a national team, at least part time.
Anyone who will not be able to win the Dossard No 6 will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to arrive at the top of his profession while another is not going to happen, in addition to the lower level, sometimes by bad luck more than by lack of power.
It is not that the cricket that the selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgement is subjective.
Is the right time to emerge Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah?
The same could be proposed in a different context, which choose between John Edwards or Banerjee' tubby'? both, new frameworks with good qualifications, professional, should be promoted, but there is room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a Cricketeur unless it is given at least a chance?
The figures are important in the decisions, but also the opportunities.
Has within a team, a Cricketeur must catch the eye of the captain, at the same time it must take the door and a Batteur must be lucky to reach the Cricketeur a day.
But catch the eye of Sélecteurs is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson that seemed certain to play the first test, although Stephen Harmison be declared in full form and continued to leveraging to serve.
Anderson has taken 32 first-class doors on 33 rounds in order to win a place.
Chris Tremlett has taken that 29 to the same average, but both of them have already had their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer.
If it will be Shah or Bopara who play at the stage Asgiriya, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build the career of a man, but that makes little difference.
Four years ago, Sri Lanka, Gareth batty has played in every test and has succeeded in the first, with five doors and 40 towers useful, but it was Paul Collingwood, who fought to emerge, which has managed to become the Cricketeur important of the test, and this, despite the fact that his double hundred marked against Australia in Australia can still be felt.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following a further discussion after the session today at the stage Asgiriya, certainly will follow their instincts Conservatives and promote more experience of Shah against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
For Shah, his brilliant and considerable beginning at Innings the test of 88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first-class against six for Bopara, which 22ans is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking the launch.
But Shah has only ten rounds in its two Innings in May against the Caribbean during the test, Lord city of its player of Middlesex, and that the immediate rejection by the Sélectionneurs when Vaughan again in form, Réclama place for the next game, seems to have distressed its elk if obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, the player of Essex is full of joy to live.
Nothing is fear on a ground cricket and it has exaggerated when it recently scuppered on a 4 during a presentation of Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
It has postponed that slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take its Vodafone (sponsor on) and call Alastair Cook, his équipier who looked by far, and ask s'' it saw that?'
Bopara is by far the best Batteur, its rate Filante enables it to make its services will, and TAOs with confidence and solvency.
Choose human right is one thing, choose the right moment is another.
Is it can be the true art of selection?
I would be conducive to give a chance Bopara, but that does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the leaves of tea suggest, it will be him who will play this week ending.
Buses bring people back to work, and to fight against Al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria came to Baghdad yesterday, dumping these exiles without money or without visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has returned to normal.
Some have returned to fight against the militants who have away from home.
Has the station bus Mansur, even before the arrival of Damascus 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses government official, the terminal was full of refugees in Syria and Jordan who have returned by their means.
"I have decided to go to Syria after they have killed several doctors to Baghdas" said Sabah, a doctor Al-qubaisi Sunni.
"I returned today because I saw on the TV and read in the newspapers what has happened to Baghdâd and since the city is safer now."
"they say that the Mahdi army is committing more crimes!' he said, referring to the militia of Shia militant Church Moqtada Al-Sadr, which has imposed on his men to remove at the moment.
Qassim Al Atwani, a Shia teacher of 38 years in the area of Amariyah dominated by Sunni, returned with his two children, because it could no longer renew his visa Syrian and because the regime prevents the Iraqi to work.
Its neighbouring Shia to Amariyah have called to inform her that the militia helped by the US, has made it possible to hunt Al Qaeda in the west of the capital, and have asked to return.
One of the new entrants of Jordan is the head of a tribe Sunni and Shia who has had to leave his House in Northern Baghdâd because of a grenade attack after he has led the people to revolt against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to return to combat.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me to have set up a militia anti Al-Qaeda to Sleikh, and that they needed to me and to my boys."
"That is why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years.
Many say that they have attracted by the growing calm in the capital since US troops arrived, and to the training of groups of citizens' involved' well armed and working together with the US military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say have been forced to return because of the problem of visa and decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi have fled the past years.
Salaam Al-samarrai, 51 years, father of three children, has expressed the suspicion felt by all on visas for exiles that Nouri Al-Maliki, the Shia Prime Minister, which would have asked the Syrian Government to limit to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have fled the country because of sectarian squads of death.
"We had no problem until Al-Maliki Vienna in Syria and encourages the government to give visas to Iraqi, forcing them to return to Iraq" said the pensioner Sunni.
"I can not trust a government that supports the criminals who burnt my House when I left."
The drop in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been driven out of areas of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are minimal.
It is feared that a sudden flows of refugees increase again sectarian tensions and back the fighting.
Small Saarland, good training.
The lowest federal state leads training Professionelle, and even conspicuous by the international orientation of its colleges and universities.
It is only in an area that a deficit hanging over the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I Exliqué yesterday for the 50 time to a Non-sarrois, that we are not French" - that is the slogan that the lowest federal state, by self-mockery, poster for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saarland system, which is placed fifth in the monitor training institute for the German economy in Cologne.
And, by tradition, colleges and universities cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
So far, the students have the chance to complete their studies by a double or triple a diploma.
Witness the Quotitée high of 15.6% of foreign students.
The Saarland led by elsewhere too children in the country until the colleges and universities in number higher than the average - many of them without a diploma of the gymnasium.
"In Saarland, use of the system of vocational training," said Axel Plünnecke, an expert in training in Iw.
More than one in five young gets its way of studies in a vocational school, and the Saarland stands at more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combination of vocational training and academic are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the panel double curricula is the second best of Germany.
Despite a practical training and a growing demand, the number of Diplomés engineering has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education Sarrois forced colleges and universities to a marketing campaign in matters of science of the engineer.
"After the initial studies Pisa, we celebrated a large number of reforms in schools general.", said a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
The government has introduced in all the federal State tests comparison.
To ensure that children are beginning to learn earlier, the last year of Crêche is free of law - a model that in the meantime other federal states copy.
Only future studies of comparison will show whether the performance of pupils are improving in a sustainable way.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the actual pupils risk has shrunk from 29 to 20%.
All in all, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarian do better.
And despite the general Sarrois, the knowledge in foreign languages are not measured by the PISA studies - one might otherwise gain points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbouring is compulsory in high schools, even if the Sarrois are not French.
Chávez rule the watches
In Venezuela, the case will soon be ticking other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will back the clock by half an hour in the South American countries.
Chavez meantime becomes a caricature in Spain.
As the Official Journal of the Venezuela's, owing to a new law, the case will be dealt with at least four and a half hours of time universal.
In this way, the countries South America gets a time zone which does not exist in any other State in the world.
The Anti-American Chávez justified its position by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
Moreover, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, owing to a matter of hostages.
The nationalist left-wing announced that as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remain President of Colombia, there maintain relations or with the head of state, or with the Colombian Government.
"I can already only because of my dignity," said Chávez who look forward a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the country oil will vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would strengthen significantly its power in the country.
The trigger element of this dispute was the decision to withdraw Uribe to Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with the rebels Marxists in Colombia.
Uribe would "typical" in the face of Venezuela with this decision, had criticised Sunday Chávez.
In Spain also Chávez is on everyone's lips.
A new bell of mobile phone fact fury in the country: "por Qué no you Callas" (why do you not Tais-tu) is the sentence that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the Internet.
It has been given by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, in the most recent Ibero-American Summit, was annoyed by the constant arrests of populist left-wing and it has said to remain silent.
A reduction in wages threat Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economy, according to a prognosis, a real Moins-value salary threat employees Germans this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the foundation Hans-böckler, employees should be expected in 2007 to a real reduction on their sheets pays compared with the previous year.
"The fault lies with the development of low wages, the increase in the value added tax and increases food prices and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for macroeconomic and research on the climate, the newspaper Bildt ".
New charges could also intervene on Assurance-chômage for the employee.
The Finance Minister peer Steinbrück said the newspaper' Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung "that the planned reduction of the Assurance-chômage of 3.3% for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the national employment agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation of funds or financial aid, in the words of the politician of SPD.
It has been able to Tuesday that the explosion in food prices and oil had pushed the inflation rate at its highest level since 13 years.
In total, prices have increased by 3.0% from one year to the next.
Venus is the twin infernal of the earth.
Despite its atmosphere hostile to life, Venus resembles more land than we thought until now, the European space probe "from" express has discovered flash in the atmosphere and Tourbillons of wind the Poles, similar to those that appear on the ground in the winter.
For almost three decades, scientists assume that there are flash on Venus.
The European probe "from express" has demonstrated today - it has detected electromagnetic waves to the limits of the atmosphere: the flash on Venus break out to a height of about 56 kilometres of cloud in cloud, relates Christopher Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "nature".
According to the famous theory of the Cyprine, the Flash would have revealed the life on earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there was life, it must have been a date to ancient history", explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie institution in Washington.
Today there should be little things living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times more dense that on earth, there is sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the twin infernal of the land, but it remains a twin," said Russell.
Why Venus, so that looks like to land mass and dimensions, was hit development also different, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The departure of "from express" in November 2005 was an important step in the research Vénusienne, since no probe was under way for the Exploration of the world since the 1980s ten.
According to the researchers, the most recent research results which have now been presented in several articles of "nature" point out not only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
They also show that the similarities with the land of our Planéte neighbouring are supposed to greater numbers than at first sight.
And researchers have found, in addition to the Tourbillons of wind already known to the North Pole, an eddy of clouds at the south Pole, which turns much more quickly.
The phenomenon reminds currents of air in the hemispheres land in winter, writing a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Di Astrofisica Spaziale E Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second Planéte of Sytème solar has almost the same mass that the earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres, almost as great.
The Planéte called Star of the evening or the morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it does move much more slowly on itself: a day Vénusien hard 243 days landowners.
Although Venus, with temperatures on the surface of 460 degrees Celsius and pressure of 92 bar, hardly ever calls the earth, scientists assume that the two Planétes have set in similar conditions.
On the two, water has accumulated and remained on the ground in the form of oceans, but has lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has set itself on the ground in the form of, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel meet with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for an end to the dispute parties about the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticised the SPD because of the attacks against the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and the sum grand coalition to end the dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not submit to the outside world a nation divided on this issue," said Köhler the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights are universally valid, even though I have respect for the differences between cultures" said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany should retain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, underlined the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against accusations that it would hold a new policy of China.
The German Chancellor has not distanced himself from the traditional policy of one China.
"China knows," said Köhler.
The Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed its dissatisfaction with regard to the reception of the Dalai Lama and was attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained of the "policy display" of the CDU in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery, irritations virulent became felt in the reports Germano-chinois.
The Chinese government has not only refused to take part the German Finance Minister peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to reports of Spiegel, has also frozen the dialogue said of strategy of foreign ministers of the two countries.
The head of the government of China Wen Jiabao now requires of Allemmande Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in office official, based Wen Jiabao and the Chinese position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama show that it is trying to separate China Tibet and other Tibetan Regiones, which also includes other provinces.
Schäuble warns against the riots such as those of France.
Street fighting with the police, firing, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against the riots such as those of France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that the social dissatisfaction in Germany breaking out in the streets by violence, has demanded the German Minister of the Interior.
Barricades which burn, violent of which are on the police with guns hunting: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that an explosive social Contitue is not also at home and defuses in violence.
We have to take this seriously, "he said the' Neue press" seemed to Hanover.
All young people not happen to cope with the rapid changes of the social reality.
The Federation, the Federal States and the common work already firmly to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
It would affect not only the integration of immigrants.
"Summits of integration at the conferences on Islam, this shows already its initial success."
But it would be too early to end a warning.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that in the suburbs German, there is no problem sociological or from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In the conurbations Paris of the North, young people had carried out serious street battles with the police during the recent nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burnt.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German Government, that is what is necessary for the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned that the "effects of imitation".
The situation in Germany would certainly not as explosive in France.
But it would still, however, a need for action.
Kolat emphasizes the fact that the quota of unemployed young people under the age of 25 years from immigration would be higher than the average.
We need to be more training places.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective'.
President communities Turkish added, however, that social control in families were more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must be careful."
We should quickly give young people the opportunity to participate in the work and training. "
Meanwhile, in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-bel, has remained very calm during the night.
Police units are in place, a helicopter hovering the area with spotlight.
The authorities have expressed posted three arrests and few cars and rubbish burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1000 security forces to ensure calm.
The police intervene as long as necessary, Annoncait the Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit of the race.
In the night of Tuesday, nearly 80 policemen were injured in riots in Villiers-le-bel.
In the night following overcrowded, unrest in Toulouse.
The riots éclatèrent after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the public prosecutor's office, the police is not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The entry into stage utopian of Chancellor shows that the coalition has ended with the substance and that there is nothing left to expect from it.
In which country is experiencing this Chancellor?
After his speech awkward in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor content, it must be said: not here, not in the countries that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The charge of too much focus on policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel a sentence harsh and arrogant.
That is provincial, has said and has just shown that it does not understand what the criticism.
In Parliament, it has made visible to all how this accusation was true.
There was no specific interest or feelings little for the problems of the country to be felt.
Instead, Angela is presented as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, who fled in foreign policy and even there remains in the few.
For example: climate protection in this regard, it welcomes again and again on the agreements Heiligendam, but does not say how the climate objectives must be achieved in our country.
Similarly, praise yourself - have so little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have refused even two years ago.
Now it is clinging to formulas, that growth would affect people.
Thus it destroys his image as a pragmatist, which solved the problems instead to embellish the world.
But in the empire of cloud Angela, the internal political problems are a rubbish marginal.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-paid workers?
It still has a few sentences accessories for this.
Here is indicative of the number of times it makes slip of the tongue when it comes to child allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three Démarrages for half a sentence.
It unsteady into unfamiliar territory, from the moment when it becomes practical.
The branch attack
In the debate of Youtube candidates Republican presidential, the two favourite Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard battle offensive and must now fear a candidate outsider.
The tension candidates breaks out already in the first.
It would have made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants, accused Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
It against for its part by heavy criticism: "I would say that its own House was a haven for illegal immigrants responds Giuliani and accuse the former governor of Massachusetts to have used undocumented immigrants.
The candidates amount to the attack: as the basis Republican also has no favourite official, the eight candidates for the presidential use of debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
Films fans 30 seconds Internet users have sent via Youtube are of little more than Souffleurs.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we have left Hitler come to power", is launching John McCain to its candidate Ron Paul which is the only in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also happens to lecture vigorously by the veterans of Vietnam, when it refuses to condemn torture as what is known as "waterboarding," a method of interrogation which the appearance drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign in the meantime go beyond the war in Iraq and debates on torture is in the reactions of the Chamber common of St. Petersburg in Florida.
That conservative values are leased or that increases future of taxes should be rejected, the applause into in the auditorium.
This is once again reveal where the weaknesses of two favourite.
"I made a mistake at that time," explains Romney contrite and present his apologies to the basis and the public television in 1994 for having been a supporter of abortion.
Giuliani instead in a crux in response to requests conducts its opinion on figures interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf rule for the first time in civil.
One day after its withdrawal as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, to be able to human Pakistani Musharraf has been invested as President.
And eight years of domination by the army that concludes.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf has been invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television has broadcast live the ceremony in the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he had submitted its burden of head armies to his confidante Ashfaq Kiyani and Etait and bowed to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after its seizure of power by a coup without bloodshed, the former general is now for the first time as head of marital status.
By the withdrawal of the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had declared on 3 November.
Already shortly after his investiture Musharraf will stand the state of emergency, according to the Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus meet another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, that Musharraf had occupied after the creation of the state of emergency with lawyers of its ranks, last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
In the meantime five soldiers were killed in the region tribal Northern Waziristan northern in an attack on a military convoy, and four other injured.
According to indications of the spokesman of the army, a bomb exploded in a street near the border of Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are their return.
The Supergroupes Germany Rejouent of the 1970s: the three Members of the Group Harmonia have again taken their reassured in a concert in Berlin.
For their return are appeared recordings of their great success' live' 1974.
Even at that time, they were well best-known abroad.
The feeling planned happens then in the form of three gentlemen announced to the poster of the evening.
Everyone has a small `in front of him, his cable and above all its buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, throne in the Middle in a white shirt like snow.
It is kick from the left of Michael Rother, young 57 years and in possession of a laptop and a Guitare.
From the right, observed by all the auditorium, Hans-joachim Roedelius, 73 years, curve on its reassured.
Everyone contributes to noise, among other even a beat.
And sometimes it adds inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to disturb too the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Group Harmonia plays again assured few distress among fans Krautrock.
It has the right to disclose here: targeted surveys show that, of course, the name thinking in the collective memory of the MAGP, but not as sustainable for this group also lack painfully for 32 years.
But why the German would it not also have the right to celebrate its living legends of the 1970s?
All the more so because this misleadingly called "Krautrock" has increasingly liked in England and America than in the country of origin.
Lorque the music industry awarded in 2003 the price echo the survivors of the group of Cologne can for their work, we have seen the faces in the Chamber pop German interrogators.
When the red hot Chile peppers have also thanked the groups the Düsseldorf and Neu! in praising's surprise, no longer had limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother come on the scene of red hot Chile peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the Transfiguration into the unknown is the only.
The memory is already taken by Harmonia, because the trio has existed only two years and that during this period, the power to impact is felt was weaker than the allocated to it later by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler as very promising cluster.
We played first in the cellars below the stage Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidised by the Church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly Dépanné in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name as Guitariste with Neu!, which was at the time perhaps the German group the more radical.
To 1973, Rother followed, however, the musicians of cluster in exile in the Fôrets of Weserbergland.
Here, in a former firm of Weser, a ruin of 16 century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the Community "Kommune, where I Roedelius had the right to hurt as a nanny.
A life rather artistic in the way of Spitzweg.
Supposedly was in the dustbin a flag of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for the art.
Many Retint Harmonia far from it.
The first Smiths is called "Musik von Harmonia", and this "luxury".
Because also calm and small that its music, the group suffered misery material.
The harvest of dead wood to serve no alone in search of itself.
The CDs' live' 1974 which has just sound was recorded at a concert to Griessem before a public record of almost 50 head, as someone believes remember.
Rother issued at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius a requirement immoral.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother Atterit in the spheres of the esotericism and Assura its existence with Albums as "Flammende Herzen (" hearts in flames).
Cluster is Réanima in the 1980s and has since more successful that Harmonia has ever had.
Should the Smiths live of Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its label Grönland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been dug up on that occasion as the film Roedelius staff.
The resurrection of physical Harmonia takes place at the House of cultures of the world in Berlin.
Subsidised publicly, within the framework of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian cope is, the British, former punk and author of the book of pocket' Krautrock Sampler ".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. washed.
By which all of the fluctuation band of the influence of Krautrock would be identified with regard to the POP future.
The operations left behind by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno hangs in the Chamber in the middle of sounds strange: "the only real music, you listen to the future'.
There are photos that show producers with Harmonia in the room of the firm.
The projections other photographs in black and white tools cable in bazaar used to the training of the legend.
Before, the three veterans are again occupied to improvise.
But more and underpants of microphones to the high and the battery, to draw the instruments of sounds unbelievable thanks to the instruments to effects built oneself.
Today, the electronic music is like the music electronic.
The three major Fignoleurs of technical.
To even the choir of the House is not altered.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we coughing and whispers under the cloud of sounds, and it sings to a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" emphatically.
Krautrock has always been a concept very English.
It has never comes to rock.
The roots have been less looked in the blues that in the conservation of music (can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic conventions or social (cluster).
Whoever shouts' 68 "has not totally wrong, and Harmonia also leaves no longer irritate it by now.
But what is most itself will be covered in detail on the scene.
Where music begin and end?
This can rap on the nerves of someone (?) or grant closes moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not enough cynical.
With "the hunting party" and "peace murderous", two films again address the war in the Balkans.
But the two are not convincing.
The projects are based too much on the action and on the exchange of firing is senseless on the contrary they are too Larmoyants.
Here, even Richard Gere in "the hunting party" can not help.
The good news first: the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely here, in the hinterland most dismal of the war in Bosnia, that the player Richard Gere is found.
We finally lost sight of the best man of the 1980s, because too many roles Gentillets and Futils in films to feelings for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have pleased the desire to be.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look after' the hunting party "- when the hunter becomes the driven (why films today should be as long and confused that collective agreements of train drivers?)
It gives a magnificent representation full of Clins of an eye: basically, his figure to postpone war Simon hunt is what Gere could have become, if the destiny and industry films were not as kind: a man who has the best of times behind him for a long time, but who, even as a monument ruined its decline, however, has kept visible remains of its former charm.
But despite this asset, "the hunting party" goes together with the German production "peace murderous' fate, which also this week, following lengthy films failed on the war in the Balkans.
"Peace murderous" can be done quickly the trial: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), save a Serbian of freelance Kosovars, in which one of the two promptly fall in love.
Although it is appropriate for the Serbs here are for once not presented as the only causes of all evils, this film also flat that a Téléfilm is lost far too quickly in the action and the exchange of firing senseless.
This remains a sort of "alarm for Cobra 11" without motorway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "the hunting Party," why basically there has never been a real good film on the war in the Balkans.
The history of the three American war reporters, who determine trail for the high war criminal' The Fox', could have perhaps become, with another director and another scriptwriter (both both Richard wrote) on another occasion, a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are the same so striking: two male will in small team in the forest, to do something that the military can not do and for both male, it becomes a trip to the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "the hunting party" is that it leaves simply not Simon hunt be the cynical deserted with a heart, as presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also give it a romantic adventure with a Bosnian murdered.
Then "the hunting party" becomes definitively bad, when the delay, in the space of the last five minutes, by a process speeded up, succeeds in NATO, the CIA and all the premium hunters of the world have failed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave in a just revenge the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that we should seize the International Court in The Hague of crimes against the logic film.
In this case, the film has a concern human too deep.
It wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and it suspect the Americans and the French (here they have to be exceptionally agreement) not lead hunting fairly intensive because of political agreements secret.
But the well-intentioned and the villain this time are so similar that a famous Poême of Brecht comes to the idea.
That speaks with a wooden mask a demon Asian working on the table of Poête: "compassionate, I see no front swollen, as is clear: Fatiguant to be bad."
Films such as "the hunting party" have exactly such head Tumescentes, but that implies the Fatiguant to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the war in the Balkans.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were major flops.
We can add: there has never been a good films on South Africa.
What is true every time: when a star lagging behind on a trouble spot or on a minefield, then it leads to something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina beautiful "or" Blutdiamanten "with Leonardo Dicaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have always gone before Hollywood can turn a good film on the Holocaust with "the list of".
Some films are even mature, those who are now classic works on Vietnam "the deer hunter," "Apocalypse Now" or "stop metal Jackett" have by no means been unanimous in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know today also simply too on the conflicts of the world, where every massacre is directly on two screens at the same time at home,
And this pleased to Scénaristes the lack of sensitivity they need to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "the dictator" are in fact become as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not know yet how the Nazi regime dominated really.
Perhaps we should not attempt to be good when we want to do good Flims.
Perhaps we must have our eyes artistic sarcastic and farther of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he asked on the parallel between his historical novel "dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he said: "It is up to the fact that some things never change".
"The big cities are still appallingly dangerous, men will always be murdered a Facon Horrifiante and war still reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust harvest criticism for the cancellation of traditions.
The decline of the mayor of with the application of Hamburg for the summer Olympics met in politics and the economy to fierce criticism.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the edge of the water.
But von Beust call for realism in the assessment of opportunities.
The main director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-jörg Schmidt-trenz, described Wednesday a departure as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has deployed so many forces in the city of motivation that the idea of traditions.
"Without this objective, the momentum Politico-sportif could not have been maintained under the same measures".
Schmidt-trenz urge the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes as its starting point another agenda changed".
The Mayor Ole von Beust not on Wednesday at its previous declarations, that the ambitions Olympic Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2000/2028.
"It's not Hamburg who decides to applications to the traditions, but the Federation German Olympic sport" said von Beust to Welt online.
It refers to the decision of the Federation expected at the beginning of December Sport, on the application of Munich for the winter games of 2018.
This preference means for us, that, in the time that we anticipated until 2000/2028 until then, we will have no chance. "
However, the dream is not definitively a thing of the past, said von Beust.
The sports federation of Hamburg (Hsb) lamented the statements of Beust.
Of this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wishes to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to ignore an opportunity, ground projects already now", said on Wednesday President of Hsb Günter Ploß.
Abandoning the application would be more at odds with the statements by the leader of the Senate on the occasion of reception in the plenary assembly of the Federation of German universities of sport.
There, von Beust would have described the candidacy of Hamburg to Universiades 2015 as being "not a substitute" the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of universities of sport was first in the past weeks Hamburg nominated as candidate city.
The SPD fraction of the mayor has criticized the Senate for not using this valuable time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of small Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because he has played the card of traditions and ruled out the construction of housing," said the delegates of the SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for the small Grasbrook a plan integrated into the traditions and subsequent uses of housing, the CDU would have relied solely on the "factor event".
's candidacy for the Summer Olympic Games in 2012 would for its part raised in Hamburg much enthusiasm.
Hamburg had, however, broken against Leipzig.
It is not the coffers of Warhols.
That linking the concepts Sweden and cash in wood, think Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or?
At the moment, funds wooden manufactured in Sweden cast of shadows on the list of works of Warhol.
Many of the ninety Brillo-boxs type of "Stockholm' catalogued there are counterfeiting.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" has questioned the authenticity of a few months ago Brillo-boxs of the year of 1968 Andy Warhol, the research of internal Moderna Museet Stockholm result today a result Désenchanteur: the six "Brillo-boxes", including the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten gave in 1995 to Moderna Museet, are copies, and many of the other hundreds of Brillo-boxen type of "Stockholm", circulating on the international market of art.
History is fairly, a disconcerting sequence of artistic production and Curatoriques.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York its first "Brillo-boxes", funds wooden painted, based on the design of Rouge-bleu-blanc boxes of soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work Moderna Museet presented in 1968, with the agreement of Warhol - hundreds of funds Brillo made of cardboard: they came from outside (for financial reasons) by Warhol, but had been delivered directly to the factory Cartonnage Brillo.
It was not of works of art, but rather of their models, samples of exposure.
At the same time, Warhol had authorised in 1968 to produce a few coffers wooden Brillo in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today talking about some fifteen coffers wooden which at the time would be right inflows in the history of art and auctions, as Brillo-boxes original of Andy Wahrol permitted, with the Appelation' type Stockholm ".
Some of them have achieved in the auctions more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum Pontus Hultén claimed, wrongly, as recently as about a hundred coffers wooden had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then pass.
In truth, the 105 funds Hultén have been produced in Malmö only in 1990, for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
On that date, Warhol was already death for three years.
Lars Byström, leader of the Conservative Moderna Museet, has examined, in addition to six Brillo-boxes museum, three other of private collections Suedoises, including two have been Confectionnées in Stockholm in 1968: their panels Stratifiés were first printed and Poncés, then it has been applied with a them of oil paint white.
The texture copies which date from 1990 reveals that the painting has been directly applied without layer on the panels Stratifiés, with a scroll of paint, most of it is not an oil paint, but a Acrylique.
"These funds have not been authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Brillo-boxes of Andy Warhol" suggests, the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "if the' Andy Warhol art authentication board' in New York is not just another decision, the Moderna Museet classified the six funds in its collection as copies / material exposure."
Already in July the authentication board has, of course, announced it into on the "serious accusations" that will be raised in the case of funds soap powder.
But since we psychotic there a Inéxorable silence.
