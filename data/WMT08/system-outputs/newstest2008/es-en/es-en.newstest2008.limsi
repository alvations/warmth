European inflation slipped into food
Inflation accelerated, registered in the euro zone, it must first of the rapid growth of the price of food products.
The rising prices in November has been above expectations in the 13 countries of the eurozone, registering - after the 2.6 % of October - Annual inflation of 3.1 % - announced the statistical office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were just as likely a 3 % - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike American central banks, British, Canadian and not cut the basic interest, under the pretext that the decline, along with rising prices of raw materials and forced to reduce unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least around two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the trap 22: "We must negotiate" on inflation for which subsequently will not intervene in this matter.
Inflation 3.3 %, recorded in Germany, beating the record of 12 years, whereas in Espana increased from 3.6 to 4.1 %.
Inflation shot in the eurozone as a result of the rampant food and energy prices.
Contributions to end of wheat rose by 88 % and also share soya reached its highest level since 1973.

The price of crude oil on the world market rose this minister in 52 %, reaching the last month the black gold almost 100 dollars a barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will 2.1 % to 2.5 %, whereas for 2009 already decrease 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the coming 3 or 4 months around 3 %, however, the average annual rate will be 2.1 %.

Gallup provides a government crisis
After a long stagnation, for the beginning of December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - 13 % - in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of voters certain parties - due to the greater strength of opposition voters would support - of more than two-thirds (71 %) with the support of a fifth for the Socialists (20 %).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats not met or the limit to have some escano: its support within the entire population is 2 %.
Among voters safe is one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared with the previous lowest point - has never been so high, 41 % the proportion of those who judged particularly bad the country's economic situation, while another 46 % believes that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after expectations more hopeful of spring and summer, now are more pessimistic about the change in their own economic situation.
With regard to the minister east, the majority of the population with the deterioration of the situation and only one-tenth expected an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those questioned, figure than any previous Gallup poll, thought that the president of desempena government more harm than good.
13 % of those questioned hopes or have a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Orbán Viktor enjoys the support of 38 % of those questioned.
54 % of the population is not at all in the head of government and 27 % does not trust the president of the Alliance of the Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of shaping the political situation is that what proportion of the society thinks that it is possible to monitor discontent experienced Against the Person of head of government without a change of government.
While after riots last October Minister 35 % estimated that it would be desirable to retain power in the government and head of government, this ratio is only 20 %, while a relative majority (33 %) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterised by the fact that 60 % of respondents to the question of participation replied that engages probably and another 20 % said that is likely to participate.
By way of comparison, in "general elections to be held this Sunday" participate with security only 55 % of the population and another 15 % believes likely their participation. On the basis of the current intentions of voters there is no doubt the outcome of the referendum.
74 % of the population dim view the payment of the rights of studies, 79 % of the medical consultations and 84 % hospital care.
If we look at these proportions solely between participants safe in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 % of voters would reject the introduction of the rights of studies, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The more expensive Auchan is, Tesco has its price fivefold
Held the average increase in the level of prices of 16 % supermarkets commercial triangle gold Budaörs, with the difference that this minister has not been increased VAT.
Gazdaság Napi article
The minister also increased by an average of 16 % in the Triangle Trade Budaörs gold standard canasta the Napi daily Christmas, but in all supermarkets growth recorded a far larger than the HUF billion.
And in December last minister had already been "fired" prices in supermarkets, food is not underwent a drastic increase in comparison with the high point of departure.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that the last minister could buy at a price well below the HUF nine thousand we can do so either by ten thousand.
The Napi canasta of in supermarkets studied topped with a minimum of HUF 91 psychological limit the HUF ten thousand.
Canasta and the highest value was HUF 10 573.
(Canasta Minister 2003 6800 cost this HUF.)
The price of spirits unique event and fish remained almost at the level of the previous minister, but there was a sharp increase in steak pechuga of Turkey, nut and seed poppy.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed data from the Central Statistics Office, Auchan but also have found one kilogram of Bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of redimible bottle Coca-Cola with two litres cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only HUF 257.
However, canasta in the Auchan Napi of was the most expensive, Cora as the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with regard to prices last Christmas, Minister of Cora increased with 15, while Auchan Tesco and with nearly 18 % prices listed Napi canasta of.
Comparing the values of canasta more expensive the minister past the canasta cheaper this minister, the difference was 12 %, while growth between the cheapest of Minister past and more expensive this minister has been a 21 %.
The average growth was HUF 1480.
The minister past the average growth in prices was HUF of 1206, so that during the last Christmas the minister in prices was the VAT increase.
This process was which shattered trade, visibly supermarkets were unable to take decision on the room for prices to apply for each product and calculate the effect of changing prices on consumption.
(If the dealer makes bad speed the movement of a product, may lose a significant profit margin which conforms to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of Napi canasta of the extreme reached such a result of increased VAT, which was the most expensive 1720 Upper HUF value recorded in 2006, while in the cheaper the difference was just a HUF 844.
This happened not Minister such extremes, since the highest price of 1630 now has been HUF more than the last minister and cheaper also increased with HUF 1284.
Comparing the two navidenas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months in supermarkets, grew more than 30 % in the price of goods consumption.
(However this does not necessarily confirms the figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some foodstuffs recorded in the 12 months a price increase over 30 %.
For example, in addition to the wheat, also in the case of egg.)
Canasta of the Napi, in the latter case that seems almost impossible, because the price of the product that was already quite expensive Minister past compared to the basis, recorded in the worst cases barely 10 % increase prices.
According to all the meal suppliers have a stronger position than the egg, which could impose the sharp rise in prices even multinationals.
Supermarkets not complain in the Golden Triangle Trade, constantly talking about positive results.
According to our experience garnered the majority of consumers visited three shops, no longer interested in prices.
Of all products buy large quantities, paletas food for retained.
On Wednesday, Manana shops in the three large queues formed ahead of the boxes because suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that in the country's internal sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain institutes survey because incomes are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in appliances.
In many hospitals saves with disinfectants
This minister have been reported in hospitals several thousand infections caused firstly by misuse of antibiotics.
Hygiene conditions pervade hospitals, overcrowding of caged and overloading staff not encourage infection control - médica-jefa of the Department of National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals saves even with disinfectants.
Not long ago has been diagnosed with MRSA contagion in the department of János traumatología Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident was detected the presence of the bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in the same hospital at the beginning of the minister.
A wounded a serious car accident gave high the hospital and the same patient shortly after due to return to the hospital with MRSA infection and since then has not been able to make an important surgical intervention by the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this minister in the Nosocomialis National System 1094 Surveillance in-hospital infection cases of multi-resistant produced by agents Karolina Böröcz - said médica-jefa unit, national centre for epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals certainly has recorded this amount of infections caused by agents, the other multi-resistant is information.
Nearly two-thirds of 683 infections (cases) are caused by MRSA, namely the Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to the meticilina-oxacilina.
One-third of human beings Bear in their nose the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus of (SA) without causing disease.
Infections caused by the SA (for example: Muslim-Christian throat, cutáneas amigdalitis, infections, infections injury) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treatment.
However, once applied exaggerated or unduly antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, bacteria become very resistant to antibiotics and spread rapidly in hospital conditions inadequate.
Can cause serious hospital infections, for example infections wounds or endotoxic shock first patients with chronic transitional or immunodeficiency, patients with weakened body, elderly people or little weight.
In view of the János médico-director Hospital there is nothing particularly MRSA infection, the daily are these infections in hospitals.
We must not confuse the epidemic infection, MRSA is only Tibor absent, Nyulasi said - where their presence.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, nursing staff serviced in rubber gloves and mask and there are antibiotics suitable for treatment" - Nyulasi Tibor said.
Hospital patients are examined in advance to verify the presence of MRSA in his body, but even they can prevent infection in all cases.
It is fashionable sample
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, but the circumstances are not conducive to National Hospital for the prevention of training and spread with pathogens multi-resistant Karolina Böröcz - says.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and homes for the elderly, hospitals should examine patients hospitalized and isolate immediately following the enfermes in your body the MRSA.
However, Hungarian hospitals is the sampling micro-biological.
This is also the national health box not funding these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when public already MRSA infections of visible in the patient - médica-jefa said of the Department of epidemiological centre.
The European Union is encomiendas for the rigorous application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological tables.
Empenarse is that with antibiotic therapy directed or should be done microbiological tests to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always comply with this requirement.
The sampling micro-biological are even rarer in the case of mobile patients or basic assistance Karolina Böröcz - said.
Saves with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases of MRSA or a patient to another through medical staff.
Therefore, desempenan a very important role the laundering of hands, the use of rubber gloves and masks, but also in this respect are experiencing considerable errors in hospitals.
The MRSA or through the transmission by drops and direct contact between people, but the National Hospital circumstances is not always possible to isolate the patient contagiado.
Moreover, the hospitals are often overcrowded, beds are often very together, but to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least for a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately it may experience - Böröcz - Karolina added in hospitals in less favourable economic situation saves with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and why there is a greater likelihood for the infection.
In the view of Böröcz, where Karolina is appropriate preventive measures, there are fewer such infections or it can stop the transmission of agent.
Government program against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection with huge spending is for the national endowment insurance, so that all countries fight against him.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
Apparently the programme has successes, according to data supplied, with MRSA infections show trend of decline in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) diseases among its priorities is the prevention of multi-resistant actors (among the MRSA) and hospital infections that are due to these pathogens.

Similarly can be appealing the capital Sofia, commercial spaces office and promise a swift recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is in the best way to become one of the most attractive havens for Europe's golf and a destination also highlighted during the other two stations, in addition to the summer and winter.
Therefore cautious investors are already doing their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the view of analysts, those who buy property in Bulgaria, are trying to change their lives and their way of life.

Fodor and six by hundreds Hungarians
According to the minister reported Hidrología environment and Gábor Fodor meetings at expert level will end Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at ministerial level on the international climate regime post-2012.
Pundits and politicians from 192 countries of the world deliberating on the roadmap of Balí available on efforts after the period of reducing emissions, established in the Kyoto Protocol, which runs until 2012.
Currently underway animated discussions about the particular between developing countries and industrialised.
The United States has already indicated that it now wants to negotiate about precise figures, although tends to reach the agreement that compared with the situation in 1990, the minister until 2020 undercuts 25 to 40 % gas emission responsible for the greenhouse effect.
Another major theme of the conference is that if the industrialised countries, and reduce emissions are or not ready to offer technological and material assistance to countries that need it.
An agreement was reached also on aid to developing countries.
The facility, laid down in the Kyoto Protocol, will be run by a board of directors composed of 16 members, probably within the global fund for the environment of the UN (GEF), writes the "Piac" is profit.
The six by hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister Hidrología environment and Gábor Fodor supports EU efforts to maintain its leading role in the global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister said that the EU undertakes reduce until 2020, with regard to the 1990 level by 20 % gas emissions, responsible for the greenhouse effect, regardless of whether or not the sign "post-2012 agreement" and is ready to engage in reducing even 30 % if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also ready to make commitments according to its responsibility and their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor noted that the signatories of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 undertook to reduce by 5.2 % within the then 15 EU Member States undertook to comply with an 8 % reduction.
The commitment of Hungary is decreasing with 6 % emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect in the period between 1985 and 87, that our country meet it - senala the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
Much is at stake in Balí, because within two years will sign the international agreement on the long-term climate policy, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force postpone post-2012. In this case the reduction commitments it made in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international system of reducing emissions, whose need was perceived in its most recent report by the IPCC, scientific association UN international dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
Thus, reducing emissions would suffer a delay and could not prevent an increase of over 2 O2 C, the temperature of the Earth, according to scientists should unfathomable and irreversible consequences.

The Air Force originally had loaded the videos with recruiting goals, but in the opinion of the Defense Ministry also help to show the public the objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
Such propaganda virtually costs nothing compared with the conventional TV spots recruitment - told the BBC the expert on defence Gordon Mackenzie - Instead, inevitably have some political message since, in a specific way justify raison d'être of military actions taken by the government.
Americans prepared a videogame
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to recelosamente recordings and abrogated, published in the distributor were also amateur videos, for example on the death of soldiers in the films: "Official propaganda," a little hypocritical, officers talk as maximum losses, without presenting however the bloody fighting.
Furthermore, the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have been charged by the Internet videos engravings already many real operations, but the British army only recently is taking this opportunity.
The Americans used a slightly differently for recruitment with the descargables video games charge shot so-called America's Army, in the midst of a situation more or less real player can be directly Instead of soldiers.

Political capital: in the country increases the risk for the Hungarian GUARD
According to the Division of Risk Analysis (division) Analysing all the political capital of the Hungarian guard, constituted in August of this minister with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, from several points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
"Warning about the risks of the companía" is written: in connection with the operation of the Hungarian guard the greatest political risk is the fact that " with the escalation of ethnic tensions that exist between the Roma and Sinti Hungary, even in the short term will occur violent ethnic clashes. "
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the Research Institute.
Claimed that this is one of the main faults the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "The protagonists of public life I gave public debate of the Roma problem to representatives of the political groupings radicals and extremists, who were basing its policy strategy on the discrepancies between Roma and Hungarian."
This exacerbates the problem, prevents any normal dialogue, empowers extremists and increases the probability of outbreak of violent conflicts - estimate.
In addition, according to research institute, the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly failed Hungary's image abroad, especially in regard to the stability and the country's democratic development."
Remind us that: from otono 2006 received increasing publicity and boost the reorganisation of radical groups and far-right Hungary and since the summer of 2007 were formed in the country many organisations which they define themselves "national associations of self-defense."
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organisations, while openly proclaim the training of its members to defence - even Armada - (civil defence national defence, defence of public order), alluding to the own inadequacies of the police, the army, i.e. the state" - added.
Said: all this occurs in accordance with the method that seeks to give a presentation civil different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction with politics and political parties.
Because stress civilian and form of partnership in the case of these partnerships not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal status, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian guard is a risk factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
" In recent months, in numerous neighbouring States referred to the Hungarian guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nacionalistas political figures of certain neighbouring countries, want to justify its own policy anti-húngara with the creation of the Hungarian guard.
All this has implications on the political stability of the region, " added.
According to research institute, the Constitution of the Hungarian guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that throughout the region were increased political risks.
They wrote that the Hungarian guard works in a similar way for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August of 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union UNB (far-right).
The Constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to massive riots Gypsies that occurred in one of the city's districts Poliana Sofia (Krasna).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to form the guard, arguing that the objective of the organization is "national self-defense."
In his opinion, in the last 17 years was "Gypsy" terror in Bulgaria, but the state remained impotent and indifferent to the facts - recalls the political capital.
Added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in the Bulgarian public.
As wrote, indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes which certain Bulgaria's Roma organisations have announced to resist, form its own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian guard so far have shown similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard, cannot be excluded that also Hungarian Gypsies reacting to the threat in a similar way, organizing its own self-defense - can read in the warning about the risks of political capital.
The director of investigations of political capital, Juhász Attila the question of the news agency said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the Institute of Research.
As you said, each minister published its risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the the risk to the public, as happened in this case, publishing its warning about the risks.
The festival is not always writes with red
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days writing with red in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the next minister less - reorganise themselves working days.
Even in the EU or uniform in America are parties.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday, state party and solemn days.
The solemn days essentially relate to religious holidays and historical anniversaries.
The minister new celebrate women: the last day of the minister old, as the prime minister of the new day is celebrated - the latter especially to relax the festejando who spent the minister old.
Throughout the holidays have eleven Minister written with red in the calendar.
Is a national holiday on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, Memorial Day of the 1956 revolution.
The 20 August had the foundation of the state, the virus May 1 Labour Party, 1 and 2 virus O2 November we remember our relatives and friends.
Moreover, in our country are two days celebrations of the Easter Whit resurrection, and Christmas.
According to the timetable, our state holidays, national or religious rarely coincide with a weekend, so often a bridge when before or after the festival there is only one workday.
In exchange for the alargados weekends, during the previous Saturday cannot leave from work or school.
The minister is working in his decree regulates specific when exactly change work hours later precedent or directly from the party.
This legal requirement is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not compulsory in change for business services and institutions which, due to their role working nonstop, even during the days of solemnity.
This minister working order can be changed only around Christmas and the end of Minister: from 24 December virtually stops life in the country, since experience, most people "a Bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the minister or take their vacations during these days.
The minister next several of our Christmas coincide with the middle or weekends, so that there will be fewer changes in working hours that this minister.
First is to change the agenda on the festival to work, for four successive days, workers can relax.
On Saturday, 26 April will be working hours in order to change Friday 2 may be festive day.
The other change relates to the feast of 23 October: Saturday 18 October, to work Instead of Friday 24.
Instead, the next minister during the year-end holiday Minister can rest, since from 24 December does not work in almost anywhere, even the last day of the minister is a Wednesday.

Lose interest if you want to meet the public's expectations
The car is moving ahead slowly in the usual backlog of Manana.
Sounds a bit extrano radio: violin with electronic effects.
Subo volume.
Change the rhythm of the music and the previous tones builds the low and then the voice of a female choir as a real gem.
The mr2 reproduces the channel love song of Wings of Zagar.
National musical life malcrió not much with electronic pop quality.
But now seems entirely different this backlog when you're listening to the Zagar of new disc.
Yonderboi appears. Some interesting new songs of National Digital Underground are gradually changing the image and although again fashionable style garage rock the guitarras, breaks, the National electro pop has shown: there are new under the sun.
Zságer Balázs began his career in the town of Pécs, lived in the whole of Yonderboi until began his career independent perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of a together.
With its Zagar project () and his music, a mixture of jazz, bailable electronic music and pop, tried to succeed, when soundtracks asked cinema (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The broader public joint published originally operated only in pequenos clubs when the wan2 selected magazine published its first disc in 2002 between the 50 most important national discs, classifying Zagar, together with Yonderboi as formateur almost the only national trends, capable of sold in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his whole are fashionable, but nobody asked them whether or not quite this label.
The whole reacted as must react: disc produced a new and even better.
The newly launched disc entitled words fly walk Instead can open new paths for them, although the title itself seeks to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
Because this title was one of the lines of the whole Zságer Balázs ancient.
The reference is well on the job, on the flight, but apart from the music itself, now appeared - in the spirit and the trend of the times - guitarra the sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs presented in the Millenáris disc György singer Ligeti, currently working in England with all the puzzle.
The disc includes a real success mr2 Pet Channel recently output fi Manana transmitted the night popular music station. This led to the ears of the radioyentes Music High Flying Wings of Love, engraved with six singing ivas ($1,000 Hungarian Underground ").
Because everything is in order (?).
Hvg. Hu Balázs asked Zságer.
Hvg. Hu: after this new success the question arises that you are interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a selected public?
Zságer Balázs: the definition of selected public means little for me.
In my opinion, there are two types of caste in music slight; not mainstream, not Underground and alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
The so-called Underground alternative music can be boring, senseless and also can be made only for sale, what makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from an inspiration sincere.
The behaviour of listeners work in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
Hvg. Hu: you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: abroad, especially the west of us, music slight has larger traditions.
This not only generations of 15 or 20 years attending concerts, but also the old.
Pay much more attention to the changes in its around music, because they believe it is part of contemporary culture.
Hvg. Hu: what role has the public in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are and how many people listening to your music?
B. Zs: I am naturally good to see that more and more people are our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
Not music for some odd objective, but for some reason.
The role of the public rather sit in concerts where there is a mutual influence, but it is just inconceivable changes at the time.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the public's expectations, lose their interest.
Hvg. Hu: to what extent pretendes follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career rather the west of us.
B. Zs: we do not accept their way, although sometimes try to compare our music with him.
US rather work as a team, we trust the musical presence and leaving to unfold.
Initially it was inevitable that compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, as many of us we started our careers in their group and hence embraced another route.
Hvg. Hu: on the list of mr2 successes Wings fi pet output of love is in the first place.
Many people heard the name of Zagar in connection with this song.
Concientemente Abriste does with this style to a broader layer?
Zs. B.: not intended to compose great successes and sell these successes with our disk.
This song is something more than that.
The agregamos at the end of the disc, trying to relax after the orgy resonant records and heavier issues.
Hvg. Hu: how has selected six singing?
Why precisely to them - what was the main reason?
B. Zs: the idea was to create a gospel choir style.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of solistas good voice of our own national music scene.
It created this chorus of six women - i.e. Kutzora Seine, Edina, Judie Jay Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enik output, [LEFT-BRACKET Juci Neo] Németh - and was later dubbed Divas of Underground.
Hvg. Compusiste Hu: how exactly the song or girls changed some things?
Zs. B.: this song was long ago as instrumental version when had all the material records, we believe that there is still something.
The atraía ode commensurate.
Even that night grabé the song later learned the girls.
All came almost the first attempt and incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was much then, but also of course needed Divas.
My voice had not worked with such force.
Hvg. Hu: both in the concert and disc seems as if girls were in second place.
There is no solistas (except for the brief only Judy Jay), have no role for itself, sing all together and not more sharply than music, for what music not only acompana their chants.
Scenario belong in the fund.
Is intentionally?
B. Zs: are basically simply by technical problems.
Instead deliberately wanted solistas to distribute roles.
The song is about this a while we forget our egos, who where has been and where he is, let us therefore allow those Wings, the Wings of the love we lift.
It wanted to ensure that others felt the euphoric mood we feel when we started this song.
Hvg. Hu: dedicaste What more work?
Zs. B.: in music composition actually no rather to spare mix was more difficult.
For example, Gray's Dorian dilemma that I am playing a piano concerto of Rock'n'Roll or goes to the girls, where over time would not operate the groove and then gradually began to all its place as a puzzle.
Hvg. Hu: what is your favourite song in the new disc?
Zs. B.: this is constantly changing with concerts and because I have "unleashed" disc.
Now the Prophet is to Fool the escape from the earth and never the same.
A traicionero corridor exchange risk billions for his inferiority complex
A malversador unfair.
That is as her former Kerviel employee, Jerome, the giant French banker, owner Société Générale bank's also Czech trade.
He lost nearly five billion euros.
However, it appears, rather, that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to be compared to his colleagues and certainly with good skills.
Intuyó long ago, unlike all the big banks Czechs, the crisis in the subprime market American.
"Is a fragile" was heard of their superiors, the same that sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel responses as contained the French media, as the newspaper Le Monde, is that this was a man who at the end of last year had a gain of more than 1.6 million thanks to their business.
Crisis not only in America
"Everything I wanted to do was make money for my bank" ensures in his answers.
In summer, managed to win American during the crisis, 500 million.
This opportunity already saw come at the beginning of the year.
In February began to listen to some news about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that these customers start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence throughout the economy.
Kerviel is not believed him and argued correctly.
And then, at the end of the year their profits exceeded EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I earned my first 500 million knew as Kerviel admitted being" and adds, that nothing has been left for himself.
During the entire interrogation declared that had distorted the records so that it was not his Discovery.
Even came to deceive the Heads, even when the Eurex stock began to look for their business.
The risk became benefit
Is feared to come to discover?
Rather, not.
"I thought it earned 1.6 million for the bank and that this simple fact, that I would be happy."
Where brought so willing to risk in this way?
In my position should work gradually.
Came to work in Société Générale in 2000, just after he finished study in Lyon.
His annual salary is made between the 51 dollars.
Two years later was already assistant bag and row in 2005 became corridor bag with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Still knew that was never going to win as much as any other.
" In my first interview in 2005 already noticed that I looked cautiously.
Because of my training and also my professional advancement and personal Kerviel described " researchers.
But the short time I came into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won over the bombings in London, playing a title of 500 million.
And this was starting a mechanism, and wanted more.
If we want to, you
"This is like a snowball" said the police.
But it says that the Heads knew all this, or rather the sospechaban.
"While chief earned the money."
Only after the coup, arrived at the beginning of this year.
In one, lost one billion.
After the weekend of January half wanted to remove all mark.
When the Monday came to work, no longer worked at the bank.
And after two Dias, the bank announced that it had lost 5,000 million for his fault.
And how localizarle managed?
Became suspect from their holiday.
" I chose only four Dias for the past year.
The corridor, which has no holiday is a corridor, which does not want anyone to a look at his dossier " Kerviel ended.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of achieving 365 billion
Government ministers of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes of the Czech Republic can achieve 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kronor).
It is hit areas of half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can gain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Seven operational programmes will be approximately 125 billion kronor for the regions.
Czech companies can get around 100 billion kronor programme enterprise and innovation.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The programme of transport is the greatest operational programmes and accounts for 22 % of the resources that the Czech Republic can achieve.
This money increases the state budget to fund transport infrastructure that next year will be the amount of 90.800 million kroner.
The programme of enterprise and innovation must serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in innovation business.
Companies should get financing for the purchase of new technologies, research for industrial and organizational implementation methods more effective.

Sentence of twenty years for the former president of Nicaragua, declared the court
The Court of Appeals in Nicaragua declared on Thursday the 20-year sentence for ex-president Slobodan arnaldo, the German Pais, which was sentenced in 2003 by the defalcation 100 billion dollars (almost 800 million kroner).
Despite this, following a time, was released from prison to house arrest in his finance not far metrópili Nicaragua.
Unclear at the moment, according to the agency PA, the then head of state and Central American 1197 between 2002, back behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Perez will depend more agents to prison if German finish their sentences at home or if they do return to prison.
Four years ago, the court traspasaba showed constantly as German government money to the account of a company in Pánama.
This society was fictitious and account belonged, in fact, their relatives and supporters cercanosT more.
Part of that money ended in the German fund created to finance his campaign in elections in 2001.
We passed the budget
It is.
The state budget was adopted.
Why is special, this budget?
It is the first produced by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was approved with the support of ČSSD, because the ČSSD Sobotka and minister could not allow not accept it.
Apart from various debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, nothing happened dramatic.
The parliamentary assembly in this traditional view although the most influential calmly, approved the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget line, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for comunicacón media and so I devote special attention.
Political discussions are much more interesting than the simple numbers.
The national budgets of recent governments of the Social Democrats suffered three defects that for this year 2008 is not possible to solve facilmente so:
The first is the high turnout of laws, known as compulsory expenditure of the leaders who are not only pensions but also social benefits last year were adopted before the election by the "silent ČSSD" coalition and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third is the deficit limit public funding, as the budget deficit municipal and community.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the budget deficit of the state.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the budget deficit municipal and community.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from taxes, fees and loans from the banks, often issued, pointless obligations which borrowed disproportionately to their local authorities.
In recent years managed to pay these debts through the selloff of energy and other networks of development that received state and privatisation.
Currently do not have this resource.
If we stick to the facts only official and verified that:
Our economy, a few years ago, passes through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, ČSSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government an order to state finances.
However, Instead of the state continued to borrow.
The rest of paises, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt economizaron, much more reasonably that our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, particularly in the previous government.
Belong to nations that within the global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why they are not necessary social mass programmes which, unfortunately, in inutilmente recent years hincharon measures are gigantic.
And although managed to eliminate the incomprehensible populist expenditure approved this year before the elections, if shortly does not change the retirement age and reform of pensions then really will be the end of any policy in this Pais and governs who governs only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that politicians who will govern officials, mechanical here most of taxpayers' money for retirement and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but cannot stop the pressure of normal expenditure expenditure proxy.
The deficit planned over 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the last government had not wasted in the last ten years they could.
Not want politicians who govern become officials only therefore we must be patient and give this weak coalition government that realises that the state can only spend what is capable of obtaining taxes and fees, tranquillity for the preparation of other reforms laws.
This will make only gradually achieving a balanced the state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British central banks, Swiss and Canadian chose to fight together against the market crisis of finance.
In monetary marking will be more than 100 billion dollars through licitaciónes.
In these tender banks auctioned off interest rates which are capable of providing money.
For example, the American EDF will send bid 40 billion dollars, and then another 24 billion will the central banks in Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks of 11 September, is the first time that central banks of different states agree on this process coordinated to protect and reduce the impact of the crisis of finance.
"This step to solve the biggest economic problem, namely the contínuo growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could provide" wrote in his report to clients, Bernard Baumohl consultancy Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action by central banks probably fell recession in the United States of 65 % to 50 % Baumohl" he added in his report.
Banks have already spent 60 billion dollars in unpaid appropriations, especially in the United States.
Economists expect still billions in losses.
"Central banks must really have fear what awaits them when decided to take this step," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that have the same problems of access to loans and that it will have to pay more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and would send the American economy into recession with different impacts on growth of the economóa world.
Central banks decided, after not managed to reduce the so-called Libor rate, London interbank rate used for the loan money in the interbank market.
This means that banks constantly feared paid money even when the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain reduced during the autumn its interest rates several times.
"Will have the same effect as a further fall in interest rates" told the Reuters news agency, Salvaggio Greg Tempus company Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised at the step taken by the central banks will contribute to the electric crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem is the demise of the real estate market in America.
Klaus: debates of environmentalists are astounding
Global climate change particularly affects the paises in development.
President Vaclav Klaus expressed again with regard to the problem of global warming.
The criticism arose now with the closure of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where Azúl presented his book, not green planet, commented that the debates environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organisations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There are scarcely debates are structured, fireworks substitutes, the solution to the current problems," said Klaus.
Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important for him and that is why interest.
Also expressed joy to discover his book translated into German as often said, "I am with only the caricature of my ideas."
Now people can obtain information about their varied opinions.
Klaus said that is not a climatólogo but which has, in his opinion, alleged as sufficient to write a book like this.
Is academic ability to continue with a dissertation and specialist judge has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the time chief expressed his closing thought that the climate is changing constantly, and its changes are normal on global warming there is an agreement between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not as large and serious or represent potential disasters and that attempts to influence the development of climate are useless, ineffective and costosamente unacceptable.
As with the man experienced totalitarianism seen as unacceptable impose unproven opinions to others, what feels like a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
Questions here repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable defenders of the environment but against militants environmentalists that do not take account of the cost-benefit ratio."
The same subject spoke Klaus in Vienna two months ago at the institute Hayek.

Bolek Polívka lost the case on the mark of Walachei kingdom.
According to the provincial court's good in Ostrava was the first used the kingdom of Walachei but the project was created for many years by Harabiš Tomas with the actor who worked.
Polívka was not presented today at the hearing.
According to his lawyer the cause has probably not finished and his client recourse.
"The case is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek popularity Polívka" said after the trial, Polívka lawyer.
For him, in the words of Walachei kingdom, everybody has been the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea has Harabiš also.
" We have been following us around ten years of work.
Quest for money and invention of activities, " he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is about money.
" After years I noticed that the project is successful and which therefore could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work, " he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court brand of Walachei kingdom was Polívka first in its television programme.
In 1993 was capped by the actor Brzobohat Radoslav ý.
Then it was not reorientation towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years after Harabiš to would publish the passport of the Kingdom of Walachei.
From that source was a funny business and a lucrative business which Harabiš created after society of Walachei kingdom.
In 1997, Polívka agreed in the use of his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders vistantes discounts to their farm and assistants their sideshows.
Who sit on the throne?
Today the good Harabiš also found that only used a simple idea that Polívka issued on the scene for their own benefit.
"Bolek is clear that Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Walachei" Good said.
He added however that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team which followed it completely.
Cooperation between the descompuestas parties today, continued until 2000 when Polívka Harabiš arranged for the Vsetín official coronation.
Since then began to be Polívka conflicts between Harabiš and whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "king Boleslav R, the elected forever."
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš led Jarmila in the Šuláková singer, as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka presented an accusation against Harabiš and its society which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the dispute, the tournament on the throne with their princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
It should leave the new king.
Did not reveal even more information or dates.
" There is no hurry.
It should be something like the king's path towards Moravia.
The king should be elected by a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can be Harabiš " he added.
Peugeot 207 TEST VTi: SW 1.6 outdated prejudices
To tell the truth I have never liked the Peugeotu 206.
Their characteristics gear were never anything special, the quality of the changes, and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now exists in the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
This so-called SW Combi is a little more advanced and to me, because I can only pensármelo better.
When probé the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, the area of the head in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the bodywork of Combi means in this respect, I will not suffer before the two metres.
Flying around the world
Step inside short not to repeat it too.
It is an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here the invention assessed more design although the car seems quite elegant.
Seats are comfortable, there are times when opposition from short seats and securities.
Also unlike 206 model, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here we can feel how have grown measures of the bodywork.
In the aforementioned Combi disappears shortage of space in the head.
Suitcases to boot
But the main in this vehicle is his boot.
This must evaluated as very accessible (thanks to portón backyard can fold) and a storage well distributed.
The estan dead spaces equipped with correas rubber which represent an ideal solution.
Not a nuisance, and can expand to restrain heavy objects.
But let us in the tank.
According to the tables in basic regime has a capacity of 428 litres in comparison with competition is rather an average value.
But when compared with the same kind of vehicle more sold in the Czech Republic Škoda, Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation model Mladá Boleslav, found that the Peugeot is lagging behind their perceptible 52 litres.
Holidays abroad or in placing the child's buggy its value is critical.
But if I had to say something positive, I must mention the apartment that is fairly level after shooting the securities second line.
120 marches in four horses
Our car was tested fitted with a encedido injection of four valves on a 1.6 litres capacity and a force of 88 KW.
To tell the truth as 1,600 should resemble a menospreciara the family that five doors.
Is silent, consumes little and above all, it has momentum.
If I compare this with the era of Škoda then it looked as if the exhaust pipe taponado was a rag, I can say that with this can be impressed.
Prices are
The price of the car is not for everyone.
However, we must Bear in mind that we tested a vehicle equipped gracefully and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the lighting of injection of 1400 by 329. 900 kroner, they still can.
Our aggregates evidenced 410.900 crowns from what is already too much.
The Premium rate tested already at other 80,000 kroner.
But tendriamos still in the air, air conditioning headwaters automatic, limpiaparabrisas automatic, traseras automated windows.
In other words, the car with all of 531.900 kroner costs.
It is much, but with supplements the team in Fabia and come to a number quite similar.
Now only have to decide which of the two brands.
Students Slovaks not integrate into English Schools
In English schools paises attended by children of Eastern Europe and therefore local people fear further changes in schools.
The integration of the East Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools registered cases where conflicts between immigrants and the children of natives increase in violence.
The problem of integrating children of Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent are starting to grow where conflicts between natives and immigrants Slovaks.
Estorsión discussions, broncas between students and have already reached even parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that the Chatmam police arrested a woman who was hitting Slovak sticks to a ten-year student green with a stick.
In its defence said that the Girl was abused her son with racist insults tone.
The police had to act after an attack two girls minors against a Slovak emigrant.
Agasajaron girls with him racist insults and jettisoned stones.
" When we were home, a boy approached to us from the bus and began to escupirnos.
When I told us what did quit hurling shrug of apples and pears, and then fell trousers and showed us their backyard, " another unpleasant incident described in The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the natives even appointing conflict with immigrants from Eastern Europe and fight for survival.
The cases mentioned earlier, we show as the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain are registered 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work.
Approximately 30,000 students attending Slovaks English schools.

For the vistantes is really the island of freedom.
Anything that wait holiday could reach meet, whenever eliga correctly.

In Havana arose buildings high, wide boulevards were cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway was bought a finance in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and Cojimar took his yacht.
In the walls of the Bodeguita of the left their signatures stars in the world of entertainment and politicians throughout America.
And today?
In the Bodeguita walls of the habanense you can leave your his autograph.
At the bar of the expensive hotel him the national cocktail mix according to their wishes.
And these religious cars of the 1950s, until today still operate in Havana, because those Lada who arrived and Fiat long have been corroded between these humid and salty winds.
Even if Havana, especially old neighborhood is deteriorating significantly, does not exist in the vicinity so many wonderful colonial monuments as elsewhere.
Metamorfosean elsewhere in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings both money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years grew not only new hotels in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and rocks as period period Coco William and others.
Cuba is still a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is very appreciated by rail lovers.
Sugar cane is transported from the vast plantations until sugar plants for vias close in steam engines or electricity.
Their garages for dozens of years cannot be discovered and there are now operating, machines and whose sister models in other parts of the world only are in museums.
Where to go?
The best-known place for most of the vistantes will not change.
And so it is not necessary to talk more about Varadero or Havana.
Perhaps only remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway finance is a museum for those who are lovers writer, must not fail to see him.
The Viñales Valley is the most scenic corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation grows on land that Rock Chalk.
Pilones Mogotes, Rock Chalk and rocks of escarpados high in the caidas Valley, grutas and their aclimatan are fertile land which roquedales forming behind dense vegetation.
The Valley is where grown, probably the best quality tobacco in Cuba.

Trinidad
Old City which was founded pedigree not long after that Spaniards colonizaran the island.
Slavery and sugar brought the fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with constructions in the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, particularly influenced by French settlers arrived later, in four centuries has barely changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray, is a place as paragraph that still in the 1950s last century there was road to join with the rest of the Pais.
Such isolation helped her to stay outside the rest.
Nothing new was built and it is therefore not destroyed, nothing, because everyone was happy to be where live.
If you get more time to be in Trinidad one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places around and the nearby Ancón Beach or the Valley sugar factories.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which encourages with their music the silence of the morning.
Baracoa
Small town in the far west of Cuba, some regarded as the finest of the island.
With certainty that view is already confirmed by the way.
The two roads that go beyond Guantanamo must move from on high quebradas mountains, and how a nature that barely knows the man-made.
This place eastern Cuba has been included as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its unbroken nature.
There are the best chocolate in his church have Columbus cross (it is actually a cross reached 100 years later the landing) and from the Hill, where the chateau and that there is now a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and including the most well-known, the anvil.

However, as they say, best ever seen.

Likened today before a court to Khartoum for having given a name to a Bear peluche of
The British teacher judged in Sudan to insult Islam has been condemned Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days imprisonment and deportation, his lawyer said.
British was accused of having left pupils from 6 to 7 years give the name of Mahomet to a Bear peluche of when any representation of the Prophet of Islam is inadmissible.

The election of the status quo
No surprise Sunday, exit polls: the Russians will opt massively for the poutine president's party, United Russia.
Confirming their quest for stability, even to authoritarianism, after a campaign very limited.
Three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today they directed voters a televised message on public broadcasting stations, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It as leader of the list for United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not transparentarse left receiving foreign ambassadors, by simply handing a new charge against the West accused of interference - his predilection issue during the campaign.
"We know the cost of genuine democracy and want honest elections, more transparent and more open elections without incident," he added.
According to the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
Denounces a campaign tarnished by pressure.
Guennadi Communist leader Ziouganov says there is no "never had elections so dirty, even in the era of Eltsin."

Whatever, the legislative elections and the presidential outgoing power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
"The Russians remained the mentality of Homo sovieticus, do not feel masters of their destiny," estimated the sociologist Goudkov Lev, director of the independent Levada centre.
The historian Kopossov Nikolaï, State University of St. Petersburg, goes back further: civil society held back in this country cristianizado five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After liberal reforms in the 1990s, "poutine restored the model of a nanny state, well accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a true economic confession," estimated Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "resign for personal responsibility" of those who had shown briefly following the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon is all social classes, including the world issues.
And the elite administrative thinks preserve the status quo: 65 governors (each 85 heads of Russian regions) directed local lists of United Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often sinónimas of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The prefers to stability.
On behalf of the Russians will not be voting by extremists.
Tcherednitchenko Tamara conclusion, Professor age 54 years: " Why reflect?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change? "

What I should be safe?
Car insurance, which covers the driver for possible disasters, represents a major expenditure depend on various factors such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, type of vehicle to ensure or the use of, among others.
Take the car is only the beginning.
And choose the right motor insurance is even more difficult to choose the type of vehicle.
Firstly we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and assured.
This commitment entails an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the value of the Premium agreed to change that will be responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The Premium is the price of insurance, which establishes taking into account various factors such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, type of vehicle to ensure or the use of this, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, more likely to suffer from an accident, larger share to pay.
It is for that reason that both the elderly of 25 as women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that have a lower rate of accidents due to their wisdom.
Furthermore, scraping of stock, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents that drivers singles.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency and the likelihood of having any hitch.
By increasing the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when they set the price of Premium.
That is why the driver has to study the situation to choose the Motor Insurance best suited to your profile.
Here the variables exposing more significant selecting one or another type of insurance, so that, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offered a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years are with various disadvantages to hire insurance at an affordable price, as are the driving experience in reduced and the age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well secured is a sure, there are other cheaper options.
More cautious drivers can opt for a franchise with all risk, so that they can get the insurance coverage to all risk but at a price more workable.
This kind of convention would Mean that the customer a part of the cost of the disaster.
"The amount of the sinister preestablecerá customers is depending on the value of the Premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," specifies Luis Noguera, head in Spain, first Europe insurance broker online.
Another option is a safe third expanded, so that the customer provides protection against damage to third, but not before the caused in their own car.
It would also covered for theft, arson and the loss of the vehicle.
A council.
If you're less than 25 years trying to be careful and avoid claims as far as possible, because that will bonus and reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the basis that owns the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on this charge basis.
" Subsidies and penalties will depend on the company and profit.
If the company has had a good year can afford to increase subsidies, " clarifies Noguera.
The strip last 25 drivers will be easier to hire insurance, because the fatality rate is reduced thanks to the experience.
For this reason, it is more sensible to recruit any risk with franchise.
"Normally young people cannot make use of prior experience gained in use in an accident, and even when driving," ensures the director in Spain the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving past, once 'miedo of the novato'.
However, if the customer is married but still has no children is preferable to negotiate insurance, provided their economic situation allows, of course.
For its part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with a lower rate of accidents, so that deposits will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one to any risk with franchise and this (300 euros), or when there is a high level of bonus, one third extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"Do a more relaxed and driving have greater purchasing power to afford to assume a greater amount of franchise," judgment Luis Noguera.
For retirees is advisable to insurance risk with this franchise (150 euros), or one third extended when there is a high level.
I must say that the motor insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver before possible disasters, but also because it represents a major expenditure, which is why it is essential to consider properly insurance that suits us more in our personal situation.
The Celtic looks in Milan a point that is the eighth

New fears over gas between Russia and Ukraine
The dispute growing gas price between Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk of fuel exports to Western Europe by Russia.
The majority of gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is addressed through Ukraine, so each stood between both nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay fees higher transit.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to the EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow wine with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money to be paid Ukraine for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said that claim more to Ukraine, because it has pledged to pay an extra 50 % in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that could be that Ukraine pay 40 % more for imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important journeys for gas during the talks," said the Ukrainian economy minister Anatoly Kinakh to the Reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not be linked to our arguments on levels in transit charges [LEFT-BRACKET towards western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major dispute over gas between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which rose rapidly prices.
Russian gas around one-fourth of supply of the EU.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply of gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
" Must prove NHS workers foreigners '
The Scottish NHS needs to check the records of employees from outside Europe, said one policeman.
The recommendation of the Auditor General Robert Black came after it transpired that a doctor abroad was related to the attack on the Glasgow Airport, in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the amount of foreigner staff.
However, his report said other controls carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The chequeó General Auditor the number of staff employed outside the European Economic Area, following the attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, a hospital doctor Iraqi Royal Alexandra of Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep clash in the courtroom airport terminal.

Although the College of Health of Scotland uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out controls criminal record, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The report recommends auditor general, among other measures, joints that should have the leadership of Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal checks in many countries outside Britain.
"Although there are some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black says that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with their own employment policies, but reads: "Our report highlights the areas that can be improved to ensure that it has the necessary information on the number of staff of the NHS."
The president of the BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "highly unlikely" that the pre-empleo screening of potential can identify NHS staff that could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that the pre-empleo screening of NHS operate in Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations," explained.
Health authorities declare that currently Scottish 1.161 with foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, partly because joints have problems in identifying what employees with indefinite residence permits.
The research also found that verification procedures laid down by the authorities in Ayrshire NHS Arran, and Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian widely were being met.
This includes passport controls, work permit and check-up qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing politics and pre-empleo guide of foreigners in the NHS.
The secretary of health, Nicola Sturgeon, declared: " Had a great interest to carry out this work following the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the Board of Health, could consider the recommendations of reports and that this will be reflected in updating guides pre-empleo control for all working groups - including foreigners - what they had to publish next month.

Saudi Arabia arrested 208 terrorist
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that militants arrested 208 terrorist cell planeaban that an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks against religious and security forces.
State television supplier of oil to the world's largest said that cell was planning smuggling of missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathisers have mounted a campaign against the monarchy local alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of militants consisting of eight foreigners it planned an attack on an oil installation in the eastern province, the report stated television.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the Abqaiq plant oil plant, the world's largest, after a failed attack al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, quoting a statement from the Saudi interior minister, said that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a "expert in launching of missiles," which has entered the country.
The minister said that militants had planned the entry for smuggling eight shells.
Other 22 detainees were planning assassinations of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned the religious leaders who should be more active to arrest the Saudis who travel to Iraq to join as for Al-Qaeda militants to fight the allied forces and to endorse the Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by Saudi Sunnis more extremes.
Al-Qaeda militants have targeted many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.

Climate of Venus can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have once been an appropriate place for life, said scientists yesterday.
Data from a European manned spacecraft into orbit showed the planet more like a sister of the land of what had been noticed previously.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago may have played Venus conditions similar to those that made the Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and solar rotation slower sent Venus at a rate of development very different.
Today the planet has water, the temperature at the surface is enough to melt lead and it is being eroded by the hurricane winds and high storms of rays.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, who has studied the planet for one year, offers a picture of how the land could develop changes to cause catastrophic climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, department of physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the mission Venus Express, declared: " Becomes clear why the climate in Venus is so different from the earth, when two planets are so similar.
"Our new data make it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago."

Still remains open
Mitt Romney says that is not dignified presidential candidates answered questions from one monkey snow.
However, the Republican candidate for the presidency possibly agree to hold a debate on Youtube, where ordinary voters engraved questions and send video to its spread among candidates.
None of the questions tabled on the afternoon of Wednesday 28 November were more ridiculous than snow monkey that asked Democrats about the global warming debate in the Republican Party of Youtube.
But the questions, and answers reflected, this time much of the state Republican Party for the elections next year.
No one knows exactly how producers of CNN, which co-patrocinan the debate, chose the videos of Youtube to show the candidates to aspirants.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single issue, focusing on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful clichés for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters that caused the dial listen when agradaran thoughts I notaron: issuers peaks of approval when candidates spoke with arguments extremists.
Exchanges of words strongest night occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the pioneer national, and Mr. Romney, who has been leading in the crucial Iowa polls and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of soft Romney because it was illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts hire illegal immigrants to work at home.
Both responded aggressively when I asked if any candidate could support a "amnesty" (allowing illegal immigrants to regularise their situation and dandoles the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
The minor candidates as Duncan Hunter, a Californian Congressman Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to agree with the issue.
None has the floor to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both blew the whistle on the immigration issue before the others.
At least on immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share views: increased Surveillance at borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of toxic toys from China and other concerns from outside help Republicans to forget, or minimise, divisions between liberals and conservatives Christians.
But the debate was transformed into appeared uncomfortable when other issues.
To Mr. Guiliani asked why had supported the arms control in the past.
JOHN MCCAIN and Mr. Romney debated whether plunging should be viewed in water torture.
Someone asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led to Mr. Giuliani to face towards the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, not believed literally in the history of Jonás and the Whale.
Someone else asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, firstly in the most recent poll of Iowa, thanks to its Christian conservatism longstanding - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to respond if Jesus would be in favour of rió, saying that Jesus was too smart to be candidates for elections.
The race is unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in Iowa, coincidentally with the fundraising campaigns liberal Ron Paul, and their heated statements of the debate on Wednesday.
These two have come from the bottom, because the two Wings of the party were not agree on the candidate most famous and traditional.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate supported the party early and convincingly winning with a message on the greatness of America, meeting on both Wings of the party.
This time, the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
Labour Pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which sink; but equally emerges
As the political scandals are in England, this is not particularly interesting.
Do not seem to have been sold influences, or exhorbitantes accounts of hotels in Paris, chupadas or extramaritales fingers.
But it has revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the party of British Labour government, more than 650, 000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) for about four years using false names, and that the party will not denounced.
Two months ago, when Prime Minister failed to call an election, estúpidamente abused British intelligence declaring that opinion polls not influenced its decision, the hope was that provide a strong and efficient government.
But Instead, as Calbe Vince liberal Democrat, the growing leads with ingenuity, because the dreaded Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, showed the regulatory weakness and poverty trial in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has business groups together against the government.
The tax authorities lost 25 million personal data that revealed a pastiche administrative unimaginable.
A trio of retired generals began a mutiny in the House of Lords, protesting against the cuts in military spending: be ministers of the armed forces is called for, a part-time employment.
Now the multiple donations are David Watt; Peter Abrahams, the secretary-general and Labour Party (previous) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walk irrevocably towards the end.
Governments can reach a turning point after are unable to govern.
People don't believe as politicians, but usually suspend its disbelief when a new batch take control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, not long understates this suspension is more: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are seeking; the bad news press; and the government is on the defensive and not approached.
In part, the position of Brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders cannot defend themselves by arguing that is new.
Though would renege on Tony Blair, was his lieutenant governors.
The Northern Rock problems and registration tax authority, are linked to decisions that Brown did as chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even though is not directly involved in the Blairish setbacks of - or "effective for partners," research funding political parties - voters can assume that if he agrees.
However, the situation of Mr. Brown is not as bad as it sounds.
The gaffes are not as bad as the Tories want show.
As Mr. Bean, nobody has died, nor has been cheated directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is giving what trends of course Mr. Brown Stalinists promised: a government always reliable and brutal.
The new political scandal donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, comparing their donations with gifts of charity, says that he does not want public recognition for your benevolence.
Perhaps so, but the decision does not take him.
Laws against anonymity for the big political contributors is clear and there is a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those who have the power.
Mr. Watt, who said that the agreement with Mr. Abraham, and that it was not illegal, obviously Jon Mendlesohn face, head of fundraising was questioned on donations in October.
But Mr. Brown so far is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these actions, although the bulk of payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the prime minister has made half of work.
Was swift to condemn his party for violating the law, but fades in decisionmaking by a family matter, a committee of inquiry into the matter - driven largely by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been breached, it is a matter for the police.
Moreover, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, and to find a permanent and independent head for the Committee on Standards in Public Life, it has had one six months ago, and it must also push for genuine reform of the financing of parties.
This will require an arduous task Labour's cooperative with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation is with the unions - measures for a bitter partisan as Mr. Brown.
But he must face some facts partisan.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way they can move to victory is to act with an impeccable honesty and sound competition.
Sharks CARDS
The crisis of subprime mortgages is infecting the American market for credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that naden dorsales a fin moved around.
Today that the American market housing is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country's market of credit cards.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimated that losses in credit cards can reach 99 million dollars if the crisis of subprime mortgages or other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection already are.
There is an increase in charges of cards and crime rates, which measures the proportion of the balances that have not been covered or over 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that took 1.4 million charge in its business of financing the American consumer, partly due to the weakness of providers of credit cards.
However, it is too early to panic.
Late payment and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter the crime rate 3.89 % was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The decline in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the bankruptcy law American people (2005) gave rise to a sharp decline in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represents a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore of gloom) would be growing again, or it can happen that conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also brings solid payment rates, showing how their debts consumers pay each month.
And confidence in credit cards and values backed by assets is quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the volumes of emissions by the year 2007 will be nearly 25 % higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection of the crisis between subprime mortgages and market credit cards certainly exists: consumers like load debts to credit cards now lenders caducando are.
But issuers of credit card enjoys the flow of liquid asset values, so that the falling prices accionan not necessarily a change in the ability of borrowers creditor.
They can even work to aventajar broadcasters.
Incentives to consumers continue to have the mortgage falls if properties worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the debt payment card rises in the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond rapidly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering balances creditors.
This in theory should reduce the risk of a retasación rapid assets.
"We are not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all loans," says Gary Perlin finance chief, Capital One.
If a sudden infection in the subprime market credit cards is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If prices are lower houses and a credit crunch drive America into recession, the industry faces a future undoubtedly more severe.
We must remain vigilant dorsales these fins.
British bankers convicted in Enron case
Three British bankers who were on trial for his responsibility in the fraud with the former head of the Enron financial office, Andrew Fastow, offering both were convicted this Wednesday.

Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that required to live in the United States while celebrating the trial.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies, the nation declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could not hide debt of millions or do seem successful their businesses that fail.
The collapse did lose thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion in market value and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling excused his behavior at his trial, the defendants were commissioned last years for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling excused his behavior at his trial is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
The conviction of Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when died of a heart attack last year.

"Botched surgery" could be a cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "slightly more healthy" and saw how an ambulance rose by white Cape Cod, two doors down on Avenue West Scott.
Suddenly, a car of the police patrol.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance," said Mr. Livingston, supervisor of the restaurant that day Wednesday.
"That was when I knew that someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41 years, assistant director of the Department of Newark police.
Now researchers are trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure done by an unauthorised plastic surgeon, which is not yet identified by the police, but working in the home of 212 of the AV. West Scott.
The authorities still do not determine what caused the death of Mrs Arroyo, but expect the toxicological tests although the results will not be available until a few weeks. This will help resolve the mysterious death of sorry to the upper ranks of Newark police.
Mrs Arroyo was assistant director of the police, Garry F. Mccarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was fair, hardworking and determined," says Mr. Mccarthy on Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She protected. "
Mr. Mccarthy said that Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, ex-oficial a Newark police working for the Commission to control alcohol, and which left two children 14 and 11 years, and a hijastra.

Aflojaron is the stock markets in London, New York and across Europe after Kohn Donald number two, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the reserve, declared that EU policymakers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the tension continued financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing signs credit bags, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence "part was reversed by the improvement in the market at the end of September and October."
If persists the upward trend, would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for property and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital markets USA and to make further cuts interest rate, to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped to appease Wall Street amid bad news for the economy of the USA, as sales of homes that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turmoil was punctuated by a warning Bear Stearns, investment bank cut off 650 jobs, equivalent to 4 % of its total workforce in an overall reduction in costs to offset the loss of their investments in sub-prime mortgages USA.
It is expected that only 20 of those jobs come to London, where the bank employs 500 people.

England in the Owais demands of Bopara Ravi Shah and
There are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat the No 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, is Owais Bopara Ravi Shah or?
And none is less important from the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should decide?
The second question is relevant because Graveney David, the president of the selection - is on loan with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desktop Hugh Morris, director of England, is beginning to fill bids to become national selector, and if not, in one part time.
Not achieve the sixth place of beats will be unfortunate, but life often is unjust and sport.
It is not easy to throw what makes a man at the top of their profession, while another was never going beyond the lower level, sometimes lack of luck rather than capacity.
Not only in the cricket the choice is difficult, because they require judgments that always end up being subjective.
Is the time to Bopara that lift?
Is it fair to Shah if him?
The same question could be done in another aspect if John Edwards, says "or" Tubby Banerjee, two bright young executives with good grades and are familiar with the business, would be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level for a cricket player, unless given the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
The figures are naturally a great influence on decisions, but that also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the eye of captain at the same time to take a bateador wicket and get opportunities to change the order if it wants to make an impact as a player one day.
But catch the eye of the seleccionadores is more complicated.
There were many which improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who plays in the first test even if Harmison Stephen pleads for fit and bowls like wind networks.
Anderson took wickets 32 first-class in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both have had its high points and can expect more of them.
Games Shah Bopara or at the Stade de Asgiriya can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make the career of a man, or it can Mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did so well in the first wickets, with 5 and 40 useful careers, but Paul Collingwood was struggling to establish, at the same time who went to become a major player, and despite writing a cent double against Australia in Australia, may yet be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, following a discussion in today's sitting at the Stade de Asgiriya, will their instincts and encourage conservation experience of Shah above exuberance were largely of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah is its bright and valuable test at the beginning of the film's debut 88 in Bombay, 32 first-class hundred face only 6 Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger and has excellent antedecentes against spin off the Bowling.
But Shah made only ten races in their two shifts in May against West Indies in Lords proof in your house as Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectores when Vaughan called Instead for the next meeting, seemed to have taken their batting something élan in Bombay.
On the contrary, the team of Essex has in actual fact concerned with joie de vivre on swords.
This condition is putting it for nothing in the field of cricket and its attitude was summed up when his vehicle involved in an exhibition for the car sponsor of England, Volkswagen.
Suffered minor injuries and, presumably a shock, but the first thing I did was take their Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and Alastair Cook call, your fellow team was looking at a distance, with excitement: "Dresses that?".
Bopara is the best player, including its slope happens to have effects on their satisfacerlo stake to batea, because with confidence and skill.
Choose the right man is one thing, choose the best moment, another.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
My inclination would give Bopara a chance to, that does not Mean that sobresalga Shah not suggest, as the tea leaves, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses transporting refugees back to work, and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees in Syria began to reach Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles that were not effective, without visa extensions and hoped that the city back on its feet.
Some even had returned to combat militants the led outside their homes.
In the season of Mansour buses, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in a convoy of official government consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was Full of refugees from Syria and Jordan had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors killed in Baghdad," said al-Qubaisi Sabah, Sunni doctor.
"I returned today by what I saw in TV and what I read in the newspapers, on what happened in Baghdad and that is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi Army left to kill people," says, referring to the Shiite militia religious of the militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a cessation momentarily.
Qassim Atwani, the Shiite 38 years and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with their two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
Its neighbours Shiites in Amariyah I received a telephone call to say that a force US ally helped bring Al-Qaeda outside their bastion west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers Jordan was the head of a Sunni tribe Shi'a and was led from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad, by an attack of grenades, after urged citizens to stand up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that had begun a militia in Sleikh against Al-Qaeda and that they needed my support and my colleagues."
"I therefore again today," Obeidi Sabaah declared Alu, 62 years.
Many said be swayed by growing calm in the capital since American troops afianzaran groups of "citizens concerned," armed and working in cooperation with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many have been declared by the refusal of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis were established in recent years.
Al-samarrai Salaam, 51 years and father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion among exiles, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, asked the Syrian government impose restrictions on visas of refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe have fled the country for cuadrillas because of the sectarian death.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni.
"I can't believe in a government that supports the criminals who fire my home after that I left."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
The fear is that a sudden wave of refugees will arise again sectarian tensions and start the fight.
The small Saarland, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even is conspicuous by the international orientation of their colleges.
And throughout the country, the sarlandeses lack of educational field.
"Yesterday I explained quincuagésima for a sarlandés not that we are not franseses" - that was the Moto ironic about themselves the tiniest federal state cencuentenario for.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have an important role in the educational system of Saarland that a study by the Institute of the German economy IW (Bildungsmonitor) called " " ranked fifth place.
In this way, the colleges traditionally have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The Universities of Saarbrücken was melted in 1948 by the franseses.
Until now students can finish his university career with two or three dipolmas.
In consequence, the percentage of nickel foreign students is high, 15, 6 by hundreds.
However, the number of students from Saarland above-average is higher in schools, many of them do not have a bacillerato.
"The Saar exploiting the system of vocational education," says Plünnecke Axel experte, the educational sector at the Institute of the German economy IW ().
More than five young makes their equivalents in vocational school, so that the Saar is 7 % above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the possibilities for Education profesional-académica is extensive.
The offer of dual careers in relation to the number of inhabitants, is the second best in Germany.
Despite vocational training and a growing demand, the number of graduates in engineering sciences fell one-third in recent years.
That was why the Ministry of Education of Saarland jolted the colleges to do more to advertise specialities engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA study, carried out some reforms in education schools general," says a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
The government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
For children start soon to study last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr," this has no cost, while this model imitate others also estades federal.
The comparison with the coming studies will show whether has increased students' performance.
According to the report Pisa in 2003, the number of pupils behind in desminuyó school development of 29 to 20 %.
But, in general, the Saar not improved much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, calculating pupils know better.
To the chagrin of sarlandeses the Pisa, the report does not compare knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field could achieve good results.
Despite the sarlandeses are not French, the language of our neighbours is a compulsory subject in the secondary education institutes.
When Chavez changes.
Póximamente in Venezuela huso hours will be another different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez leaves change the timetable in Colombia atrasando The clock half an hour.
Now Chavez is becoming as a comedian in Spain.
As was reported by the Official State Bulletin Venezuelan, according to the new law will, unless four hours GMT.
The Colombia will have a huso timetable does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things Chavez as an enemy of the United States, justifies their desición saying that the United States would impose an obligation to change the world one hour.
Moreover, the local time Wednesday (Chavez) announced the breaking of relations with its neighbour Colombia because of action with hostage-taking.
The left-wing nationalist said that there would be no relation either with the head of state or with the Colombian government until the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chavez, who is propulsando a constitutional reform where the country's citizens to decide on the oil in a referendúm Sunday.
This reform could extend rather their power in the country.
The reason for the conflict desición was taken by Uribe by withdrawing the mandate of Chavez in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in that it was the release of the hostages.
Chavez said Sunday criticising that the decision taken by Uribe offended Venezuela.
In Spain we talk a lot about Chavez.
A new tone of so-called cause feeling in the country: "Why not?" Callas, is the sentence which have already unloaded half a million people.
This phrase gave the king of Spain that was disturbed by ongoing interrupcciones by left-wing populists last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to a forecast this year, cutting wages real threat German employees despite a strong economy.
Experts have a lot of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Böckler Foundation, Hans German employees should count in 2007 with a cuenta-salario real lower than the previous year.
"The fault that is weak evolution of salaries, the increase in value added tax and estirón food prices and energy", reported the newspaper Bild " Gustav Horn of macro-economics Institute for Research and economic cycles.
The new burdens unemployment insurance can apply to employees.
Finance Minister Setinbrück Peter told the Ostanbrücker newspaper Neue Zeitung ' " that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the burden of unemployment insurance 3.3 % from one year to another, it is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office should not interfere in an unacceptable situation, appropriations and asking a federal state subsidies, according to a party's political German Social Democrat.
On Tuesday became public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and oil derivatives reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, these are increasing 3 %.
Venus: twin brother on Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, the planet Venus is more akin to land, something that until now had not been raised. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays into the atmosphere and remolinos in the Poles, the same that appear in winter on Earth.
Since three decades ago researchers had the suspicion that may be in Venus rays.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: discovered electromagnetic waves on the brink of the atmosphere. In cayen rays Venus of heights 54 kilometers and a cloud behind another Cris, Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles in the scientific journal "nature."
According to the famous model the origin of the life of Urey-Miller, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms could have provoked reactions in the ocean, for its part, had led to the amino acids that are the building blocks of life.
In Venus is not the case: if one day had living there, that would be one of the first states of evolution, " explains are Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus cannot be life: air pressure is almost 100 times higher than in the soil and surface temperatures of 500 reigns above 30° C, oscillating so attainable freezing temperatures.
"Possibly, sister Venus is a" diabolical " in the world, but remains a sister, " said Russell.
The main objective of the mission "Venus Express" is the answer to why Venus, so similar to Earth for his size, mass and has had an evolution so different.
And since the 1990s special missions had not only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for research from Venus.
The latest results of investigations that will be presented in many articles "nature", according to researchers show not only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"This also desmuestra planets neighbours have more common characteristics with land which we assumed," reports that.
Despite the stormy winds already known in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the south polar region vórtice also formed by the clouds tour faster.
This phenomenon reminds flows in high wind atmospheric layers land, according to the polar describes a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni Institute's astrofísica Italian special and physical space.
The second planet of the solar system has mass almost equal to the Earth and its diameter 12 kilometres Guinea is almost as great.
This planet called Star of Alba or orbita Evening Star around the sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation is slower: a day when Venus amounts to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus surface temperatures with its 460 degrees and air pressure not 92 bars to Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under the same conditions.
In the two planets had patchwork water on Earth was in the oceans, but disoció is Venus in the universe.
While on earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones in Venus, form the bulk of the atmosphere.

In Tolouse was also burned cars and public buildings.
Kenan Kolat, president of the Turkish community in Germany demanded greater federal government's efforts for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns a copycat effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Despite everything, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years is above average.
We must ensure that more vocational training jobs.
Kolat stressed: "We must provide a perspective to young people."
The president of the Turkish community in Germany added that more than in France "there is a great social control in families" larger French country.
Moreover, most of the young people of foreign origin not to destroy what was built here their parents.
Kolat thinks: "But despite everything, we must be careful."
"We must provide the opportunity for young people to receive faster a job or vocational training."
Meanwhile the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel went peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen participated in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses flew across the territory.
Authorities reported three arrests, as well as heaps and burning cars.
From the day before a team of nearly 1,000 police is handling security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the interior minister, announced that the police will take strong measures until it is necessary.
Monday evening to Tuesday around 80 policemen were wounded by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The unrest continued the next night at Tolouse.
The disturbance began by a traffic accident Sunday, which killed two young.
According to information provided by the prosecutor's office, the death of young people was not because of the police.
In the realm of Angela Wolke.
The action very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its final point and that we should not wait any more.
But in what country living really Chancellor?
After his heartbreaking performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the lower house must say: it does not live in the country should be governed by it.
With regard to reproach him for having devoted repeatedly actions in foreign policy, the chancellor refused a presuntuosa sentence.
He said that would be a way crankiness and note that showed did not want to understand what interests critics.
In the lower house was very clearly expresses all that this accusation was appropriate.
We could not feel the slightest interest, nor any type of feeling for the country's problems.
But Instead, Wolke Angela was presented this way: a policy fleeing very high in foreign policy and stay there without achieving anything concrete.
An example: preventing climate change: much praised itself by the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how these goals here on issues of climate change.
In general, this way of alabarse itself - two years ago the leader of the Demócratocristiana union has not been able to afford such modesty.
Because persists in expressions to reach a boost to the people.
And this way damages their public image for the pragmatic approach to solve the problems without leave for the branches.
But in the realm of Wolke Angela internal problems aparencias are of little value.
What child poverty and worries about the low-wage workers?
Only is dedicated to discuss this issue using subordinate prayers.
It is amazing how often is wrong to talk when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more three attempts to formulate a sentence more or less good.
Begins to face "as if it had been in uncharted territory," when it was more specific information.
Section attacks.
The two front-runners Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney, and made a confrontation in a heated debate Republican Presidential pre-candidate Youtube and must now fear only a candidate from the outside.
Since it was first signs of tension between the candidates.
Mitt Romney observations to his adversary Rudy Giuliani that had turned New York into "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
This, for its part, serious accusations responded: "I would say that his home was a" port " for illegal immigrants. " ex-governador explained to Giuliani Massachustes of saying that he was who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attacks so far: as the group of Republicans has no clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidate exploit the debate on CNN, especially to discredit his adversaries.
The small videos of rodados 30 seconds for Internet usarios who were sent to Youtube, nor have much content.
"With this kind of isolation allowed Hitler come to power," that was the accusation of John Mccain to his adversary Ron Paul, the single insisted on meeting immediately withdraw troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives a lot of criticism by veterans of the war in Vietnam, when refuses to recognise as torture "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, to leave choke on a person simulated his death.
Public reactions in the chamber in St. Petersburg in Florida show that in the meantime the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or debates on torture.
The public always very strong applauded when conservativos who praised values and denying tax increases.
So you can see better where are the weaknesses of both favorites.
"At that time I got it wrong," compungido explains asks Romney and apologise to the people and the public television for having been an advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, they knew what to say when asked what he thought about literal interpretation of the Bible.

The Krautrock founders.
The most famous German band of the 1970s is continuing its activity: three members of Harmonia " " participated in a concert in Berlin.
As reestreno was a copy of "live 1974" which was written in the heyday of the gang.
In those days were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen official to a meal caused the feeling.
Each has in front of cajita much, its cables and above all the buttons.
In the middle sits Moebius Dieter has 63 years and is dressed in a white shirt.
His left is Rother Michael 57 years, which has its portable computer and guitarra.
Right, looking in the audience Hans-Joachim, is Rodelius, 73 years old, is busy with the panel of controls.
Each contributing with their sounds, among them are even pace.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This does not seem to upsets lords.
Something very exciting for the fans Krautrock of was the fact that the Harmonia band to make music.
What we must disclose here is: accurately questions have shown that the name of the retumbaba band in the minds of the people, but it was not something so special after 32 years extrañase the public.
But why Germans cannot also applaud his living legend of the 1970s?
Especially since the Kautrock ambiguity was always more useful in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a prize for music "echo" members of the gang can Cologne 2003 for her work in living room, you could see the faces shocked artists German pop.
And when network agradecía Chili Peppers Hot Band to Neu and the Düsseldorf!, all opened with astonishment.
Michael Rother later spent time on stage during concerts of Chili hot Peppers network as if it had been an old friend (band).
Ignorance in their country and recognition abroad, are one thing.
It is a problem to remind this band, because the trio was only two years and at times not achievement a big effect on the public, however, was subsequently thanks to the other.
Already Moebius some time ago Roedelius had done and music with the artist Schnitzler Conrad and had a name, pretty much, promising fame.
Tocaban initially in the basement of Schaubuehne Berliner.
Later, for economic reasons, worked with a music company Duesseldorf in which was patronizada by a church.
For a time, trabajillo Rother had a Kraftwerk and in guitarrista worked after Neu band! Managed to improve the reputation of this German band in those days was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of cluster in the Forst in exile to Weserbergland.
Alten there in Weserdorf, which is a ruin the 16th century onwards, living like refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological Comune in the Roedelius, where I was complaining about his position.
That was more a life of artist Full of surprises.
According to a day carried a flag of association Harmonia Ottenstein of song in the garbage, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first albúm Musik was called "Harmonia von" and the second " Lux. "
Despite that music was calm and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as the artist was not only for 'know thyself'.
The CD "live 1974" was filmed during a concert Griessem. Someone in recalls that participated in this recording almost 50 people.
Then Rother expressed a desire for Harmonia powered and do from time to time trials.
For Moebius Roedelius and this demand is against the habits.
In 1975 the gang announces its separation.
Rother ended in esoterismo issues and secured its existence by Flammende álbumes as "herzen."
Pretty revived the 1980s and from that time has had more success than Harmonia was.
The recording albúm in direct Griessmer, that we should thank Groenemeyer.
Its music company Grienland was as goal cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as music alive.
And the Roedelius, the Neu band! Was again exposed.
The presentation of Harmonia as gang takes place in the home of the world's cultures in Berlin.
The gang was funded with public measures Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, English, the old punk and the author of the Sampler Krautrock manual '.'
There is also present Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all Krautrock influences the next pop are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a súper-banda, a post which was empty.
The phrase Brian Eno accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only music, partenece she fúturo the."
There are Harmonia where photos with producers in a building.
The history of the development of the legend shown in photos projections in black and white, where are instruments with wires.
In the background are three veterans who came to improvise again.
Do nothing more than setting the body microphones and the battery to produce special tones with the help of equipment effects that was built with their own hands.
Now electronic music is as it should be.
Three people voluntarily technique.
But that does not change anything.
Under the direction of barbaric Morgenstern, in an environment is musical susurra, coughs and in good time emphasis "Aaaaaaaah sings!"
Krautrock already was always a word of English origin.
But it was never rock.
There was the origin of gender, but in blues music schools (CAN), Kraftwerk Technologies (in) or fleeing the artistic and social conventions (pretty).
Who here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia retains the calm.
Under the scenario is very well on what is already clear.
Where begins and ends music?
That can break one the nerves or give rapid moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "the Hunting party" and " Moerderischer " Frieden engaged again to the war in the Balkans.
But the two were not so much conviction.
Or the concepts are set far into action and tirotes or two demasiando films are exciting.
Richard Gere with its "the Hunting party" cannot help in this case.
At the beginning there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, are hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, was found again the actor Richard Gere.
Finally had lost the guapo man is more of the 1980s, because nobody wanted to look after their roles pleasant minor and films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "the Hunting party - when a Hunter becomes what pursues" (why today the titles of films have to be so long and crazy?).
The film has a wonderful presentation to view: basically, your role of reporter in war is the presentation of what could make Richard Gere, if the fate and the film industry had not been so misericordiosos with him, he was a man whose better days of life, which already spent as a monument to the ruin of its decline until now maintained most of its charm.
"The Hunting party", although this victory, along with Moerderischer " Frieden " production is German and will also be presented this week, are just a series of films without success on the war in the Balkans.
You can narrar the film "Moerderischer Frieden" in a nutshell: there are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Topol Adrian Max Riemelt) who want to save a francotiradores of Serbia in Kosovo, one of them is very quickly and that leads to enamore it.
The film is lost through actions and shootings, although we are pleased that the Serbs are not presented again as the only culprits.
The film is as the series "Alarm all German charged 11" without motorway, but in a state of war.
In the case of "the Hunting party" could be investigated, because in reality it was never a good film on the war in the Balkans.
At another time, another director and another author of script (Richard Shepard in two positions), history on American reporters in the war which is going to detect a Serbian war criminal so-called "Fox," probably could be a new " Apocalypse Now. "
Thus, the stories are remarkably similar: the small teams are twice the mountain to accomplish something that cannot make the army and it is becoming a trip on madness.
One reason for the failure of "the Hunting party" is when we start to Simon Hunt, he cannot be simply a cynic with heart.
No, the script also provides an adventure loving Muslim with a Bosnia will kill.
Then "the Hunting party" is far from the truth, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive quickly achieve what could not be achieved during five years NATO, the CIA and all the world's Heads, which was capture war criminal and make musulmanos Bosnians to vengaran.
It is so bad, that want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on logica crimenes against the cinematica.
However, incidentally, the film is, in fact, one profondamente human.
The pelicula wants to condemn the fact that Karadzic and esten Mladic even free and stresses that the Americans and the French estan not really worried tracked down, due to their political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so that one comes to head a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this peoma is a mask of a demon Asia: "In the gandes brow of his brow, sharing the see feelings with him hard, which is being bad."
In films as "the Hunting party" there are also these demons but they show that hard to be good.
The problem is not only in the gender of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper published all films on Iraq are produced in Hollywood fiascos.
You can also add that there has never been a good film on southern Africa.
Almost always is one rule: when a star dabble region in crisis or the minefields, then something like "Rangoon have recently Arguette" with Patricia, " across all borders " with Angelina Jolie or " sangrientes " diamonds with Leonardo Dicaprio.
Perhaps all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They must spend at least decades until ruede a good Hollywood film about the Holocaust taking as an example the film "the list of C275."
Certain films already need more time. As the classic works on the war in Vietnam "the Deer Hunter," " Apocalypse Now " or " Jackett " Full Metal in their times were not concluded unanimously as masterpieces.
Today it might know too much about world conflicts, and so our times each Massenmord massacre (directly) has been tabled in two television at home.
And that is because the authors of script are not the slightest compunction (which is necessary in order to narrar) in good stories.
"To Be or Not to Be" or " the Great Dictator " ultimately proved as good, because Lubitsch Charlie and still not so bad knew that was really the Nazi regime.
Perhaps should not be a good person to break a film.
Perhaps there is to be as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with its distant sarcastic gaze and an artist.
When I asked him about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, responded: " This is only that some things never change their. "
Cities always in danger, men are always going to be murdered cruelly and always will reign in Yugoslavia war.
Von Beust receives as answer negative criticism on the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism of politics and economy by not requesting the Summer Olympic Games.
Many want to continue to fight for competitions in Section watersports.
But Beust recalls the need to be realistic considering the possibilities.
Hans-joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director-general of the Chamber of Commerce Hamburg, said Wednesday this resignation as "not good for the economic base."
In the last time any other project in the big city triggered much motivation as the idea of hosting the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective could not keep the political momentum, sporting the same level."
Schmidt-trenz demanded the Senate do not forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "for another time."
On Wednesday, the Beust mayor Ole von held their ambitions of Hamburg in hosting the Summer Olympics were not carried out until at least the year 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but that is decided by the Federation of German Olympic sports," says Beust von in the Welt online.
The decision sent the federation (Sportbund) Sport expected in early December, on the request to the Munich Olympics 2028 winter.
"This preference means for us in this period, which have hitherto thought until 2028, from the point of view there is no realistic chance."
Despite everything, this dream could not forever, Beust said von.
Sports Federation (HSB Hamburg) regrets the statements of von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg not to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It is too early to take the opportunity, at the moment whether plans are ruined," said the PLO Günter until Wednesday, the director of HSB.
A renunciation of the request is contradictory to the statement by the head of the Senate did at a reception at the general meeting of the Federation of German sport public colleges of the adh ().
Von Beust appointed at the request of Hamburg Universiadas for 2015 not as "a replacement" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of Sport colleges appointed the Hamburg as a candidate of the request.
The fraction German Social Democrat party SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion (the Senate) observations that did not take the time so valuable to build houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was delaying the development of small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympics or build houses", said Veit and Jan Carola Quast, members of the German Social Democrat Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required an integrated planning Olympia for small Grasbrook and then the use of houses built, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, the application of Hamburg for the Olympic Games of 2012 Summer caused great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
There are wooden boxes.
Who likens the terms Sweden and wooden box, believes IKEA, but not in Andy Warhol thinks.
Or has it?
Currently wooden boxes are produced in Sweden as the shadow hanging over the list of Warhol works.
Most of the 1990s and Brillo-Box four "type" of this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper Expressen "push" doubt on the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of 1968 Andy Warhol, of Museet Modern Museum in Stockholm conducted internal investigations and came to conclusions disappointing: six " Brillo-Boxes ", that the Pontus Museum ex-director Hulthén gave Museet the Modern Museum, are false, and almost a cent of others " type Stockholm ", which are in circulation in the international art market, are too.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between the patrocionadas and artistic production.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York its first Brillo-Boxes, " " depiction wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same shows that had cartons of soap powder " luster. "
According to Warhol, in the explanatory their works 1968 Modern Museum Museet were Brillo-cajas exposed hundreds of cardboard. These Warhol did (because of expenditure), but were brought directly from the factory cardboard "luster."
It was not works of art, but copies (which were only a few objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, produce Warhol allowed Brillo-cajas in Sweden a wood, but were not exposed in the Museet Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those days now talk about almost fifteen boxes, at that time came in the history of art and auction as the original "Brillo-Boxes" from " type Stockholm " authorised by Andy Warhol.
At auction some of them were bought by more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that after the famous Pontus Museum director Hulthén made false statements in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed nearly a cent of wooden boxes that Warhol they left him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in year 1990 in Malmö and for Hulthén for exposure in St. Petersburg.
During this time Warhol was dead for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservative Museet Modern Museum, explored Brillo-Boxes six museum property and three private property Swedish were manufactured in 1968 at Stockholm. Imprimieron first platas esmerilaron and their serried and then the painted with the pincel oil because it will do them.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the 1990 shows that the paint was implemented with a steamroller without platas print directly serried. Moreover is not paint the oil because it will do them, but acrílica paint.
"These funds have not been authorised by the artist and must be removed from the Brillo-Boxes official list of Andy Warhol of Lars," says Nittve, the director of the Museet Modern Museum and adds that if the Committee on autentificación Andy Warhol " art " in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Museet clasificará Modern Museum as these six boxes copies / objects of exposure. "
In July, the autentificación committee formally announced that accepts these "serious accusations" that it is boxes of soap powder.
But since that time there all remained silent.
