The business NSA underlines the total absence of debate on the information
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which of one quoted upsets itself in public convoking the ambassador of the United States on October 21st, and of the other one forbidden the browsing of the territory by the Bolivian presidential airplane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence to his edge of Edward Snowden?
According to me, there are two levels of reply on behalf of the French government.
While François Hollande phones Barack Obama or when the Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius convokes the ambassador of the United States, they react to a true discovery, which is that of the extent of the American surveillance on the unity of the communications in France.
It is not amazing of on the one hand reading the reproduction of the diplomatic correspondence American and of other in the columns of the World at some weeks of space part a conviction of the listenings of the Quay of Orsay by the NSA?
Would it not be as a vague hypocrisy of your part
The journalistic move is not a moral positioning, but the research of the interest and of the pertinence of information that allow every citizen to build up an opinion.
While WikiLeaks raises the veil on the analysis by the American diplomacy of political or other stakes in the whole world, we consider indeed that, with regard to the American power, that constitutes an important lighting.
While we describe the American systems of interception contrary to the French diplomacy in the United States, it is not in any case to incense us of this practice, it is to describe the such world that it is.
Has France benefited from information supplied by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aiming our interests?
Can one do without the American collaboration?
The arrangement for roughly ten years of technological tools of interception very powerful by the United States, but also by France, officially has been justified by the fight against the terrorism.
Moreover, in this domain, France and the United States notably have put in place of the procedures of cooperation and of almost daily exchanges of information and that are described of part and of other as main parts.
A Titre D'exemple, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal zones at Miranshah has been signaled to the French thanks to the means of the NSA.
France can be driven, for example, to transmit whole blocks from data on the region of the Sahel to the American services, and, in equivalent - one has already rapidly said it -, the Americans can give information to the French on other regions of the world.
Therefore the question of bottom behind this business NSA is not the capacity or the right of the countries of endowing itself of tools of interception, as well as the question of the total absence of preliminary debate, notably within the Parliaments, on the justification such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, after all, the question of the attacks on the freedoms.
That risk really the United States? a degradation of their picture?
One has beautiful to denounce them, I do not see in what way they will be able to be punished.
The risk run by the Americans can be double.
The first, it is while their allies - and that has been the case lately - learn that their leaders, sometimes to the highest summit of their State, have been watched.
It is the case of Brazil and of Germany, two countries where the diplomatic relationships with the United States are tightened themselves.
Another effect can be it more economic: more and more European or sud-américaines firms balk, in the light of the revelations, at entrusting their confidential data to American recipients subjected to the American laws, and therefore to the hold of the NSA.
Last element: the vast movement of revelations engaged by media of the whole world, which contributes to engage a debate on the practices of surveillance of the services of information until then practically non-existent, could drive to the legislators, including American, to reconsider the powers that they have given to their services of information.
Barack Obama receives the Iraqi Prime Minister, in full outbreak of violence
The American president had to receive Friday 1st November 2013 the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, in pursuit of help of the United States to fight against the strongest wanders of violence for five years.

This violence is more and more murderous in spite of measures of safety reinforced and of military operations of wingspan launched since months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by the chiites.
The total number of dead men persons in October is the most raised since April 2008, when 1 073 people had been killed.
Two years about after the withdrawal of the American troops, the level of the violence made fear a new fire even though the neighboring Syria is in prey to a civil war.
The bombs strike markets, mosques, marriages and obsequies.
Men are destroyed in full street or even by them, and the strengths of safety are also the target of frequent attacks.
The increasing dissatisfaction of the sunnite minority, to the power under Saddam Hussein, who complains about being marginalized politically and about being the target of unfair arrests, has favored this outburst of violence.
Friday, new violence has killed four people in the north of Iraq, at the following day of the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, of which the explosion of five booby-trapped cars to the north of Baghdad.
A domestic left from the violence has been imputed to the Islamic State in Iraq and at the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated to Al-Qaida (sunnites extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is to the center maintenances in the United States of the Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki that will be received Friday by the president Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12th, 2011.
At That Time, the American president, elected on the promise of putting an end to the military commitment in this country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
For his arrival Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the elected representatives of the Conference.
Thursday, he has pleaded so that the international community leads a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of a help increased in Iraq as regards safety is supported by of influential republican and democratic senators.
But the latter also have criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a chiite, attributing him the partial responsibility of the resumption of the violence by his "policy sectarian and authoritarian".
They have also required from Barack Obama that it makes "seriousness" understand in Nouri Al Maliki that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government constitutes a problem in our bilateral relationship".

The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure that one takes a cigarette to smoke.
Only one dose of the vaccine has been able to protect for life mice from the dependence at the nicotine.
Other tests are necessary before beginning the testings on the human being, but the Teacher Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College of New York has declared that the first signs were encouraging.
«We hope really that this kind of vaccinial strategy will be able to help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods today available on the market, but discover that their addiction is sufficiently strong to surmount these different approaches», has declared the Teacher Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information necessary to conceive anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus infects in a selective way the cells of the liver, which begins then to cause a regular flood of antibody.
The antibodies track down all the present molecules of nicotine in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, what prevents the smoker from having his dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice to whom one has given afterwards nicotine have pursued their activity in a normal way.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated «were appeased», have declared the researchers, sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiences are described in the review Science Translational Medicine.
The previous vaccines against the tobacco have proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently so that the levels of antibody remain high that they were too expensive and little practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be pretty inferior because it transforms the cells of the liver into factories at antibody.
The Teacher Crystal has declared that if the future vaccine to human use was completely safe, one could administer it to the children before they are tempted of trying a cigarette, what would prevent every addiction to the nicotine.
But it is more probable that it is used by the smokers who want to stop smoking.
«They will know that if they start to smoking again, they will not take any pleasure because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and that will be able to help them to lose their bad habit», it has added.
British scientists have declared that the results were interesting but they have notified that well more deepened investigations were necessary.

Tripodi denies to be influenced by Obeid
The previous minister labor of News-Wales of the South Joe Tripodi will be the subject to an inquiry of the anti-corruption regulator of the State.
The previous minister of News-Wales of the South Joe Tripodi has denied to have modified the policy of commercial beams at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had interests hidden in three goods situated in the zone controlled by the government.
Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has broadened his inquiry for knowledge if Mr. Obeid had made pressure on several ministers of the State to renew his beams in Circular Quay, where the Obeid possess two restaurants and a coffee after their expiration in August 2005, without it not having been there of call of offers.
She holds an inquiry on the allegations according to which Mr. Tripodi knew of the secret interest of Mr. Obeid in these properties, with reference to the testimony of the previous assistant secretary general of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday henceforth.
In the course of the years of discussions started in 2005, the government has made pressure so that the beams are the subject to a call of offers.
The tenants were against and wanted also longer durations.
In 2009, the beams regarding the firms of Circular Quay, which brought in about 2.5 M$ to the Obeid per annum, have been renewed without it not being there of call of offers.
M. Tripodi, who has been a minister of the Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was favorable to the calls of offers to the departure.
But he has denied to have changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid that, has recognized Mr. Tripodi, asked for a change in the governmental policy as regards beams.
The transcription of telephonic conversations presented to the ICAC has shown calls passed in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a high ranking official who had arrived to the ministry of the Ports after having worked under the orders of M Obeid at the ministry of the Fishings

«Not», has replied Mr. Tripodi.
I do not remember of which we have discussed but in any case, it was not of that.
In any case probably not between me and Mr. Obeid.
FAA: The aerial passengers henceforth can use gizmos aboard the airplanes (but not to pass a call with their portable telephone)
The passengers of the airlines will be able to use their electronic devices from door to door to read, to work, to play at games, to look at films and to listen to music – but not to talk about their portable telephone – in accordance with the new directives very waited for published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But the passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be set up will vary of an airline to the other one, has declared the administrator of the FAA Michael Huerta during a press conference.
The airlines will have to prove the FAA that their airplanes respect the directive news and that they have updated the manuals of training of the members of crew and the rules regarding the tidying of the devices to be in compliance.
The FAA has declared that it had already received plans of some airlines aiming at broadening the use of the electronic devices on their airplanes.
Delta and JetBlue are part of the companies that have already subjected plans.
«According to the plan, we could approve of a broadened use of the electronic devices very soon», has indicated the FAA in a declaration.
Presently, the passengers must switch off their smartphones, bars and other devices as soon as the doors of the airplane are closed.
They are not supposed to relight them before the airplane reaches an altitude of 10 000 feet and that the major gives his green light.
The passengers are supposed to switch off their devices during the descent of the airplane before the landing and not to relight them until the airplane has landed.
In accordance with the directive news, the airlines whose airplanes are correctly protected from the electronic interferences will be able to allow to the passengers to use their devices during the takeoffs, the landings and the rotation to the ground, has declared the FAA.
Most of the new airliners and of the other airplanes that have been modified so that the passengers can use the Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should satisfy the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the of Association Professional Flight Attendants, has told to itself happy with these changes.
«A time the new implementation policy in every safety – and we are going to work in narrow collaboration with the carriers for that it will be beneficial to everybody», has explained Glading in a declaration.
We are frankly tired of feeling ourselves as «supervisors of room» while it is a matter of this question.
But it will be always banned connecting oneself to Internet to surf, exchanging emails and SMS or loading data below 10 000 feet, he has declared the agency.
The passengers will have to put their smartphones, bars and other devices in airplane fashion.
Therefore always not of Words With Friends, the online game style Scrabble that the actor Alec Baldwin played at on his smartphone in 2011 while it has been expelled to great noise of an airplane of American Airlines after having refused to switch off his device even though the device was parked to the door.
And the devices heavier than the laptop computers will always have to be ordered because they could hurt somebody if they flew across the cabin.
The portable telephones aboard will keep on also being forbidden.
The statutory power regarding the portable telephones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
The FAA can raise the ban on some electronic devices during the takeoff and the landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National one Transportation Safety Board, national expert in safety of the transports on CBS News, has declared that the portable telephones always were considered as presenting a risk.
«The portable telephones are truly a problem, not only because could they possibly create interferences with the instruments of navigation, but because we know, of after the FCC, who they could disrupt the antennae-intermediary of mobile telephony if they are used aboard,» has declared Rosenker.
An industrial advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the problem has recommended the last month that the government authorizes a broader use of the personal electronic devices
The pressure weighing on the FAA has been reinforced in the course of the last years to loosen the restrictions regarding their use.
Of the detractors such as the sénatrice Claire McCaskill, D-Mb., maintain that there is not any reason of valid safety for these bans.
The restrictions are also more and more difficult to apply because the use of the devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of the passengers forget to switch off their devices or make it deliberately.
The FAA has started limiting the use of the electronic devices in 1996 with reference to the relations on the presence of interferences with the instruments of navigation and of communication while the passengers transported radios FM, the high-tech gizmo of then.
The new airliners depend much more on the electric systems than the previous generations of airplanes, but they are also conceived to resist the electronic interferences and approved by the FAA.
The airlines allow their passengers to use the Wi-Fi at the altitudes of cruise for several years.
Had modified them to receive systems Wi-Fi resist also better to the interferences.
The vast majority of airliners should allow a broader use of the electronic devices in accordance with the directive news, has declared Huerta.
The electronic devices of today produce in general transmissions radio of power well weaker than the previous generations of devices
The readers of electronic books, for example, express only minimal transmissions while one turns a page.
But the transmissions are stronger while the devices load or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those that make of the electronic devices pressure for a softening of the restrictions regarding the use by the passengers.
In 2011, the leaders of the society have loaded an airliner of readers with electronic books Kindle and have made it to fly to see if there were problems, but there has not been any.
That has inspired the members of the advisory committee of the FAA feelings mitigated as for the question of knowing if the use of the devices presents or not a risk.
Douglas Kidd de la National Association of Airline Passengers has declared that he thought that the interferences coming from the devices were real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee have declared that there are only anecdotal relations emanating of pilots who indicate that the devices can interfere with the systems of an airplane, and that most of them are very old.
Though, the committee has recommended that the FAA allows to the pilots to ask the passengers to switch off their devices during the landings to the instruments in conditions of weak visibility.
A group of the industry of the journey has congratulated of the changes, calling them of the arrangements full of common sense for travellers equipped with technologies.
«We are happy that the FAA admits that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with the safety», has declared Roger Dow, President and manager of the U. S. Travel Association.
The rules relative to the use of electronic devices aboard remain for the moment in Australia in force
The Australian aerial passengers will have to continue switch off their bars and their smartphones during the takeoff and the landing in spite of the gesture of the United States aiming at loosening the rules relative to the electronic devices
The American Federal Aviation Administration has left the porte ouverte to the American carriers for a change in their procedures so that the passengers can read electronic books, look at videos or play at games on their devices during the critical stages of flight provided that they are in fashion «airplane».
The passengers can make it already during the greatest part of the flight but numerous people find hard of not being able to reach their electronic books during the takeoff and the landing.
The Australian carriers examine the decision that obliges the American carriers to carry out an important work with a view to respecting the particularities, but they have indicated that they do not have the intention in the immediate one of changing their procedures.
The Civilian Air Force Safety Authority also has declared that she examined the announcement but has underlined that the restrictions carrying electronic devices on the use during the critical stages of flight were always in Australia in force.
«PUT up it does not have specific rules governing the use of the electronic devices by airplane», it has declared.
The question is the subject to some rules that oblige the farmers of aircraft to guarantee the maintenance of the safety permanently and the passengers to respect the orders of safety given by the members of crew.
Virgin, which already has spoken to the PUT of his intention of stretching the use of his system of diversion aboard using the technology Wi-Fi, was open to a change, but has declared that it would follow the regulator.
«We would receive favorably a review of PUT it that would allow the use of the electronic devices because we think that that would improve the customer experience maintaining that we leave (of the system of diversion aboard using the technology Wi-Fi) on our airplanes really», has indicated a spokesperson.
Qantas has declared that it respected the present rules for the time being.
«In accordance with our present policy the electronic devices can not be used during the takeoff and the landing, and we do not have the intention in the immediate one of changing that», it has declared.
The decision of the FAA applies to the American airlines.
Though, we are always interested by the statutory evolutions that could benefit the passengers, and we will examine close up the decision of the FAA and the reasons of this.
For the American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary of an airline to the other one and will depend on the age of their fleet.
The carriers will have to demonstrate that their airplanes can tolerate interferences radio coming from electronic devices as to revise the manuals, the material of training programs them of transport of handluggages and the orders supplied to the passengers.
«As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of his fleet, it can allow the passengers to use light portable electronic devices «as bars, readers of electronic books and smartphones at all the altitudes», has declared the FAA.
In the rare cases of weak visibility, the crew will ask the passengers to switch off their devices during the landing.
The group also has recommended that the heavier devices are ordered in every safety under the seats or in the superior compartments during the takeoff and the landing.
The CDC publishes advice on the allergies by the child bound for the schools
Wednesday, the American Center of control and of prevention of the illnesses has published a series of directives indicating how to manage the food allergies of the children at the school.
It is a matter of the first series of guiding lines that the American government publishes, since the number of children in school age suffering from food allergies has strongly climbed.
A child on 20 in the United States suffers today from a food allergy.
The CDC has discovered that the prevalence of the food allergies by the child had increased in 18 % between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information destined for the schools on the way of sensitizing the professorial body and the staff to the food allergies at the child, and on the way of treating them in the event of allergic reaction.
It commends itself also to the schools of having a stock of épinéphrine – the self-injector of brand EpiPen being the most ordinarily used – to be able to react rapidly in the event of potentially mortal anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of the States have lately updated the regulations to allow at the schools having more easily épinéphrine in stock.
The relation includes also a list of the typical symptoms communicated by the children who have an allergic reaction.
The children can say, «I have the impression that something stings me the language me have the impression to have a hair on the language or«me have of the tinglings on the language
A lot of opposition to the medical aid to die to the Conference of the palliative care
The Canadian Conference of palliative care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, occurs some days after the vote in favor of the principle of the bill on the medical aid to die in Quebec.
It is the occasion for several associations of palliative care of reaffirming their disagreement.
If all the patients had accesses to efficient care to appease their sufferings, on top of being able to remain at home, very little out of them would want to put an end to their days, according to a spokesperson of the Canadian Association of the palliative care, Maryse Bouvette.
If one put the accent on the palliative care at Canada, the approach of the euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Network of the palliative care of Quebec also rejects the bill at the medical aid to die.
If it is adopted, Alberte Déry worries about the consequences on the next generations.
"What is the sense of the life", she laments.
The majority of houses of palliative care will refuse to help the patients to die, according to the vice-president of the Alliance of the houses of palliative care, Suzanne Fitzback.
Mme Fitzback, also manager of the house Mathieu-Froment-Savoie at Gatineau, considers that the service would be anyway useless.
One never asks for us: "I want to die, give an injection to me".
The manager of the Association of the palliative care of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the bill of Quebec disorientates the population about the vocation of the palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will fit together the step.
From his side, the liberal deputy of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, maintains that the notion of end of life will have to be clarified before the bill is adopted.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
While I was small, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candies, to go to go to bed late and to disguise ourselves to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I have become stingier.
These two last years, I have not distributed only one candy and I will probably not make it more this year.
But the stats show that I am the scabious ewe while one talks about Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million out of them in fact – célèbreront Halloween this year, spending a total of 6.9 Md$ in candies, disguises and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.

The disguises should represent 1.2 Md$ on the 6,9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the inanimate sexy objects are all the rage.
The women do not need to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
With regard to the men, I expect to see numerous zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of the space of Daft Punk will depict Instagram among our photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after disguises are the zombies, Batman, the pirates and the witches.
I suppose that there is not harm to remain traditional.
We have disguised our dogs last year and, to my great amazement, they were not the only ones.
Actually, the Americans are going to spend 330 M$ in disguises for animals this year, according to the NRF.
That makes many curious dogs disguised in hotdogs.
While it is a matter of candies, one does not loaf.
The Americans are going to spend 1.9 Md$ in candies this year, according to the office Nielsen.
That represents about 272 million kg of bars Hershey, lollies, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and bars Clark.
It is a super news for the 41 million children that goes to the hunting to the candies in their neighborhood, according to the American department of the Business.
Actually, we are going to buy and, we do not tell histories to consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
The corn candies are the only thing which one does not want to eat; and nevertheless nearly 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That represents 9 billion grains of corn about.
It is not a mystery that I have not yet managed to clarify.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the haunted houses are.
They carry the best names,» as «Terror Behind the Walls» (that is in fact a true prison),« Howl-O-Scream»and« The House «of Shock».
Actually, there are 1 200 haunted houses recognized officially by the United States, which generate 500 M$ of receipts about, according to the America Haunts, and that includes these tremendous photos of you at pouring you top that your friends put on Facebook and off which you can not take and on which a type that you love leaves a comment of the style «pretty head».
Finally, talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown has presented The Big Pumpkin to us when one was kids, and to sculpt a pumpkin in the form of lantern, it is as decorating a Christmas tree – it is something that one worries since one is very small.
Fortunately for us, the «tendency of the baby-pumpkin» has not begun that the last year thanks to Pinterest, therefore most of us have sculpted these potirons and has not had to sit inside.
This year, the Americans will spend about 106 M$ in pumpkins, according to the U. S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkins-lanterns that withered sweetly on the porch of your house probably came from the Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins have been cultivated this year.
If you try to make yourself to notice more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon to Napa, in California, and try to sculpt their pumpkin of 922 kg.

"That has not stopped for this morning, the fightings continue in spite of the night", has indicated to the AFP an inhabitant of Jomba, joined by telephone to 12h30, and according to whom a fillette has been hurt by ball in the morning.
"The intensity of the confrontations has reduced a little", it has added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the RDC have rejected a little the rebels".
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" to Jomba before going up to the forehead for an "operation of raking".
One heard very clearly behind it sizzlings fed from light weapons.
Of Bunagana, political fief and last fortified town of the rebellion fallen Wednesday, a journalist of the AFP could hear detonations of heavy weapons.
According to a source to the Mission of the United Nations for the stabilization of the RDC, the fightings have entered "to a final stage", the FARDC having "encircled the positions of the M23 residual to evict them".
From the resumption, Friday, of the confrontations between the Movement of the 23 Mars (M23) and the army, the Monusco does not participate directly in the fightings, but it provides for the governmental troops a support determining as regards information, of observation and of planning.
In end of afternoon, several tens of soldiers, well supplied with ammunitions, went up towards the line head-on.
They were armed with kalachnikov and with rocket launcher.
A bit earlier, on the road leading at Bunagana, post-border with Uganda, helped servicemen of civilians loaded a numerous rocket launcher gone up on a truck flaming nine with the FARDC, having to assure the relief of another machine pounding the positions of the M23 on the hills.
The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, has called Wednesday night a new time the rebels "to demobilize itself voluntarily" on pain of being disarmed "by force", but he has left opened the process of Kampala, where Kinshasa and the M23 discuss since December without result for the moment.
On site, the political leaders of the M23 hope to get to an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it does not remain anymore that to the Ugandan mediation to organize" "the signature", has asserted Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the delegation of the M23, without this information being able to be confirmed immediately of the governmental side.
The M23 has been born of a mutiny, in April 2012, of previous rebels, mainly tutsi, integrates into the army in 2009 after an agreement of peace.
The UN and Kinshasa accuse regularly Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, what Kigali and Kampala refute.
The Nord-Kivu is one of the regions the ones more densely filled with the RDC, and his basement abounds in mining resources lusted after.
To Bunagana, of the Ugandan side of the border where about 5000 people had sheltered between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the movement back to the RDC who was engaged itself at the morning is inverted itself to the mid-day.
"This morning we have recrossed to go to our fields, but the servicemen have told to us to withdraw", has indicated to the AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded with his nine children, of which an infant piggyback.
One has the impression that the gunshots approach the populations.

The anxiety related to the safety in Mozambique grows at the same time as conflicts burst among powerful personalities
To the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, preside over founder of Mozambique, at eying them, thousands of people have gathered in the center of Maputo to scan pacific slogans during a rare public demonstration
«We want» the peace «to come back; we want of the stability », has declared Vanessa of Sousa, general manager of an investment company.
Worries for the future of his country, she has exchanged his clothes of work for a T-shirt carrying the mention «we want the safety» in Portuguese before joining treads it built up on the place of the Independence of the capital Thursday.
For two weeks, virtually every day of the relations stating conflicts between the governmental strengths and the Renamo, the worst collisions from the agreement of peace that was signed more than 20 years ago, has been.
The Renamo was in the past a famous rebellious movement, supported to the departure by the Rhodésie governed by whites then the government of apartheid of South Africa within the framework of the efforts to destabilize the government independent from the country.
After an agreement of peace signed in 1992, it has become a party of opposition.
The analysts think that the country should not fall in a conflict open, but the recent events have shaken the foreign investors and the local population.
The stake is sizeable for the economics in full growth since the discovery of enormous reserves of offshore gas and of deposits of coal in the north-west could attract more than 50 Md$ of investments in the course of the next years coming from societies as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brésil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko des États-Unis.
The Frelimo, the party to the power and the main political strength for 1975, and the Renamo throw back mutually the responsibility of the tensions.
The Renamo declares that the government is at the origin of the recent confrontations and that it has launched an attack on his members to the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of the Renamo, on October 17th.
The assaults on the previous rebels have then degenerated while the governmental strengths have attacked the bases of the Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesperson of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes the Renamo responsible for having started the conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
The president Armando Guebuza has tried to minimize the anxieties regarding the instability.
M. Guebuza has declared Wednesday to the AFP, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself as a «loser» that wanted to use« all the strengths that it remained it to try to prove that it could impose his decisions to the government».
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist to say that they wish for all two to avoid the war.
But the anxiety has grown after Mr. Mazanga has declared that the Renamo abandoned the agreement of peace of 1992.
He has declared to the FT that it meant that the agreement was not anymore respected by the Frelimo.
«We want to recover the negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness», has indicated Mr. Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parts have not succeeded in appeasing the tensions fed by a series of conflicts this year.
«It is not two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) that do not stop quarreling», has explained Joseph Hanlon, one speaker of the open university and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them knows to negotiate well and none of them is ready to make the concessions necessary.
The Renamo, who is in favor of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycott the local elections in front of taking place in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are foreseen next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of the strength as the attempt of an ill movement of obtaining concessions and a treasure of war on behalf of the government.
The part of the votes gathered by the Renamo does not stop lowering for 1992, while a new party, the democratic Movement of the Mozambique (MDM) that was created by a previous member of the Renamo, should obtain a greater number from votes to the elections.
M. Mazanga has said that Mr. Guebuza – that should retire at the end of his second mandate next year – wanted to destroy the democracy in the country.
«It does not want of a multipartite democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want the peace because he does not want to leave the presidency», has declared Mr. Mazanga.
One does not know exactly what is the capacity of the Renamo, but it has led attacks lightning troublemakers on the police stations of police and the vehicles on a freeway axis major north-south.
Most of the collisions have taken place in the province of Sofala, which is situated at several hundred kilometers to the north of Maputo, but where Beira, the port from where the mining societies notably Rio Tinto and Vale, export the coal, is.
In June, Rio no more has been able to use the railroad during about a week after the Renamo has threatened to attack the railroad line.
M. Mazanga was fakely shy while one has asked to him if the Renamo réitèrerait this threat.
The Renamo wanted «to warn the international community of the things not being fine in Mozambique», has indicated Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has reinforced the frustrations that the government arouses, declares Fernando Lima, manager of Mediacoop, an independent society of media, of numerous people being also worried by the corruption, the slowness of the development and the recent wave of kidnappings
«The people think that the persons in charge of the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is last to it to take on solutions to the problems», it has explained.
Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, has said that the people wanted only stability.
«Nobody cares about the Renamo or about the Frelimo, they want just to find the peace, they want to have a free access to the roads», it has added.

He has summer signaled to the court that the newspaper has loaded Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, of pirating the vocal box of Pawlby and of «dumping permanently in front of his door», but Coulson also has called it and has left messages to him vocal.
«The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is henceforth the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to remain people in front of the house hoping to discover them, it is the kind of man to love to present the history to the people to see what they say», has declared Mr. Edis.
He has declared that NotW used three means to hold an inquiry on the subjects: the telephonic piracy, the surveillance and the confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is evident that he knows of the second, the surveillance, it can not be otherwise.
But what it is of the first?
To-you him knowledge of the telephonic piracy?
He asserts the opposite, but we say «Of course that if».
The rumors on a link implying Clarke have been recovered in first by the office of the writing staff of NotW while a source, feeling a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, has declared that one had told to him Do not lose your time with it it is with Charles. »
A gang, on which were recorded of the vocal messages pirated on his telephone to at least three resumptions, has been seized to the domicile of Mulcaire in August 2006.
The investigators have also found seizures on the computer of the private investigator that concerned Miss Pawlby and his sister ordered in a file «projects».
For the period where the detective has held an inquiry on it the grandparents of Miss Pawlby have received anonymous calls where one asked them for information on it has added Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, the previous reporter in leader Neville Thurlbeck and the previous reporter James Weatherup have supervised the surveillance of the lesser facts and gestures of Miss Pawlby.
In a vocal message that it has left to him on June 18th, 2005, Coulson said: I have a history that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would love to talk really to Charles about. »
M. Edis has explained that the involvement of Coulson in the history has followed the same diagram as with other men important, such as the previous minister of the Inside David Blunkett.
The jury has heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about a link with a woman married then that himself frequented the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at this time.
Coulson and Brooks deny to have conspired with others to pirate telephones between October 3rd, 2000 and August 9th, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to have carried out of the telephonic piracy.
Plan of rescue of 325 M$ destined for the system of health of Tasmania
The federal government maintains that the plan of rescue of 325 M$ destined for the system of health staggering is accompanied with strict conditions aiming at guaranteeing that the government of the State will not waste the funds.
The federal minister of the Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth takes presently of the «urgent measures» to put an end to a crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the insular state, the high rate of chronic illnesses and the pressures of the system.
The financing, foreseen towards 4 years, has been decided after consultations of the government with the deputy independent from Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
«The government has proposed a plan of rescue of urgency that, according to us, unique règlera the difficulties» that «the State» is «confronted» with, has declared Mme Plibersek today.
The plan of 325 M$ includes a campaign of 31 M$ for the not urgent surgical operations.
2 600 additional operations, notably in the domain of the orthopedic surgery and of the cataract, will help to recover the delay.
Funds are also foreseen for the clinics without appointment at Hobart and Launceston, of better external care, the training of the medical frames of the services dedicated to the mental health and the deployment of systems of electronic medical files in the local hospitals.
«These investments reply to the idea according to which, according to the clinicians of first line, it is a matter of the best means of looking after the system of health of Tasmania», has declared Mme Plibersek.
The minister has maintained that the government of Tasmania would be confronted with a strict system of preparation of the relations and of surrender of accounts.
The State will have to maintain the present levels of financing in order to receive money of the Commonwealth and to prepare monthly relations on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A commission composed of three people will be constituted to guarantee that the State supplies the services with the possible most efficient and efficient way.
M. Wilkie has said today «about a real reform allowing strengthening the system of public health of Tasmania» that the 325 M$ will not count for much «unless they are steady».
Nevertheless he has congratulated the government to have replied at the request of urgent help that it has presented to the Prime Minister beginning May.
«I hope that the federal plan of help will contribute greatly to withdraw the system from public health of Tasmania of the blacklist», has declared Mr. Wilkie.
According to the government of the State, these additional not urgent procedures will invert the recent cups in great part.
But the spokesperson of the opposition as regards health Peter Dutton thinks that the announcement of today is one «a solution of fortune».
«The reason why we are here is that the government labor of the State has withdrawn 430 M$ of his system from health», it has declared on ABC TV.
One can not have a government of the State that extracts nearly a half-billion of dollars and the Commonwealth that puts 300 M$, and to claim that it is a day splendor.
M. Dutton has visited to Mme Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar of the plan of rescue will be spent in additional bureaucracy.

Dr Georges Bwelle dispenses free care of health in the villages of Cameroon
Dr Bwelle and his team spend nearly all their weekends to see hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this country of western Africa, hardly 1 for 5 000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 Heroes CNN of the year 2013.
You can vote for it or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect it «Héros CNN of the year».
This person will receive 250 000 $ to pursue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle has watched his ill father alternate the periods of conscience and of unconsciousness and to go to hospitals that were not equipped to come it helps some.
Jamef Bwelle has been hurt in a car accident in 1981 close to Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
Initially, it has had only a broken arm, but it has contracted an infection that has spread up to his brain, creating a hematoma of which it was going to carry the after-effects the rest of his life.
«There were not neurosurgeons in Cameroon», he has declared Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken it abroad if we had had enough money
Instead of that, Dr Bwelle has spent years to accompany his father to clinics and hospitals filled, so that it obtains any treatment that he could benefit from.
«It is not easy», adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 hr, to dash to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
People can long die because they wait too much.
The situation has much not changed the father of Dr Bwelle in 2002 from the death.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor for 5 000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As comparison, the ratio in the United States is d'1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, numerous Cameroonians could not pay the consultation.
Two people on five in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the expenses of health of the country are realized in the private sector.
«The only problem that they have, it is the poverty», has explained Dr Bwelle.
And because of the poverty, they can not take advantage of the life.
After having seen his father and as much of his compatriots to suffer, Dr Bwelle was urged to try to change the lesson from the things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of voluntary have practised more than 700 surgical acts for free in the course of the last year.
He has become doctor itself working as vascular surgeon to the central hospital of Yaounde.
And it has created a humanitarian association to not lucrative goal, ASCOVIME, that makes itself rural in the zones for the weekends to dispense free care of health.
For 2008, it and his group of voluntary have helped close to 32 000 people.
Nearly every Friday, with thirty people, they are piled in vans after having set the medical material on the roof and cross difficult grounds to go to the villages that need the more help.
The luck does always not follow them.
They have many times owed to move the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But while they happen, they are received in hero: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best available accommodations.
In these villages, the free care of health is a good reason of making the party, and Dr Bwelle – with his great smile and his bursting energy – is more than happy to be joined with the festivities.
The day after morning, the team starts receiving hundreds of patients.
«We receive 500 people to every visit», has declared Mr. Bwelle.
They live sometimes at 60 km of the village, and they come on foot.
In this itinerant, diverse hospital care of health is given.
Numerous people receive a treatment against the malaria, the tuberculosis, the malnutrition, the diabetes, the parasites and the sexually transmissible illnesses.
Others can receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – document necessary to go to the school, but numerous poor families can not quite simply not to allow to itself to buy it.
The night, the team practises simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
The operations are in general practised in a school, a town hall or a house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to leave the next person his place
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the material, Dr Bwelle and her voluntary work until the first hours of the Sunday morning.
It is a rhythm tiring out, but the musicians of the villages help in general the team to remain justified.
«They knock on drums all night to keep ourselves bright so that we can continue work, has explained Mr. Bwelle.
On the Sunday, the team returns downtown, tired but proud of the work that she has fulfilled.
The group, compound of Cameroonian doctors and of students in medicine, has practised 700 surgical acts for free in the course of the last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those at whom they come in aid.
A man has explained that the free operation that it had undergone to look after a hernia would allow him to work again.
«That is going to change my future and that of my family», has declared the man.
In more of making to live this itinerant hospital and of working as surgeon to the hospital, Dr Bwelle also works the night in medical office deprived around Yaounde.
It is this second job it explains, who finances his association to 60 %; the rest is covered by private gifts.
«I do not know when he sleeps», has declared Katie O'Malley, a student in medicine in second year of the university Drexel to Philadelphie and voluntary within the group of Dr Bwelle.
It is always in the hospital or at trying to take on money for his association in order to be able to lead these campaigns
For the students in medicine and the nurse students as Katie O'Malley, who come of the United States and of Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it is not an occasion of apprenticeship on the ground that they do not have at their places.
«One has been able to participate in operations to help Bwelle to absorb the blood or to make the instruments to the Dr pass», has explained Miss O'Malley.
It is not something that you have the occasion of making in America while you are étudiant in medicine in second year.
The voluntary students pay in general their journey up to Cameroon, and arrive often with collected medical material.
But a time in Yaounde, their pension, their transport and the education are taken in charge by the doctor Bwelle.
«He is a hero, there is not doubt», has declared Katie O'Malley.
It gives his life for this association, and his desire of helping the Cameroonian people is not close to dying away.
For Dr Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
To help the others to live happy holding his father the promise that it has made is something that brings him an immense joy.
«I am so happy when I do this work», has added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope that he sees what I make.
To make the people laugh and to relieve the pain is the reasons that drive me to make that.

The two France of Pierre Nora
Perplexed, the academics have long toiled to define and to situate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in the amphitheaters and the rooms of lesson
No doubt, but underlining her weak for the paths of strut, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrate works of others in his office of the street Gaston-Gallimard?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the armchair that Fontenelle to the French Academy occupied?
Indeed still, but knowing that such a curses would not know to replace the real holy oil, that of the thesis, which he has managed without.
Gladly they have recognized in it a great éveilleur, animator and federative of their works, but making to observe that it appeared little prone to produce some itself
In this uncertain image the monument of the "places of memory" has also contributed, which it has attached his name to.
The spiteful languages have been able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a lively glance and ballasted with erudition, but incurably dilettante.
The two works published by Nora these are is you are soon two years have already established that the one that went by not to write had a lot and well written.
The book that these are is you are should give him back definitively justice
One finds nevertheless, a time more, the temptation of the ubiquity, the intellectual wandering, the jubilation put to jump as to joined feet of a subject to the other one.
But one understands in a fast way that the mixed objects gathered in this book to the so beautiful title bring back the second-hand goods dealer to an only and same passion: that of discovering the knot constituent of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls singly national?
Identity: it is a worry of time.
These are is you are little, collectively we have been urged to give a definition.
But in the peremptory mind of our leaders of then, the French identity was a timeless gasoline
It was needed only to deploy the accidents, and the business Jacobinism obliges, the prefects and the sub-prefects, authorized interpreters, was entrusted.
The one that Pierre Nora tracks down is very other.
It does not land in heir of an eternal Frenchness, the definition rejects it
Analyst worried at a familiar strangeness, it wanders in a forest of symbols, order to every step by an object in the form of rebus, tortured of irritating questions.
Of which this, who is born of the firm itself why, in a country so lastingly installed in his borders so anciently carpentered and solidly built, one hears these dramatic calls singly?
They are not so urgent, suggests Pierre Nora, only to beseech the confusion born of the discords of the French history
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the strengths of division, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic is evidently the one that cracks in two the national history
As from the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, the one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second has wanted the death of the first, but without managing to deny it; concerned contrary to finding the sacralité and all the more eager for unity and for indivisibility that it had cut the head to the one that was the evident and powerful incarnation.
And, of there, an invincibly binary nation, shared between left and right, secularity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of the French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagon, so well that the American trip of Pierre Nora well could be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have one and the other one made a revolution, written a declaration of the rights, wanted to found a new society
But the American cousinhood made better only underline what is us own.
Over there, men who had left their Ancien Régime in England and did not have anymore to care about it.
Here, men burdened with a native Ancien Régime, and all the more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here it has sown the drama and the conserved one.
There of the always honored founder fathers, and here of the revolutionary ancestors of whom one toils to make models, and that are itself of the rest killed.
There an institutional constancy, and here a waterfall of constitutions, as as many mistakes to recover and testings to recover.
The France that goes away, the France that comes
Nevertheless a time where the French have believed ago being able to sew up the torn dress of their history again, and defeating the curse of the number two.
To this III Republic, central and creative moment, Pierre Nora has shown a lot of interest and even of tenderness: greeting those that have then applied themselves to making up for the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolboys all what in the old France prepared the modern France darkly and proposing them a unified version of their history
But this pacified identity has had only a time
The these are is you are again discusses it, jostled by an immigration of a new type, threatened by the ascent of revendicatives minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book offers therefore at the same time the portrait fascinating from France who goes away and the circumspect sketch of the France that comes.
With, in bonus, the portrait of the historian, that should reserve some surprises.
One discovers that the vagrant was a homebody.
The man of the numerous curiosities turned around a same idea, lightly obsessional.
The prowler of edges stood at the center of the center.
And the one that had testified, these are is you are more than one demi-siècle, a subject on the idea of nation, but had shirked the initiatory exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, dirtied cum grano, which it will have ended up being it
Indeed under a form less stiff, more burst and subtler.
But we do not deceive, tout aussi constraining.
Because well more that the taxable face of the academic program, this thesis says the interior necessity of a life.
How is the biometry going to invade our lives
Finished the passwords to hit to reach his smartphone or to pay his purchases?
The American, French or Japanese researchers foretell us a future that we will be recognized by the biometrical sensors of the telephones and of the computers.
Bernard Didier, assistant chief executive officer of Morpho, considers even that "the century will be biometrical".
Only the biometry will allow checking on the identity of a person realizing transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as Internet.
The organizations dedicated to the protection of the private life confirm this infatuation for the biometry, but they worry about it.
Nothing that in 2011 and in France, the national Commission of the computing and of the freedoms has authorized 774 systems of gratitude of the imprints, of the form of the hand or of the venous network of the hand in firms of the administrations, of the canteens...
"Everybody soon will be able to be identified, anyplace and anytime," moves itself Justin Brookman, person in charge of the life deprived of the consumers within the CDT (Center heart Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons of one such optimism, by ones, and pessimism, among the others?
The biometry is going to be based itself on new techniques, which will allow giving back the citizens and the consumers new services.
Today, in France, the most used biometrical data are the fingerprints, the outline of the hand and the venous network of loses it or of the fingers.
But each of these techniques possesses his pressures.
"For example, some people who work the concrete have the very damaged fingers and their imprints are unreadable", notices Philippe Robin, technical manager of the identitaire domain by Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as the verification of the venous network and of the outline of the hand require a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is not at the same time a safety - one can not win these data at their insu - and a drawback: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and takes therefore time.
Consequence, investigations are led from twenty years on other approaches, as the gratitude of the face or of the iris (the part colored of the eye).
Thanks to the increase of the precision of the sensors and of the capacity of calculation of the computers necessary for the analysis of the data, these techniques become operational.
The precision of the facial gratitude has been multiplied by ten in the course of the five last years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, manager of the laboratories of R&D d'Accenture in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Holland have deployed of the automatic posts-borders using the facial gratitude.
Identifying a face or an iris on the move is henceforth possible.
"Today, we take investigations on the gratitude of the voice or in the way of walking with the aid of sensors sounds, but a silent environment is needed", indicates Sridhar Iyengar, manager of the research on the safety in the Intel Labs.
Unique and infalsifiable marker, the ADN arouses also hopes and anxieties.
"In the present state of the knowledge it can be considered as the ultimate biometrical datum", confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, manager of the studies, of the innovation and of the futurology at the CNIL.
But the analysis of the ADN is still very long and very expensive.
NEC proposes to the police departments judicial a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze samples of ADN on the place of a crime and in an hour.
The uses of the biometry are divided up in two groups: the identification (to recognize a person among others) and the authentification (to check that the person is the one that she claims to be).
The identification concerned until now the release of papers of identity: the put biometrical elements (imprints, photo, iris) with the information that the State already possesses on all the citizens must be confronted.
That allows checking that a person does not try to usurp the identity of somebody else.
This principle of comparison can have other applications.
NEC proposes thus the gratitude of VIP at the entry of a hotel or of a store.
"We recover the pictures of the cameras of surveillance and compare them with the photos of the celebrities that circulate freely on Internet", explains Dany Nassif, responsible, by NEC France, of the commercial development for the solutions of biometrical identification.
Other use: taking a picture of a fellow who queues in a store, following his progress thanks to the facial gratitude and calculating the time of waiting.
The authentification concerned to the departure the physical accesses (borders protected places, canteens...) or logics (opening of a computer).
Has added to it, more lately, the control of presence.
"A biometrical checker avoids the phenomenon of the friend who clocks in for another", justifies Cyrille Bataller, d'Accenture.
But more and more, the authentification is going to concern also the transactions, in particular those realized from devices connected to Internet.
In Japan, depriving some distributors of money introducing his card and putting his hand on a biometrical reader is already possible: this gesture replaces the touch of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested at Villeneuve-d'Ascq and at Angoulême by the society Natural Security in partnership with banks and signs of the great distribution: at the moment of paying in store with his bank card, the customer does not type his code, but he introduces his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experimentation is foreseen to last six months.
If it is conclusive, the biometrical readers could soon happen by the French storekeepers.
Of the tracks to reassure the users
There are three manners of making the biometry seductive at the eyes of the general public.
The first is of explaining that it can make to win time
"If, thanks to the biometry, a customer remains thirty seconds less in crate desk, it is appreciable", explains the manager of a hypermarket.
The second is of offering personalized services: in some years, a vocal waiter will be able to recognize your voice and propose you options sur mesure.
And, finally, reassuring putting forward the precautions taken to protect the data bases.
"The fingerprints are stocked on a first waiter the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encoded and is stocked in a highly secured case, which is blocked if one tries to move it enumerates Philippe Robin, of Thales.
But, for want of deepened studies, knowing if these speeches convince really the users is impossible.
The specialists in the protection of the private life, them, continue worry.
"The progress of the facial gratitude, the multiplication of the cameras of surveillance and the enormous quantity of available photos on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, makes me fear the worst: a generalized surveillance", foretold Andrew Patrick, of the Police Station to the protection of the life deprived in Canada.
Frontier Airlines plans to make the handluggages pay
Frontier Airlines plans to make to pay up to 100 $ to the passengers who transport handluggages on his flights
Frontier Airlines plans to start making to pay up to 100 $ for a handluggage and 2 $ for a coffee or a soda, although in his announcement Wednesday, it indicated that the passengers could take the can not opened with them to the descent of the airplane.
The new expenses of handluggages concern the bags ordered in the superior compartment, therefore the small bags installed under the seat will be always free.
Frontier has declared that it would make 25 $ pay if the expenses were paid in advance and 100 $ if the travellers paid only a time to the door of boarding.
The spokesperson of Frontier, Kate O'Malley has indicated that the 100 $ were foreseen to incite the travellers to pay the expenses in advance.
«We do not want to make this price pay», it has explained.
The airlines have started making to pay the first and second luggages recorded in 2008.
The passengers who tried to avoid these expenses put as many things that they could in the orderly handluggages in the superior compartments, thus there was not often anymore place in these compartments.
These expenses are a means of checking that the passengers transport less things aboard.
O'Malley has declared that these new expenses will really not be used to collect money
It is a matter of making to understand to the customers of Frontier most faithful that it becomes more and more difficult to take on place in the superior compartments.
The passengers who buy their ticket on the site of the airline will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a door of boarding Frontier could transport a bag for free, while the next person in the tail could have to pay 100 $ for a similar bag.
O'Malley has explained that the site and the procedures of recording of Frontier are changing to guarantee that the passengers know the existence of these expenses before arriving to the door.
The expenses of handluggages of Frontier will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set.
The passengers grumble often about the expenses of luggages and other expenses, but the airlines adore them.
They consider that the costs of handling of the luggages are important and that the passengers who want this service should pay it.
Good a number of people in Wall Street consider the addition of expenses of luggages as a sign that proves that the airlines make enough pay expensive to cover the cost with the journey aerial after years of losses.
Nevertheless a good number of them have not affected the expenses of luggages.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first expenses of handluggages three years ago, and the company low-cost Allegiant has followed a bit later.
The only other company imposing such expenses is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, has declared the consultant next to airlines Jay Sorensen, who follows close up the expenses in supplement.
He has considered, in a relation of December 2011, that the expenses of handluggages of Spirit brought in 50 M$ per annum.
Sorensen, a previous frame of Midwest Airlines, lately has traveled on Spirit and has wondered what it was going to take on to the door of boarding at the moment where the passengers would discover the expenses of unusual handluggages imposed by the company.
«Never I had seen a procedure of so fluid boarding of all my career», it declared.
I expected to see gratings of teeth and a fight burst at the door.
The airplane was full, it has added, «the passengers have gone up aboard to the speed lightning».
Frontier made also as Spirit and wall lamp of the expenses of 2 $ for a coffee a tea, a soda or a juice of fruit.
Frontier has indicated that the passengers who take a soda or a juice of fruit can take the can not opened with them, and those that take coffee can resservis for free.
She will distribute always water for free.
WAYS Airways briefly has tried to make to pay for the drinks in 2008 but has come back backward seven months later after the passengers have complained and even though no other great airline had followed.
The decision of Frontier of making expenses of handluggages pay while the passengers do not buy directly their ticket next to the airline constitutes his last effort to incite the customers to go on his site.
The airlines pay to the online salesmen of journeys as Orbitz 10 $ at 25 $ for every sold ticket
That has incited all the airlines to encourage an agency of online journey to the passengers to buy directly next to them instead of appealing.
Though, Frontier has gone further in this domain.
In September, it has started offering only half of miles of faithfulness to the customers who bought their ticket via an agency of online journey.
Wednesday, it has reduced the bonuses of miles of 25 % on a journey.
Thus, a journey Frontier de1 000 miles bought next to an agency of online journey would allow of earning 250 miles.
It allows also the passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly their ticket on the site of Frontier.
Frontier has some faithful customers in his city of origin, Denver, but his activity moves back and it loses money
The receipts have fallen of 9 % and his capacity of flight has dropped nearly by 13 % in the course of the first term, according to the financial results published Wednesday by his mother society Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to right the finances of Frontier selling the airline.
Scientists have just highlighted the way in which the movements of the tail of a dog are related to his mood.
Previous studies had revealed that the happy dogs moved their tail to the right (of the viewpoint of the dog) more, while the nervous dogs moved it more to the left.
But henceforth the scientists say that the dogs can detect these subtle differences and reply to it.
The Teacher Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientifique of the university of Thirty, has declared: «Everybody knows that, at the man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved in a different way in the stimuli that awaken positive emotions or negatives. »
Here, we have tried to see what it was at other species.
It has added that as at the man, among the dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in the emotions.
To know more on the way whose dogs react to the disordered movements of tail of other dogs, the researchers have followed animals at looking at films where depicted other dogs.
They have measured the cardiac frequency of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will not be needed surely long before we understand why their tail goes sometimes of a side and sometimes of the other one.
The Teacher Vallortigara has explained: «We have presented to dogs films where depicted other dogs – or a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid every other factor of confusion – and we have been able to trade the movement of the tail and to present it as going more on the left or on the right. »
While the animals have seen a dog without expression move the tail to the right (of the viewpoint of the dog that moves the tail), they have remained perfectly relaxed.
But while they have spotted a tail to deviate principally to the left (still a time of the viewpoint of the dog that moves the tail), their cardiac frequency has quickened and they seemed anxious.
The Teacher Vallortigara has said that he did not think that the dogs communicated deliberately among them thanks to these movements.
He thinks rather than the dogs know by experience the movements of which they would owe or should not worry.
It has added: «If you meet other dogs on several occasions and if you notice that, most of the time the movement of their tail to a side is associated with a friendlier attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience. »
The researchers indicate that the results could allow the owners, the veterinarians and the tamers to understand better the emotions of their animals.
The expert in canine behavior John Bradshaw, teacher invited the School of the veterinary sciences of the university of Bristol, has clarified that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and of the right by the canine species.
Last year, a team of the university of Lincoln has discovered that the dogs turned the head to the left while they concerned a dog aggressive and to the right while it was a matter of a cheerful dog.
And in another scientific study realized by the university of Victoria in Canada, it has declared: «The dogs went more easily to a robot dog while his tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of anxious evolution – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study. »
It has indicated that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs having participated in the different studies did entirely not consider the animals of the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on the way whose dogs react opposite true dogs could be useful, it has explained.
«Although numerous elements, raised among different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used at different ends, a good number of details still must be clarified – and the dogs do not make exception», it has declared.
Though, being given the easiness with which their behaviors can be recorded it will not be needed surely long before we understand why their tail moves sometimes of a side and sometimes of the other one.
Launching of a store of accessories for Google Glass
An electronic shop, proposing numerous accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been put at the disposal of the thousand developers possessing a prototype of the connected glasses signed Google.
They can thus acquire an earpiece, a loader or well still a case of tidying.
This store, strictly reserved to the developers already having Google Glass, proposes some accessories such as a loader and his cable USB, for 50 $.
For the same price acquiring a cover of protection produced in micro-fibres or an intra-auriculaire earpiece is also possible.
Although Google works presently on a model of Google Glass equipped with glasses of correction, no date of commercialization on a large scale has been confirmed yet.
Living unity in French, the challenge of the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys
On commission schoolchild Marguerite-Bourgeoys, 62% of the students have a mother tongue other than the French.
It is what motivated, a year ago a consultation next to the parents students, teachers and members of the staff of the education, to think about the means of better integrating the students who live at horse between several cultures.
The school commission has just unveiled his vision of the "To live unity in French ".
The Vision organism diversity is passed itself for a year in the schools to help the students of all origins to discover common marks that do not confine themselves to the French language
The discovery of areas, our architecture, our places are marks.
Great names of writers, of artists, that they are of stock or that moreover they have come.
Who are our builders?
"Therefore, one creates projects in order to what they identify themselves with all that ", explains the president of Vision diversity, Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institute of the New World, has identified several challenges for the school commission
"On the transmission, for example, of what is the Quebecois culture, the feeling of membership, the support to the staff in the transformations that one lives, within the student customers," does he enumerate.
The school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys has created a center of research that will give the teachers tools that, them also sometimes, come moreover.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific manager.
The preparation to manage a class in an American, Quebecois context.
"Of the different pedagogic strategies, it is that the real need", it summarizes.
The investigations will deal with the inclusion under all his corners: linguistic, scolaire, social and cultural.
Obama puts an end to the listenings aiming at the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama has given order to the national Agency of safety (NSA) of putting an end to the listenings that it practised on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank within the framework of his activities of information, indicates an American person in charge, Thursday.
This decision is part of the attempt of the white House of recovering the hand in the business of the listenings of the NSA after the revelations made by the previous analyst Edward Snowden, refugee in Russia.
It is the first time that is mentioned the surveillance of the IMF and of the World Bank through the agency of information from the beginning of the scandal.
Questioned about the subject, a person in charge of the American administration has replied: "the United States do not take electronic surveillance aiming at the seats of the World Bank and of the IMF to Washington".
Expressing himself under the seal of the anonymity, this person in charge has not clarified if such a surveillance had been set up by the past.
Another official has, it advisable that Barack Obama had given order to cease these practices in the course of the past weeks.
This instruction has been given more or less to the same moment that that putting an end to the listenings of the headquarters of the Onu in New York.
In this context, the senatorial Commission of the information has approved of Thursday a reinforcement of the controls on the governmental programs of surveillance but has authorized their pursuit.
The commission has instituted new restrictions on the data that the agencies of information are allowed to collect and has imposed a limit of five years for the conservation of these information.
The European Stock-Exchanges on the decline to the mid-session, except London
Except for London, the main European Stock-Exchanges evolve on the decline Friday to mid-session, weighted by some news of disappointing societies while Wall-Street is waited for on the rise.
Besides, the investors remain careful because they consider that the American federal Reserve could unravel his policy of quantitative softening earlier than be predicted.
Conversely, after the announcement of an inflation to 0,7% for the unity of the euro zone, the idea spreads among the actors of the market that the European Central Bank (BCE) could loosen his monetary policy
Those future of Wall Street let predict an opening of the American actions on the rise, after two consecutive sessions of fold.
To the values, Renault (-4,63%) records the strongest fold of the CAC 40, weighted by the warning on result of his partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6,26%) marks the worst performance of l'EuroFirst300, after having also published results on the decline this morning and announced the creation in boarder of a structure of défaisance ("bad bank") gathering 38 billion books of active the riskiest.
Of his side, Vodafone (+2,45%) maintains in mind the rises of l'EuroFirst300 in reaction to an information of press wanting that AT & T studies a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, the speculations on the evolution of the monetary policy of the BCE go good train as John Hardy, strategist by Saxo Bank, testifies some.
The unique mandate of the BCE has always dealt with the inflation, therefore Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons of acting during the meeting of the next week.
We anticipate one loudly potential of fall of the euro.
In this context, the euro pursues his fold against the American currency and has touched bottom in session one more from two weeks to 1.3517 dollar.
These even conjectures support conversely the bond market of the euro zone.
This sentence means that an adopted bill in July in this State and largely questioning the right to the abortion is going to be able to come into force.
From the classical singing for adolescents
To every time, it is the school customers that will be targeted, an initiative that had known a lot of success in the course of the previous season.
Through five playlets imagined and interpreted by artists of the region, of the labels comprising a strong dose of humor, one allows to adolescents to tame the classical singing
Beside this show, the Society of lyric art of the Kingdom will come back with his lyric Destinations, a formula that makes henceforth packed room to the Pulperie of Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place at the summer 2014, what gives the luck to artists from the region of showing of whom they are capable.
To these activities has added the lyric Apéro, the concert-profit kept in August last, with the competition of the colorature soprano Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a matter of an activity-profit, parallel with the artistic dimension, and it has helped the organism to no purpose lucrative to cause a financial assessment that is as sweet to the ears as an air of The bat.
Without delivering of precise numbers, the president of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, has taken advantage of the meeting of press kept yesterday, to Chicoutimi, to appear comforting.
In spite of the precariousness that is the share of so many cultural institutions, the future stands out well, even in the long term.
We have more solid and constant supports.
"The finances are afloat and we hope to last until the 50th birthday of the operetta, a stage that we will overcome in seven years," has commented the administrator.
"I would say same au-delà", has added the general manager, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The Congolese army pursues the rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) has announced Thursday that his unity was going to pursue the rebels of the M23 up to in their bases situated in the forests and the mountains of the bordering Nord-Kivu of Rwanda and of Uganda.
The M23 appears on the point of being beaten after having been hunted of the localities of the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC) that he controlled from the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.
"We are going to pursue the M23 and drive back it partout où he hides because it is a matter of criminals", has declared to Reuters the colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesperson of the FARDC.
We must not let them be reorganized because they martyr the Congolese people for too long.
The time is come of bringing back the peace.
Persons in charge of the M23 have explained to have evacuated the localities under the diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political person in charge of the rebellion, has maintained on RFI that these military backs would not modify his claims to the talks of peace in anything.
The latter, according to the Ugandan mediators, have recovered Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Collisions are signaled in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last locality to the hands of the insurgents to have fallen this week, as to the surroundings of Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of the M23 has seen on the day in 2012.
To their apogee in November, the insurgents have occupied Goma, administrative center of the province of the Nord-Kivu, taking advantage of the escape of the governmental garrison and of the passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma has taken the Mission of the United Nations in RDC, the most important at the world in term of staff, to reinforce his mandate and to form a fast squad of intervention composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
From his side, the staff of the FARDC has been revised and the army is past to the offensive against the M23, making the lesson of the war change.
The rhythm of progress of the governmental troops is today unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end" foretold an expert of the Congolese businesses Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historical - it would be the first time that the government of Kinshasa succeeds in beating a major insurrection.
And it would not be so the first time for 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda was present in the east of the RDC.
Experts of the United Nations accuse the Rwanda, which denies it shyly, of supporting militarily the M23, appointed of previous mutinous Congolese servicemen to the departure.
The leader of the British diplomacy, William Hague, has invited the Rwandese president Paul Kagame to show, has announced a spokesperson of the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had evoked the possibility of military retaliations subsequent to the shells fallen in Rwandese territory.
Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana have invaded the streets of the town to greet the entry of the soldiers of the FARDC.
"We have lived a year with the M23 and it seemed to us unimaginable to be a day freed by the army", testifies an inhabitant of this bordering locality of Uganda.
"We have lived in the terror (of the M23), we are traumatized, has added this man.
John Kerry has admitted that the American espionage «had gone too much far from inappropriate way», made unprecedented
John Kerry has indicated a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States in relation to his programs of surveillance admitting, made unprecedented, that to several occasions the espionage «had gone too much far from inappropriate way».
The Secretary of State has also admitted that it had, all as Barack Obama, governed on «automatic pilot» while a series of incendiary revelations of the denouncer Edward Snowden about the activities of espionage of the NSA has seen on the day.
The escapes have put the American government to the center of a diplomatic storm with his allies.
Expressing oneself during an intergovernmental conference in London by video link Mr. Kerry has declared: «It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have read about some things in automatic pilot way because we had the possibility, from the Second world war and until the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course on September 11th. »
It has become afterwards the first member of high row of the government of the United States to admit that the American espionage had gone too far, but he has stressed the fact that the rights of each had not been violated.
It has declared: «In some cases, it has gone too much far from inappropriate way. »
And the President is resolved to try to clarify oneself and to clarify clearly to the people that it conducted now a thorough re-examination of these practices so that nobody feels deceived.
I assure you that the innocent people will not be victims of abuse within the framework of this process.
M. Kerry has stressed though, the fact that the NSA was an acting strength for the well and that his operations of surveillance had saved numerous lives.
It has added: «We live in a new world where the people are loans to be made jump. »
There is a radical extremism in the world that it is urged to try to kill people, to make them explode and to attack the governments.
And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
Well and truly we have prevented airplanes from falling, of the buildings of exploding and people of being murdered because we have been able to read about the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, the American legislators will go in Europe to reply to the worries regarding the business of presumed American espionage and to persuade the Europeans of the necessity to hound the linked efforts with fight against the terrorism with the United States, has explained Thursday the president of the subcommittee of the Senate on the European businesses
The senator Chris Murphy du Connecticut has indicated that he had expressed itself in front of the members of the European Parliament and of others this week and that it was worried at the threats that they had uttered regarding a possible withdrawal of the anti-terrorist organizations because of the feeling of frustration that the surveillance of the National Security Agency arouses.
«It is really important for the protection of the national safety in the United States that the Europeans stay to our sides in the mutual commitment in the fight against the terrorism», has declared of the European businesses of the American Senate, during a maintenance from Washington, Murphy, a democrat serving his first mandate, and president of the subcommittee.
And I am going to go in Europe for well their to make to understand that we must continue work together to fight against the terrorism, in spite of the anger caused by the programs of the NSA.
The press reports that the NSA has won millions of communications in Europe, what has put to harm the relationships with some allies of the United States, however the manager of the agency has declared this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a matter of a misunderstanding because that concerned metadatas that the allies of the NATO had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations have stated documents divulged by Snowden according to which the NSA had intercepted data and communications emanating of the portable telephone of the German chancellor's wife Angela Merkel and of those of 34 other heads of state.
The manager of the services of information, James Clapper, has justified the espionage of the allies indicating that it was necessary and that it was a matter of an ordinary practice of the two sides.
In this atmosphere of uproar, Murphy has indicated that his office organized a journey of the Conference, which should take place this year, and that he expected from the two parties and from the two bedrooms that the delegation would include members
The names of the other participant legislators should be unveiled in the days to come.
It has indicated that the route remained to define.
Murphy has declared that the goal of this journey was of allowing improving the relationships, but also showing «affectionate firmness».
It has explained that the European heads of state had to be honest with their citizens about the type of programs of espionage that they apply themselves for years.
«We can modify our programs of surveillance in order to better protect the rights from the Europeans, but also they must understand that we are not the only ones in the world to make espionage», has declared Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry has planned to give back itself this weekend to the Middle East and in Poland to manage the resentment generated by the American strategies in Syria, in Egypt and in Iran, as by the activities of surveillance of the United States.
The call of Scott Brown thrown back
Scott Brown, the captain of the Celtic Glasgow, has seen his call thrown back and well will be suspended for the two neighbors face of League of the champions of his club, against the Ajax and the AC Milan.
Expelled against the Barça to have addressed a blow to Neymar, the Scottish environment has seen his suspension spread to three meetings by the UEFA.
In a communiqué, his club has told to itself "very disappointed", considering that his call was entirely justifying.
For the PDG of Titan, "the project of purchase of Goodyear Amiens starts up with zero employee"
After having thrown the sponge with crash in January for the partial resumption of the site Goodyear of Amiens-North promised to the closing, Maurice Taylor, the PDG of the American pneumaticien Titan, declares itself today, ready to save 333 jobs on the 1 137 that counts the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, minister of the productive recovery, had already announced it Monday, October 21st.
After having renounced the project of purchase of the factory in January, you come back today.
You had uttered violent attacks and insults, talking about "so-called workers", that "work three hours" by day, of unions "madmen", aiming at the CGT.
One does not understand this volte-face.
It is to please in M. Montebourg?
I do not try of pleasing to nobody.
Reserving the right my woman.
M. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to rescue manufacturers from the jobs among the better paid ones.
If I have hurt somebody by my words, I am distressed.
But France has a high level of tax and of unemployment also.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries one works eight hours handicaps France.
In India, in China and in lots of other countries, one works ten to twelve hours a day.
But I do not have prejudices on France.
What I see, it is a factory that produces good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well situated and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with a correct price and competent workers, that it is the blow worth to try.
What type do you wait for agreed between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, from the announcement of the closing of the factory, Goodyear had offered the wage earners a good compensation of departure, I think that 100% of the employees would have accepted it
Now, imagine that Titan buys the closed factory to Goodyear.
Ever since, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to every other country of the European Union that has still his own currency.
I think that Mr. Montebourg knows that.
Yet, he wants to keep the factory of Amiens with at least 333 well paid jobs
Titan accepts to recruit them among the about 1 200 present wage earners of Goodyear.
Also Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment of Titan before trying to lead the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first stage is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on the compensations of departure for all the employees.
Ever since, employees will not be anymore in the factory.
M. Montebourg has said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it
The only one numbers that I have mentioned to the minister, it is 333.
I know that he would want a guarantee of four years.
But as I have told it to you, the CGT and Goodyear must start first agreed on compensations of departure.
If all the wage earners accept them, the project of purchase of the factory starts up with zero employee.
How can we give guarantees of duration of job when it does not remain employees anymore on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg gets to what the CGT and Goodyear start agreed and that Titan buys the factory, we have well the intention of remaining years in Amiens-Nord more than four.
The airport of Los Angeles evacuated after a shooting
A shooting has taken place at the international airport of Los Angeles.
It was local 10h00 of the hour morning when a man has opened the fire

The travellers and the staff have dashed to the exits or on the tarmac.

The High Court validates the law of reform of the system of health of Obama
Great victory for the administration Obama: the American High Court has declared today that the law of reform of the system of health ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 vote against 4, the judges have validated the individual mandate of the Protection Patient and Affordable Care Act (law on the protection of the patients and the reasonable care) – that requires that the citizens take out a health assurance of here 2014, on pain of having to pay a fine – and have declared that it was constitutional in accordance with the power of taxation of the government.
The president of the High Court, John Roberts, has joined the four most liberal members of the Court while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy have expressed their disagreement.
The Court has also validated the other sections of the law of 2 700 pages and has, besides, considered that the arrangement of the law of reform of the system of health, which stipulates that Medicaid needs to lower the threshold of eligibility on pain of losing all the federal financings of the program, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure aiming at blocking the law has been started by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the great republican candidates for the presidential election in lists in the course of the primary ones of 2012, including the candidate named Mitt Romney, are themselves shyly opposite to the law.
Aretha Franklin will rise on stage in December
The newspaper Detroit News reports that the queen of the soul one will happen on December 21st to the room Sound Board of the hotel MotorCity Casino.
Mme Franklin bustles about in November to the recording of an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produces by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without clarifying the illness that she suffered from, the famous interpreter of Respect had asserted to the media on October 16th that the side effects of a treatment that it received were "difficult".
She maintains to be "happy to be back".
The myths and legends would have to be taught to the children as «models of way of life», he declares the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that «the brutal strength does not make the weight in view of the subtle trick», while the arthuriennes legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that numerous myths would be «well too violent, well too scandalous and in some cases, well too obscene to be taught to the school», Crossley-Holland has advocated »one« selection «meticulous» of the works adapted to the age.
«I find tremendous that in America, the myths and the folklore are already part of the education», it has said.
I plead in favor of this project for 20 years.
It has added that the fact that the authors and the teachers are «openly didactic» fact that the children« unhook completely», the messages being« sublimés »in pleasant histories
Crossley-Holland, which has translated Beowulf from the anglo-saxon and has written The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, has declared: «You have maybe good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight »
Maybe that the great difference between an adult author writing for the adults and an adult author writing for the children is the necessity of offering hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or to finish well, but there is one sense innate of the well and of the harm.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a history rather than be declared.
The well known base of it that one shows and that one does not say.
Green light of the United States to the fusion Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom have said Friday not to have received any objection on behalf of the American authorities to their fusion, approaching thus the creation of the first world publicity agency.
The fusion approaches indeed the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe have announced today the expiration of the deadline of examination of the fusion previously announced of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, foreseen by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, such that amended", announce the two groups in a communiqué.
They clarify that they have also received the necessary authorizations at Canada, in India and in Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiration of the deadline of predicted examination by the HSR in the United States and the decisions of authorization issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the réalisationde the operation.
"The fusion also is conditioned to the obtainment of other statutory authorizations and to the approval of the shareholders of the two groups", they add.
New request of collective resort against the brothers Sainte-Croix
A new request of collective resort has been put down against the brothers Sainte-Croix, regarding of the agressions sexual that would have taken place this time to the oratory Saint-Joseph as in several orphanages, schools and schools.
The petition bases on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J"., who would have been masturbated in the years 1950, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher the brother Soumis, then by his confessor, the father Bernard, to the oratory Saint-Joseph, where he was a server of mass and where his father worked as painter.
The first resort aimed only at three establishments, and when one has announced the regulations, many people have told to us: "me, I was to such a place, I can register myself"?, tells the lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in the two resorts.
The collective resort that has just been put down has as particularity to allow the addition of plaintiffs of any establishment where of the abuses have can to be perpetrated by members of the congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At the Present Time, the resort gathers the complaints of 25 people who maintain to have been attacked by the brothers Sainte-Croix.
The alleged facts are in general older that those mentioned in the first resort, since several of the establishments aimed at have closed their doors in the years 1960.
The resort underlines besides that the congregation of Sainte-Croix and the oratory Saint-Joseph, which is a distinct entity, "have let sexual abuses be perpetrated contrary to children", that they "have exercised a moral, religious and psychological pressure on the victims", that "they knew of the perpetrated sexual abuses and nevertheless have suffocated them", and that they have "knowingly and consciously selected of ignoring the problems".
These last accusations are based among others on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers Sainte-Croix, Me Émile Perrin, in the years 1990, but also by the investigations made in the archives by the brother Wilson Kennedy, a previous brother of Sainte-Croix who has denounced the abuses publicly, on that subject.
The collective resort first must pass the stage of the admissibility in superior Court
Once the admissibility admitted by the Court one conducts the second stage, or the hearings on the bottom.
In the case of the first resort, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had accepted to settle amicably before hearings are taken on the bottom.
RDC: the army prepares a new assault
Children act on a carbonized armored one who belonged to the rebels of the M23, at Kibumba, on October 31st, 2013, in the East of the RDC.
The Congolese army got ready Friday for a new assault against the last bastions of the rebels of the M23 close to Bunagana, in the East of the RDC.
The objective is of evicting the M23 of the hills that overhang Bunagana.
Yesterday, we have taken the hill of Bugina, which overhangs that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall of itself
It will remain only the hill of Runyonyi.
"That of Chanzu is not very strategic", has indicated has the AFP the governor of the Nord-Kivu, Julien Paluku.
M. Paluku plans to surrender Saturday has Bunagana.
Political fief and last fortified town of the rebellion, this locality is situated to the Ugandan border at about 80 km to the north of Goma.
It has been recovered Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Wednesday.
For some hundreds of irreducible of the M23, are cut at nearly 2,000 meters from altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close relations of Bunagana and of the locality neighboring of Jomba
At Jomba, an inhabitant who had stated very close fightings Thursday for the whole day has indicated that the situation was "quiet for this morning".
According to it a woman and his child have been killed by the fightings of the eve and have been buried.
A fillette has been hurt by ball and three other people have been hurt, of which one seriously, evacuated by the FARDC, has added this witness quoted by the AFP.
From the resumption of the fightings between FARDC and rebels on October 25th, the two combatants have not given any assessment of the losses in human lives.
The court blocks a decision relative to the policy of control and of search of the NYPD
A federal court of appeal has blocked Thursday the decision of one judge requiring changes in the program of control and of search from the department of police of New York and has removed it from the file.
The court of appeal of the United States (second circuit) has indicated that the decision of judges it Shira Scheindlin was suspended up to at the end of the call lodged by the city.
Judges it had given a verdict in August that the city had violated the Constitution with reference to the implementation of his program aiming at controlling and questioning the citizens.
The city has called on of his conclusions and of his corrective prescriptions, notably a decision aiming at attributing a controller to help the department of police to modify his policy and the program of training that is associated it
The court of appeal has heard Tuesday the arguments dealing with the request of suspension.
The court of appeal has declared that judges it owed to be removed from the file because she has infringed the code of behavior of the judges compromising the necessity for a judge of avoiding every appearance of bias, in part because of a series of granted maintenances to the media and of public declarations in which it reacted publicly to the criticisms of the court
Judges it had given a verdict that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people targeting wrongly black men and Hispanic origin within the framework of their program of control and of search.
It has referred to an exterior controller to supervise the modifications, notably the reform of the policies training and of the supervision, and she has organized the arrangement of a pilot program to test cameras carried on the body in the areas where take place greatest a number of controls.
In August, the city of New York has accepted to put an end to the practice consisting in preserving the names and addresses of the people whose case is thrown back after a control of police.
The hearing of the call lodged by the city should take place after March 14th, 2014.
The tactics of the control and of the search have been criticized by numerous defenders of the civil rights.
This system of control and of search exists for decades under some form but the number of recorded controls has increased in spectacular way under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach his highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that concerned black men and Hispanic origin principally.
A judicial action has been introduced in 2004 by four men, everyone coming from minorities, and has transformed in action collective.
The partisans advocating changes in the program of control and of search of the NYPD say that they will put an end to the unfair practices, will allow having strengths of police more efficient and to which one makes trust, and will be able to change the way in which the departments of police wear away policy
The opponents say about the police that these changes would drain the morale without making the crime lower, would represent a wasting of money and would not solve the broader problem of strengths of police under pressure after the staff of policemen have strongly been reduced in the course of the last decade.
Judges it has underlined that she did not take end to the practices of control and of search, which are constitutional, but that it reformed the way whose NYPD made of his controls use.
The revelations of the NSA increase the paranoia of the firms with regard to the surveillance of State
By a beautiful day of thin August, a helicopter of the German police has flown at low altitude over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On order of the federal Office of protection of the Constitution (BfV), the national agency of information German, his mission was of photographing the roof of the American outpost, situated except 5 km of the European Central Bank and of the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV expected from listening to identify the presence of antennae and that the operation has aroused an exchange between the United States and the German ministry of the foreign Businesses in Berlin.
James Clapper, the manager of the American services of information, has stressed again in September the fact that the United States do not use their capacities as regards foreign information «to steal the industrial secrets of the foreign firms for the account of American societies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits».
But for that Edward Snowden, the consultant become denouncer, has started unveiling his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of the surveillance of the United States, the European governments and the leaders of firms do not know more if the manager must be believed on word.
Of the relations according to which the American National Security Agency has spied the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has had access to data held by American purveyors of services of stocking in the Cloud, notably Google and Yahoo, more than never have aroused the paranoia of the firms with regard to the surveillance of State.
The revelation according to which the telephone of the German chancellor's wife Angela Merkel had been pirated, maybe even for a decade, has been the drop that has made the vase overflow.
If the most powerful person of Europe can be aimed at, then the leaders of firm are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between the American services of information and the firms
I consider that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
«Germany must wake up», declares Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents the German SME of the sector of the TI.
The German societies think that the United States represent a risk as important as China while it is a matter of industrial espionage and of flight of data, according to an inquiry published in July by the office of advice EY.
However in all the documents unveiled by Mr. Snowden, nothing indicates at this day that the United States have transmitted industrial secrets from foreign firms to American societies
The politicians have made part of their anxiety to the idea that the EU does not have computer capacities and Internet sufficient and think that she should endeavor to reduce his dependence in relation to the United States.
The leaders of firm are sceptical on that subject.
A deputy of the German parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close the eyes and reopen them slowly...
«It is not the good way of making», indicates Hasso Plattner, president of the society of software of German firm SAP.
If one wanted a strong European industry of the TI, then it must not be let die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from the coal at the cars, going by by the farmers.
All except the industry of the TI.
Nevertheless, the extent and the sophistication of the American agencies of espionage displayed by the revelations of Snowden have been a shock for some firms that thought until then that China represented the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A big change is happening in the computing in cloud since the European persons in charge have realized the fact that the data preserved in the United States are governed in accordance with the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to an inquiry realized by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organism, about 10 % of the not American members have renounced their projects of using an American purveyor of services of stocking in the cloud after the revelations on the American program of exploration of the data Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-manager of SAP, declares: «Our customers put to us today a question that they did not ask us a year ago: where are my data preserved and can you guarantee me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction? ».
Numerous German leaders indicate that the last relations are only a confirmation of what they knew already, that is to say that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data consequently must be kept to everything price
It is not amazing that economic espionage is.
There has always been some.
«It is a recurrent subject for numerous years and anything fundamentally has changed within the framework of the present discussion», declares Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of the producing society of chemicals BASF.
The Americans spy us on the commercial and industrial plan all as we follow them, because it is national in the interest to defend our firms
The leaders of firm are generally little prone to reveal the measures of prevention that they have set up, if that would leave an adversary the advantage.
The great societies hammer for long the message according to which it is at least careless to recover a free key USB during a lounge professional or of leaving a laptop computer without surveillance in a bedroom of hotel.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the board of directors of the car manufacturer Audi, declares that the collection of the portable telephones before the meetings of the advice so that they can not be used as devices of listening to distance, is an ordinary practice for years.
The BfV of Germany recommends his leaders to plan to use simple portable telephones prepaid during their journeys abroad because of the risk of attack to the integrity of the smartphones.
The prepaid portable telephones are afterwards crazy.
Though, one fears that the small ones and attracted averages remain vulnerable to the piracy and to the surveillance.
In Germany, a good number of SME is world leaders in their particular kennel.
«The SME lacks often the experience, the staff and the financial resources to protect efficiently their industrial secrets from a not authorized access», warns the BfV in a relation
The United States alert their own societies on the economic activities of espionage realized by other countries.
The National One Intelligence Estimate (DENIES) realized in February by the United States, quoted France, as Russia and Israel, guilty at the second degree of having carried out acts of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a famous German society considered that while it is a matter of economic espionage, «the French are the worst».
Bernard Squarcini, guiding antiques of the French interior information, the DCRI, have declared in a maintenance this month: The services know perfectly although all the countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against the terrorism, spy their allies. »
A tax on the foreign property owners to make the bubble of London burst
The Treasure provisionally has encoded the measure of the tax on the earnings in capital but expects a definitive decision from Mr. Osborne that, in the budget of 2012, has noted down a stamp duty of 7 % for the properties costing more than 2 M£ and of the annual expenses for the purchasers who chose to hold properties within the framework of a society rather than to title individual.
The stamp duty applies already to the smart properties of the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents 708 M£ on the fiscal exercise 2012/13, it that exceeds the total amount of the Northern Ireland, of the country of Wales, of Scotland, of the Yorkshire Northeast, of the North-West and of the region and combined Humber.
M. Cook has declared: «With reference to the increase of the stamp duty on the properties of great value and the introduction of the law anti-évitement on this subject, it is very difficult to suggest that the properties of great value are under-imposed independently of the effects of the system of obsolete property tax. »
«But this change could make the foreign investors reluctant to the idea to buy properties in London or the present owners reluctant to the idea to sell», it has added.
That property of prestige – the 5 at 10 % of the prices most raised from the market of that property – in the prosperous sector situated to the southwest of London that spreads from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased in a record percentage of 11.8 % in the course of the last year.
The prices in the center of London display a regular growth from year to year of 5.6 % but have been eclipsed by a «domestic market» in full growth, the south-west of the city, the north (7.4 %) and the east (6.5 %) experiencing a resumption, according to the studies of Savills.
The shutdown in the US has slowed down the rise of the self-propelled market
The closing for 16 days of most of the federal administrations has weighed on the growth sales of cars in the United States in October, show the numbers published Friday by the builders five of the six main ones having realized performances inferior to the expectations.
The three great builders of Detroit stick up a growth to two numbers in relation to October 2012 but only General Motors has made better than waited for.
The analysts anticipated on average 15,4 million sales in rhythm annualized and corrected of the seasonal variations but the market has established itself at 15,3 million according to the appraisals d'Adam Jonas, analyst of Morgan Stanley.
In a bill to the customers of the bank, he considers that this light blow of brake explains itself in first place by "the governmental 'shutdown' and his impact on the feeling of the consumer in the course of the first fortnight of the month".
GM nevertheless has stated a progress of nearly 16 % of his sales the last month to 226 402 vehicles, against 211 563 waited by the consensus.
The four brands of the group have seen their commercial performances improve in relation to October 2012.
Ford, which continues benefit among others from the success of her pick-up, has seen his sales progress of 14% towards a year to 191 985 vehicles, even though the consensus waited for 194 301.

A study destined to multiply the advantages of the railroad project HS2 for Scotland has been launched by the British government.
The work realized by HS2 Ltd leaves to think that the services to great speed up to Scotland and the north of England will start up from the opening of the Stage 1 in 2026.
The minister of the Transports baronizes Kramer has declared that the project «would gather the United Kingdom».
The Scottish minister of the Transports, Keith Brown has told to itself «excited» to the idea by working with the British government on the project.
The Stage 1 will deal with a new railroad line to great speed between London and the West Midlands.
While the Stage 2 will be finished, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government has revised to the rise the estimated cost of the building of the link to great speed between London and the north of the England, passing from 32.7 Md£ to 42.6 Md£.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked to HS2 Ltd to study the reinforcement of the railroad capacity and the improvement of the duration of the journeys for the north of England and Scotland.
That must include the possibility of durations of journey between Glasgow and Edinburgh of three hours to the more.
The baroness Kramer has declared: «Our objective for HS2 deals with a truly national network that will approach the United Kingdom and his cities. »
We move the project HS2 because the advantages that it presents are enormous.
Without it we are confronted with a problem of capacity of our railway network.
But it is a matter also of developing the connectivité between the 18 great British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links among them are better thanks to HS2.
The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, has added: «The announcement of today is a good news for Scotland. »
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown has called Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland «without equivocation» in the network HS2.
M. Brown has declared: «The train to great speed has the potential of offering sizeable economic advantages to Scotland, but it brings also the economic weight of Scotland in the global project of railway network to great speed in the whole Great Britain.
«Therefore we are excited to the idea by working in partnership with the British government in order to examine the options aiming at taking the network of train to great speed up to in Scotland, creating an advantage for everyone and completing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is planning already.
«I am impatient to read the relation of examination with the British ministers next year and we will decide then on the next stages together. »
The UN greets the new objectives in favor of the fight against the poverty
The United Nations are going to start from at present to work on a new series of objectives destined to replace the objectives of the millennium for the development (OMD), which had been set up 12 years before to fight against the poverty in the world.
The Australian diplomats have played a key role in the bet forward of the «objectives of lasting development» destined to replace the OMD, which will breathe out in 2015, before the Summit of the United Nations on the lasting development that has begun the day before to Rio of Janeiro.
They appeared in the final avant-projet of the document, which will be adopted by the world leaders, including Mme Gillard, in the course of the summit.
The secretary general of the UN Round of Applause Ki-moon has said on the eve of the summit that it now was time «to exceed the national interests».
«I am happy that the Member States have accepted to throw and to appropriate the process aiming at setting universal objectives of lasting development (ODD)», it has added.
These ODD will rely on the progress realized within the framework of the objectives of the millennium for the development and will be part integrating of the frame of development post-2015.
I will make the maximum to fulfill the mandate that has been entrusted to me by the Member States to realize our vision of the objectives of lasting development that are based themselves on the success of the OMD.
The parents of intersexed children can choose «indeterminate sex»
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for the infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or feminine sex of the new ones born will not be attributed to them anymore, in a rigid way, at birth.
Within the framework of the new law, the parents no more will be obliged to declare the sex of their child, allowing to them to note down an «indeterminate» sex or«not specified» on his birth certificate.
The goal of the law was of taking off the pressure that weighed on the shoulders of the parents that could make decisions thrown regarding a surgery of sexual reallocation for their infant, and to fight against the discrimination contrary to the intersexed people.
According to the BBC, an intersexed person would have said years later, «I am not either a man or a woman. »
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors have created, contused and gashed.
One values that a child on 2 000 born every year, is not either a boy or a girl
They are intersexed, the intersexuality being part of the group of the sixty illnesses diagnosed as disorders of the sexual development, a generic term referring to the people possessing chromosomes or atypical gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sex organs.
Wallis Simpson would have been able to be intersexed.
The sexual identification is well not always included but most of the specialists in the United States say about the child that while the sex can not be determined, it is worth to use better the best information available for attributing it to wait then and to follow the psychological and physical development before envisaging a surgical act, in this case.
Dr Jack Drescher, psychiatrist to New York and specialist in the questions of sexual identification, has declared that the new German law «seems to be a good idea».
The intersexed children put an ethical dilemma.
«Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require a surgical act, but it is not the case of most of the children», it has added.
It is possible to make an assignation sexual without operation, and to see how the identity develops.
The science that consists that is to say how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
Nobody can reply to the question of knowing why that happens.
It is as the mystery that people surround the homosexual people.
A relation subjected to the European Commission in 2011 described the intersexed people as transsexuals, different from the people, or transkinds, since their statute is not related to the sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not either exclusively that of a man or exclusively that of a woman, but is in general the two at the same time and not clearly definite as being one or the other one.
These characteristics can appear of themselves in the secondary sexual characters, (as the muscular mass, the pilosity, the chest and the stature), the primary sexual characters (as the reproductive organs and the sex organs) or the structure of the chromosomes and the hormones.
The relation gave also a survey of the discrimination to which were confronted the intersexed people and transkinds as regards job as the extent of the acts of harassment and of violence and of the crimes motivated by prejudices.
The young boys of non-consistent kind have henceforth camps that are especially intended to them.
Australia and Nepal allow already the adults to note down male, feminine sex or «third sex» on their official documents.
In June, an Australian of 52 years, Norrie May-Welby, has become the first person to the world to have been pleaded «neutral» after to have won his trial in call that allows him to keep a sex« not specified» for life.
The German passports will comprise a third designation beside M or F – X for intersexed, according to the ministry of the Inside.
In neighboring France, the questions of kind are always the subject to controversies, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozen legislators of this foncièrement Catholic country have signed a petition so that the «theory of the kinds» is withdrawn from the textbooks.
The American site Catholic Online is itself also opposite to the German law, writing only «since the world is dragged in a new reign where the kind is a choice but where the sexual activity is not one, one knocks over two other pillars of the civilization. »
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also has declared on Baby Zone that it préfèrerait that a sex is attributed to the babies to their birth.
«The role of parent is sufficiently stressing out without additional restrictions, in particular if you do not know the sex of your child», it has declared on the site intended to the related youths.
The children need stability and certainties.
Historically, the children born without male or feminine sex organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And hardly ten years ago, the medical community considered the kind as a slate, which one can erase and on which one can redraw.
But henceforth, numerous are those that question the ethical foundation of the surgery, knowing that the sexual identity is complex and that sometimes the doctors can make a mistake, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reallocation while it will grow.
«In the middle of 20th century, one called that a psychiatric urgency», has indicated Drescher.
While these children were born, one did not call the psychiatrist, one phoned the surgeon.
The dominant theory on the way of treating the provided children as ambiguous sex organs has been launched by Dr John Money, of the university Johns-Hopkins, which considered that the kind is malleable.
It has hallowed the term «sexual identity» and maintained that the social and environmental signals – the way whose parents bring up a child – interact with the genes and the hormones of a child to shape it so that it is identified as being of sex male or feminine.
But in a case of 1966, known under the name of «John/Joan», his theories have given rise.
He had recommended the parents of a small boy whose penis had been cut during a botched circumcision to make it castrate entirely, taking him also the testicles, and to raise it as a girl
«Money has presented that as a successful case of transition, but it was not the case», has declared Drescher.
To the age of about 15 years, he has become a boy and has married a woman.
But at 38 years, he has committed suicide.
Drescher has declared that some doctors «always repeat this model».
But in the years 1990, with the arrival of Internet, those that have survived these operations of change in sex say«[qu']ils are not satisfied with the result».
Such a is the case of Jim Bruce, a writer of 36 years of Montana, that has arisen with male chromosomes XY but ambiguous sex organs.
The doctors could really not say if it had a wide clitoris or a small penis and were convinced of his being able never to have a «satisfactory life» as man.
Therefore little time after his birth in 1976, Bruce has undergone a surgical ablation of the external organ and of the testicles and has been raised as a girl
One has made to him to take feminine hormones to the age of 12 years.
«I knew that I was not a girl it has declared on ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but asking questions was really difficult.
At 18 years, it has undergone a vaginoplastie.
But depressed and realizing that something did not go, he has asked for his medical file.
What he has discovered has horrified it
I have not been sterilized at birth – and nobody had ever told it to me.
Bruce has been born with a disorder of the sexual development (DDS) that has prevented his body from producing sufficiently of testosterone so that his sex organs can develop.
After having learned the truth, he has become a man, following a treatment to the testosterone and has made to take off the breasts.
The surgery has made it sterile.
Today, it defends the cause of the others in an organization called Interface Project, who tries to normalize the perception of the intersexed people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, general manager of the organization to not lucrative goal based in Californie Advocates heart Informed Choice, feared that the German law «induces to the labelling and to the stigmatization».
«Numerous activists worry that the German law encourages to the parents to make fast decisions and give to their child an "indeterminate" sex», it has declared.
We are afraid that it encourages the interventions.
We think that it would be worth to attribute better a male or feminine sex, and to wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, therefore we can only bring forward hypotheses.
Tamar-Mattis has declared that his organization supported the Australian law because «it allows the adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex appellation».
«The adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind », it has added.
The German law concerns the attribution of the sex at birth.
It is not a battle that the young children should lead to that age.
While they will grow, they will be able to make decisions regarding their own body.
But Dr Arlene Baratz, radiologist specialized in the mammographies to Pittsburgh, of which the girl is attack of a disorder of the sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a group of support, has declared that the German law «will give» responsibilities the parents and the children.
The girl of Dr Baratz, Katie, has been born with male chromosomes, but she suffers from a DDS called syndrome of complete insensibility at the androgens.
Because of the weakness of his receivers of androgens, Katie has developed feminine characteristics.
It has a vagina, but not of uterus nor of ovaries.
Today aged of 29 years, Katie is married and interns in infantile psychiatry to the university of Pennsylvania.
Although it is sterile, she expects from adoption or from carrying mothers to have children by the intervention of services.
«The law leaves some latitude to the parents so that they do not have to set of precocious decisions», has declared Baratz.
That leaves the time of making some tests and of including them to them, and a deadline before noting down «male» or« féminin ».
Thus, everything is fine – you can bring up your child and love it
You have a magnificent baby and take advantage of the pleasure of being related.
You do not have to throw oneself for a surgical intervention that is irreversible.
«That puts the children to the heart of the decision and lessens the feeling of anxiety that motivates the parents because they are afraid of not making what is needed», it has declared.
Finally, the child will decide with what il/elle sex him feels le/la more comfortably – and it is something tremendous.
That allows the child to make the decision for itself
An octogenarian receives children with a rifle at the Muy for Halloween
The minors aged of 9 and 13 years made of the door to door to ask for candies the night of Halloween.
One of the residents of the area of the Muy visited by the children has opened the door keeping his hunting gun.
The old man, aged of 86 years, has explained fear to the policemen that it had had.
His weapon has been seized
The shout of despair of a voter of Obama
I have voted for two times for the president Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says about the republican Party that Obama has made commendable efforts foiled by the obstructionism
The obstructionism does not forgive the difficulties of the site Obamacare, or the attacks of drones
The dissertation of the campaign 2008 of Obama is a sad recall of what would have been able to happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in 2nd year of medicine at the Faculty of medicine of Harvard.
I am reading a hideously sad book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage to me during the gloom of the 2nd year of medicine and would return hope to me.
It is called «The Audacity to Win» and it is a matter of the dissertations of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama of 2008.
When I have finished the medical accounts-returns of my patients the night and that I go to bed, this book brings back me at that time where the policies inspired millions of people and where the speeches could cut you whispers it.
The election has ended with an overwhelming victory and the presenters of the newspapers of news have taken the time of thinking about the historical nature of the moment.
My friends have cried for joy and my parents have preserved all the newspapers that they have taken on.
A young team of visionaries advanced to the House-White and the nation was ready for the change.
For the period of transition of Obama before his capture of duty in 2008, it had 82 % of favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult waking, it is as going out from a dream.
Remembering these days full of optimism is difficult, it is as distant memories, a sad recall of the opportunities of the past.
The change has really happened in the years that have followed the first time that I have voted.
That did not have anything to see with what I had imagined.
I put to the credit of Obama of great works, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (law on the reasonable care) up to the departure of Iraq of our army, going by by the end of the «neither seen nor known» and the murder of Oussama ben Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that the partisan obstructionism has destroyed de trop numerous efforts aiming at making our nation advance in the domain of the reforms of the immigration, of the public care of health and of the closing of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after having many times defended the administration of Obama in view of my peers and my colleagues, I do not manage anymore to supply with explanations.
I am political at the edge of the despair.
The republican obstruction can not explain the bet on listening of the foreign leaders, or the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It can not explain that the National Security Agency gathers data on the private life of the Americans, nor the indictment of the denouncers who reveal the misdemeanors of the government.
It can not justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial or the evasion of the public financings and the overtaking of the expenses authorized during the presidential campaigns
It can not justify the conclusions of a relation that says only the efforts of the House-White to reduce the media to the silence are the «more aggressive... from the administration of Nixon».
And, no more lately, she can not forgive the impossibility to conceive a simple Internet site for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I do not know if it is it that I expected.
So, at 18 years, I was supposed to understand that the gouvernance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it
Evidently, the electoral duty is not predictable, because the political party of opposition and the events that happen by chance, as the massacre of Newton, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples that I have listed above seem to be in great part the choice of the administration.
It is what troubles me itself the more.
Again I have voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was filled with enthusiasm by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented an alternative confused and little refined that did not seem to allow determining his policies or his positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second mandate being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that one intended to talk about for so long.
Nevertheless, even though the clue of favorable opinions has plunged this week under the 45 % of them, bringing back to the year 2008 through this book is still more difficult.
It makes me want the numerous promises that have flown away.
This week, I have read the part of the book that describes how Obama has undergone enormous losses for the benefit of Clinton to the Primary ones of Pennsylvania.
During a meeting of post-campaign it has said to his team that was needed that they get back on the good way and remain faithful to their cause.
«I want us to reorient us on our talent», it has declared.
We must remember that we are.
Us these are is you are 5 years after, Mr. the President, and I am not anymore agreed with you.
The viewpoints expressed in this comment are uniquely those of Nathaniel Morris.
The New Star has succeeded at a return in strength, side audiences, with 1.3 millions of viewers behind their post of telly, or 5,6% of part of audience.
But was the show to the appointment?
About 10 000 candidates have appeared to the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, sulphurizing it Sinclair, the one perched André Manoukian and Low Olive Tree.
On Twitter, the viewers have shared their comments.
Passed the excitation of finding their program favorite, a lot have been disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems really to have marked during first that bonus.
As every year, the first emissions of hearing mix a broad choice of budding singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Yet, on Twitter, one wants show, of the emotion, of the originality, of the music...
Fortunately, some have taken on their account.
They are numerous to have tempted the New Star, and sometimes even to have gone to the end.
Behind the screens of television, the vocations of singer to success are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition of making laugh.

Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of his foreign exchange market division according to two close sources of the file, what shows a new time that the world inquiry of the regulators on the suspicions of handlings of the money market starts carrying his fruits.
Some from the greatest banks to the world, notably UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperated with the regulators within the framework of the inquiries taken on the most important stock market to the world, where 5,3 trillion WAYS dollars change every day of hand.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended within the framework of the broadening of the inquiry that makes echo to the scandal of the handlings of the interbank rate Libor.

«The inquiry underway on this business continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and the other regulators», had declared a representative of the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file have declared that RBS had transmitted files of emails and of messages instantaneous, sent to and by an old trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, has left RBS in 2010 and would have been put suspended of his post of European person in charge of the trading for cash for the currencies by JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European person in charge of the trading of exchange for cash by Citi, has been put in leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior trader of currencies among Barclays and UBS, has been suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been the subject to any accusation.
The file of Mr. Usher included sent instant messages to and by bankers working among Barclays and Citigroup, have added sources close to the file.
UBS has explained this week that it had brought an action contrary to some of his employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, has declared that he held an inquiry on suspicions of handlings of the foreign exchange market in some number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission Finma, the authority of the Swiss competition Weko, the FCA, the American Department of the justice and the monetary Authority of Hong Kong – examine the allegations made regarding bankers that would have heard itself to handle the rates on the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Switzerland Credit also have launched internal inquiries or received of the requests of information of the regulators, have indicated sources close to the file.
The banks peel the instant messages and the emails sent for years to find cases of acts reprehensible.
The news regarding these inquiries has shaken the traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest motors of growth of the unity of trading of the banks of investment in the course of the last years, but who has been replaced causes this year because of the weak volatility of the currencies that limits the opportunities for the speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the business saying that it is nearly an impossibleness of manipulating the vast foreign exchange market strongly liquid, but the senior traders explain that that is not necessarily true.
A senior trader has declared that in spite of the high volume of the daily transactions of exchange, the fragmentation of the liquidity between the plate armors-forms of management of the exchanges and the more and more frequent use through the banks of their own internal plate armors-forms «explains to few expenses» that starting having an impact on the market is possible».
The news has happened on the day even where the Switzerland Credit has announced to have sent back a working trader to his office of the negotiated funds the Stock-Exchange of London this week after it has caused a loss of 6 M$ in end of last year.
The bank rapidly has informed the competent authorities and has cooperated with the regulators.
«We are convinced of the trader having acted alone and the business having been «mastered», has indicated a representative of the Credit Switzerland

Obama makes walk back on his reform of the system of health
Under an avalanche of criticisms the president Obama has come back yesterday on his promise without ambiguity and often repeated according to which if you are satisfied with your system of health, you can keep it
After hundreds of thousands of people have received opinions of termination of their recipients, the republicans have criticized the president in the course of the last days accusing it of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama has adjusted his promise of origin.
«The great majority of people holding a health assurance that invite them can keep it it has declared during a speech in Boston.

The homage to the folk music of the brothers Coen
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the brothers Coen, Great price of the last Festival of Canes, is a nostalgic and funny film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music music that began everything fair to resonate, before the arrival of Bobsleigh Sunhat Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject to a retrospective at the French Cinematheque, had swiped the Palm of gold at Canes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
For want of being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have thrown their devolved on the rising star of the American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years, but also on the planetary star pop Justin Timberlake.
In this film stuffed with humor where the music is a central character and the songs interpreted en direct, Oscar Isaac reveals one musician and singer of folk music fulfilled, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop one for the folk music music with an infectious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she has left the rich attires of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the magnificent one" for less shiny clothes, a sweet voice when she sings, but the swearword produced to the submachine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells towards a week the tribulations of a singer of folk music that does not happen to pierce and gets angry with the whole earth
He accepts backwards the substitutions at the drop of a hat in the studios.
Without accommodation, it makes the round of the sofas of his friends who want well still to receive it
An air of documentary
"His relationship with the success is tortured, it is what interested us: a mixture of misfortune, a lad who is not there at the good moment, which is not a careerist but integrates, with a selfdestructive behavior," declared to the press Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and prize for Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis has not existed, the two fan directors of folk music music have built their history on true personalities of the time as the folk music musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was of showing the moment preceding the accession of Greenwich friendly village, this area of New York called to become "the epicenter of the flight of the folk music music that would create international stars" as the journalist Elijah Wald writes it, of Van Ronk.
The film takes then appearances of documentary, of the dusty label of music invaded of 33 T unsold dwelled by an old priceless secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and to the coffees where the singers happened
The magic of the brothers Coen occurs still integrating a funny one of character who crosses the film permanently: a magnificent red cat to the lovely glance, companion of fortune of Llewyn Davis.
Questioned on the way whose actor it has composed his character of which, and whose singer Justin Timberlake had reminded to "have grown in Tennessee, bathed by the blues and the country".
"My first lessons of music to me have been given by my grandfather who has taught me to play the guitar", it had added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary "to be considered as good", "the chance also can launch the career of somebody", and "more and more today".
As Llewyn Davis that refuses every compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career "the more important it is not to let itself wedge by all what can prevent us from expressing oneself".

Espionage of the NSA: the United States "have gone too far", admits Kerry
The United States sometimes have gone "too far" as regards espionage, has recognized the secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in full debate with Europe on the massive collection of data by the national Agency of safety (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, of revelations and of denials between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time that an American governmental person in charge admits explicitly practices debated in the interception by the NSA of communications and of data in Europe.
"In some cases, I concede it to you, as the president has made it, some of these actions have gone too far and we are going to check that that does not happen anymore in future", has declared John Kerry during a conference in London that he participated in from Washington Thursday, October 31st by link video.
In his intervention broadcast, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the leader of the American diplomacy in a long way has justified the practices of information and of collection of information by the necessary antiterrorist fight and the prevention against possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of September 11th, 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry has assured that the American authorities had for foiled of numerous projects of attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"In fact we have avoided that airplanes fall, which buildings do not explode and that people are murdered, because we were in a position to knowing up-river of these projects", has argued the boss of the American diplomacy.
And, has asserted John Kerry to the address of the Europeans, "I insure you that in this process of the innocent people" have not been "deceived".
But we endeavor to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it has gone too much far from inappropriate way", still has admitted the secretary of State, which had already had to express itself on this international scandal during a last round the week to Paris, London and Rome.
It has assured Thursday night that preside over it Obama was "resolved to try to clarify oneself and that it conducted a re-examination of these practices so that nobody feels deceived".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data of hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
The newspaper, which quotes documents obtained next to the ex-consultant from the NSA Edward Snowden, maintains that programs it called "MUSCULAR", and led with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows to these two agencies recovering data from the optic fibres used by the giants of internet.
To think some one of the documents, about 181 million elements had been collected in the course of the only month of last January - going from metadatas on e-mails, at elements of text or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied every connection to these practices.
Since ten days, several great newspapers in France, in Germany, in Spain or in Italy, have revealed that the NSA would have intercepted data massively and communications emanating of allies of the United States and of their leaders, notably the German chancellor's wife Angela Merkel.
In view of the anger of European States and then that escapes in the American press maintained that the American president did not know such listenings Barack Obama has refused to express oneself on that subject, invoking the national safety.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, the general Keith Alexander, has shone denial that his agency of information has won tens of millions of communications of European citizens.
He has even sent back the ball to the European services of information that would have seized these communications, before supplying them to the NSA.
That would concern "military operations" in countries where these allies of the Otan cooperate with the United States and that would not aim absolutely Europe, has asserted the general Alexander.
And the debate was spread Friday in Asia.
Indonesia has convoked the ambassador of Australia, whose mission is marked of being used by the Americans within the framework of a vast network of international espionage that has also aroused the ire of China.
Precocious puberty: Growing old earlier
Studies show that the young afro-américaines and Hispanic girls have tendency to reach the age of the puberty earlier than the young white girls
The physical changes do not mean that the puberty is imminent
Nothing proves only the hormones or that of other chemical substances is responsible
The experts think that the epidemic of obesity could be a release mechanism of the precocious puberty
The tendency around a precocious puberty is so not pronounced by the boys
The previous correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialized journalist in the family questions and of health by the child.
Must a mother worry if the breasts and the pubic hairs of his girl start leading into 7 or 8 years?
During the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics that has been held this week to Orlando, in Florida, Dr Paul Kaplowitz, pédo-endocrinologue, has explained that these precocious physical changes are ordinary enough among the young Americans and represent a new norm.
«I spend a lot of time to reassure the parents – in general, that does not indicate a fast evolution around the full puberty», has declared Kaplowitz.
The evident signs of development, such as the budding of the breasts, the hairs under the arms and in the pubic zone and the corporal smells, appear earlier at the girls
But there has been only a light overhang of the age of the first rules in the course of the four last decades.
In the United States, the average age is of 12 years and a half, even though it was of 12 years three quarters in 1970.
«Once the chest has started developing, at least two or three years are needed before the first rules appear», has indicated Kaplowitz, also the author »of« Early Puberty in Chorus Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem».
The time is the most precise test to know how the puberty is going to evolve.
There is a debate regarding what constitutes the real appearance of the puberty, but it is considered as «precocious» while the development of the chest is accompanied with a sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most of the cases, the development slows down or it stops is something that a pediatrician can follow close up.
A faster evolution can justify tests realized by an endocrinologist to remove serious problems as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to warn about other consequences: a premature ageing of the bones that can slow down the growth and a small size to the adulthood.
The recommendations as regards medicinal and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with the medicines but he admits that «the fact of controlling the puberty can lessen some problems of behavior and the sensation for the young girls of being different from the others».
The other great problem is comprehensible: The parents do not want quite simply not that their very young girls have their rules.
«They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way in which they are going to manage the questions of hygiene», has declared Kaplowitz.
«That has been a shock», that a woman whose girl has had his first rules at 10 years remembers
Even if there were signs and that we had talked about the rules, it was not prepared emotionally.
It has fit from the school frightened and distressed by being the first among his friends.
There are numerous theories taken to the knowledge of the public on the causes of the precocious puberty.
Nevertheless, there is not any coherent theory according to which the hormones contained in the milk or of other foods, the present chemicals in the environment or the sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
The boys, as the girls reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz maintains that the most credible hypothesis is that of the epidemic of obesity.
He has participated in a study taken on aged girls of 6 to 9 years that binds the percentage of fatty mass to the release of the puberty.
Other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are numerous other influential factors
In this country, the young afro-américaines and Hispanic girls have tendency to reach the age of the puberty earlier than the young white girls
There are diverse explanations.
To the world ladder the mechanisms of the precocious puberty seem to be influenced by everything, of the economic conditions to the climate, going by by the genes.
Other problem: Although the boys have hairs on the face and in the pubic zone younger, the tendency to a real precocious puberty is also not pronounced than by the girls
Other doctors participating in the conference of the AAP have stressed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of the acne and of the pubic hairs is ordinary, even by the infants and the babies.
«We must be careful as for the way in which we identify the real appearance of the puberty», has said Dr Lawrence Silverman, a pédo-endocrinologue working to the hospital for children Goryeb to Morristown, in New Jersey.
The parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice to know how to speak with their child.
«That can mean to have a conversation more early than foreseen», has explained Kaplowitz.
If you remain quiet, your child will react well in general.
The girls whose puberty is precocious must be reassured on the fact that, even while that happens earlier than predicted, the process is part of the life.
A driver rolling at 210 km/hr with a warm drink between the legs has seen itself inflict an almond of 1 000 lb
A motorist has seen itself inflict a fine of 1 000 lb to have rolled at 210 km/hr with a warm drink put in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years, of Tiptree in l'Essex, has been spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on l'A120 to height of Braintree on May 27th.

A previous hostage in Lebanon: "The return is complex enough to manage"
Taken off Beirut March 8th, 1986 with three members of his team of "Antenna 2" come to film a demonstration of the Hezbollah, the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin has been freed close to 21 months later, on November 27th, 1987.
Reprocessed for 2008, he has participated in 2004 in the creation of the association of defense of the hostages "Hostages of the world", that it presides for several years.
His main objective: obtaining the possibility for the hostages of lodging a complaint and of taking their hostage takers in front of the international criminal Court
Held more than 1 000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret have been freed Tuesday.
After checkups to the military hospital of the Val-de-Grâce Wednesday afternoon, they have been able, for to find their families.
And trying, gradually, to recover the lesson of their life.
"The New Observer" has questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years, ex great tall reporter, reprocessed for 2008, president of the association "Hostages of the world".
From the night of your release, you were on the tray of the 20 hr of "Antenna 2".
What are today your memories of your release?
On site notably, in Beirut.
When I am freed, I find myself in the chest of a car that I meet - without seeing it because it is black - Roger Auque.
It calls me "one is freed", but I am not sure, and tell to myself that one can still be killed.
One is very excited, but very tightened also.
It is the war, and those that drive us are them as very tight
They depose us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian servicemen.
One arrives afterwards on the site of the hotel Summerland where the press is present.
French lead us the embassy of France.
It is the time of the first phone calls to the parents to the family, to the friends, at the press...
I remember to have taken a bath for an hour.
And having dined in t-shirt at the embassy of France.
I remember also a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is always there because we do not have means to evacuate us to the airport of Larnaca in Cyprus.
Happened over there in helicopter, one takes a private airplane that brings us back in France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How has your arrival taken place on the French ground?
One lands at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is there.
It is a bit brutal.
There is an incredible hustle.
And many media.
When I have left there were three television channels.
I come back and there is some full.
The descent of the stairs of the airplane, the reunions with my son and my parents my friends, all that is extremely loudly in emotion.
Between the airport and at my place, numerous motorbikes follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motorcyclists clear off the stuffing to make photos and follow me up to by me where I must make a little the police to prevent some from going up.
The media pressure is enormous.
That does not stop, we are well placed to know it...
But the state of emotion and of tiredness is such than seeing light is difficult.
One goes out of a hole and one is suddenly under the media fires
It is a bit complicated, a bit violent, complex enough to manage.
But one has made the hardest.
The soir-même, I belong to the 20 hr, the day after as I am to the telly.
Begin afterwards a kind of readjustment to the life, very sweetly, for one or two months that are a bit as vacations.
How have the checkups and the debriefing DGSE happened?
I had had medical control right at one first in Corsica
The rest has been made in the Val-de-Grâce the next days my return: radios, examinations in all kinds and meets with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that makes everything but one knows that one can count on it to remind it if need, that one is not not delivered to ourselves.
That is part of the procedure.
I have also met the services of information.
They have asked me questions on the hostage takers.
It was logical.
That has not hampered me.
How do you react, today, to the release of the four hostages of Niger?
I listen to what is said.
The debate on the ransoms notably.
Some things irritate me, of other minuses.
I try to make the part of the things between the questions on my past as hostage and my cap of president of the association "Hostages of the world" that allows me to put distance, and seems me well more interesting to board.
I question myself about the definition of the ductility for example.
Especially, I fight, with others, for the gratitude of the legal statute of the hostage.
There is according to me a problem of semantics.
It is needed to describe the taking of hostages as taking of hostages "policy - what is the case most of the time - and to allow the hostages to have access to the justice to lodge a complaint and to take their hostage takers in front of the international criminal Court
Today, everybody is once furthermore, in the compassion, in the emotion, and looks forward to the release of these hostages.
But that says that these hostages maybe could have them also access to the justice
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why one would not tell to the hostage takers "you have scorned the rules of the war, as those of all the conventions of Geneva, one is going to take you in justice
That seems me nevertheless founded, legitimate, struck of the common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and that shocks me.
It is my main fighting.

The Wolf of Wall Street: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets get away some pictures of his next film of which the rôle-titre, that of an ambitious New-York broker, is incarnated by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and take out your tickets
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to dishevel you in his role of removed trader.
Martin Scorsese relates us the true history of a "broker in Stock-Exchange of Length Island, which refuses to collaborate with the authorities within the framework of a vast business of corruption in Wall Street."
In the years 80, Belfort Jordanian goes up then one rips off who will make of it a rich, very rich man.
The occasion of following his incredible rise, but also the vertiginous fall that will follow itself
Beyond measure, the man puts together the parties, the women, drug them.
Decadence and excess in every kind are the word masters of this mad history
The couple Scorsese-DiCaprio seems to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The exit of the new Scorsese has fallen behind because of his too long assembly.
It would seem that the film lasts finally 2h45.
In room on December 25th, he will be able to participate barely in the race to the Oscars.
The Stock-Exchange of London has closed on the decline Thursday, ashen by the bad results of Shell and at the following day of an announcement by the Fed of the maintenance in the state of his support to the economics, as expected.
In La Seyne, the rehousing for cause of rats turns to the debate
At the beginning of week, a family has left his apartment in first floor of the Fructidor building D2, because of the presence of rats.
In the face of the urgency of the situation, the manager of the service Ground of the Habitat South, has offered, in an exceptional and provisional way, to rehouse the couple and his three children in a T4 nine.
Nevertheless, the family refuses "financier for reason" and the situation is blocked.
The business has seized by the exaggerated proportions, values Joël Canapa, the manager of the service.
Of the rats, always there has been some in the cities.
The firm of rat extermination realizes two passages per annum, and besides, we intervene, to our load to every request for the inhabitants.
We have thus carried out 64 interventions, from the end of the last winter.
The area is not left à l'abandon, and the rats do not pullulate in the city.
For reasons of protection of the environment and of public health, the products of rat extermination are four less efficient times than by the past, indeed, but for two rats, one is not going to kill a kid.
"We have not invited the rats at our places ", defends the father of family that has left his accommodation to settle to the hotel.
We are soon without the cent and we wait for a new accommodation, to the same price that the antiques.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create in boarder a structure of défaisance ("bad bank") gathering 38 billion books (45 billion euros) of active the riskiest, measure destined to release his relationships with London and to accelerate his reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce of 55% to 70% the proportion of the dubious active ones in his assessment in the two years to come and hopes to have cleaned completely this in the three years.
RBS has also said about books that it would note down a supply for additional depreciation of the dubious beliefs of four at 4,5 billion towards the term, a writing related to the constitution of the structure of stationing.
RBS has also clarified that this internal restructuring would free of 10 to 11 billions books from capital, reinforcing thus his capacity for stretching.
The bank and London have underlined that the "bad bank" would allow drawing a line through the past, the government having been in particular marked of interfering in the management of RBS.
"Now we can go of the front, the future and the 90% of the active ones that appoint a bank really domestic to worry and to build a great bank for the customers and for the United Kingdom", has said the new chief executive officer Ross McEwan to the press.
George Kerevan: The split of Europe gives the choice to the Scots
Another day, another worrying history of independence.
This time, one warns us that an independent Scotland would be obliged to join the European zone of free circulation to be able to adhere to the EU.
And this is you are are that one hears histories of passport control to Berwick and of a border of barbed sons along the wall of Hadrien.
If it is true that the newspaper of Strathclyde has indicated the possible economic fallouts of a greater freedom of circulation with the rest of Europe, that did nevertheless not appear in the headlines (and it was to be foreseen).
Nobody neither has not said that the Member States of the EU devote a great part of their time to bypassing their formal rules while that sorts them out.
Since Scotland is not part of the space Schengen for the time being, a continuous non-respect of the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in equivalent of all it which she wants to obtain from the Scots.
It is therefore a matter of a history that is not one.
And a so old history that it is now congealed: I have heard for the first time the fib according to which «the independence means the passport control» for more than 40 years.
Nevertheless, one has forgotten a point interesting in this interpretation of an old dusty story.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, actually?
Why to exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, in particular maintaining?
These are is you are the real topicality regarding Europe: the great plan of post-war period aiming at unifying Europe is definitively at the neutral.
With the crisis of the euro, the Europe Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, the parties that oppose the EU or that militate in favor of the abandonment of the euro as common currency, win from the ground.
Even in Germany, the euro-skeptic party Alternative for Germany, founded only this year and not arrived of anywhere, has gathered nearly five million voice during the federal elections of September and has taken out the democratic liberal Party (equivalent of our Liberals-democrats) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project of creation of a federal Europe.
Though, the present economic crisis has marked a turn.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the constraint weighing on the domestic economics by the intermediary of the adhesion to the unique currency, has driven numerous people to think that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro does not have much to see with the national governments that record excessive budget deficits – that was uniquely true for Greece.
The European system has rather made to weigh on his members exchange rates favorable to the German exporters – it which the German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of Europe of the south meet themselves with a problem of intrinsic productivity in relation to Germany.
The only resort is of making cups dark in the salaries and the public expenditures – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the topical budget and monetary problems, there is a deeper uneasiness related to the productivity in Europe.
With reference to the «green» energetic policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize the French and German societies of the sector of the energy to the expenses of the consumer – the European industry pays two times more for the electricity and four times more for the gas than the United States.
It is a matter of a damning drawback in terms of costs, as we have already seen it at Grangemouth.
All the frosts of salaries to the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry of being penalized by a gas of good American schist market.
As a result, the revolt rumbles, in particular in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite has considered the EU as a means of controlling Germany and of putting Paris on a foot of equality with Washington.
But Berlin does not need Paris anymore as passport of his legitimity talks about politics and has imposed his own economic policy in Europe, letting the French economics put to harm struggle.
Result: the party of extreme right of Navy The Pen, the anti-European National Forehead has just taken away a crucial by-election, dismissing the socialists in power to the third place
The National Forehead is henceforth the most popular party in France with 24 % of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labor Party that reminds him that he can not leave from the principle that a schism of the right will favor the left automatically.
That is Marine Le Pen with his new popularity next to the French white working class?
She wants to use the European elections of the next year to create a unique and anti-European anti-currency block within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties make good face to these elections, what is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is you are are what I think: very soon, the anti-European feeling and unique anti-currency in Europe is going to be unified and will end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will fall to «something that will look more like «the» free «Europe of the Nations (sovereigns)» favored by the General of Gaulle.
Germany and some of his satellite economics could preserve the euro, but France and the Europe of the south will find their own currency.
I expect what the United Kingdom takes his distances in relation to this project, and I hope that it will make the eyes sweet in the United States.
Though, the interest growing of Washington for the Pacific lead to think that Great Britain will be left for account in the Atlantic.
And Scotland, in all that?
We can decide to be a region of the small England (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, what includes of sending Berlin and Brussels to pass.
I believe that Scotland could adapt to a freer European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.
The cooperation with the other countries to the similar sights would be easier in a not federal Europe of the Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and preserve our economic independence.
The government SNP of Scotland is – and it is to be noticed – the political movement anti-austerity that has the one better succeeded in Europe, since it has taken away a spectacular majority in 2011 based on his opposition to the dark cups proposed (and implementations) by the Chancellor of the chessboard Labor Party member, Alistair Darling, and the coalition conservatives/Liberals-democrats that has followed.
It would be ridiculous now for the Scotland of voting for the independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
A house the prey of the flames in the Old Person-Quebec
A fire that has gone off Friday midday in the Old Person-Quebec rapidly has been mastered.
More than thirty firefighters have been dispatched at the 9 of the street Hébert.

End on duty for the cook leader of the French presidency
Entered to the 500 m2 of the presidential kitchens as committed after having worked in embassies, the cook has climbed all the steps up to becoming leader there are nine years.
It has served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande going by by Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their holiday resorts, and fed an incalculable number of big of this world in a almost--anonymity that it breaks only today, on time of the retirement at 60 years.
The man to the open face, bald skull and glasses of intellectual, born October 24th, 1953 to the Ferté-Saint-Aubin is a holder of a CAPE of cake shop
His mother was itself cooker in a castle of Sologne.
"I have passed of a castle the other one"!, gibes Bernard Vaussion, which knows not only the quirks of the six presidents for whom he has officiated, but also of their wives and of some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the leader of the State either his companion or wife who chooses the menus", it reminds.
"Mme Chirac was implied a bit more, it came directly in kitchen", so much so that it had forbidden the women in the kitchens of the French presidency!
Does not dislike to leaders of State that displayed a relative indifference to the land nourishments, "they are all gourmands", denounces in a kind way Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac had indeed "an a bit more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates came back empty!
As for François Hollande, who has restored the cheese, "it is somebody that loves to eat" and "there is not much that he does not love".
The present leader of the State, which has regained the kilos lost before the presidential campaign "does not have request for specific system
Bernard Vaussion remembers also the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, in particular during the dinners of State in the French presidency: one must serve "between 200 and 250 people in an hour about".
The night that precedes is practically white.
Those people would not understand that mistakes are.
The henceforth previous leader of the kitchens of the French presidency, which has taken a glass Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pang to the heart". François Hollande has come to greet me".
He has said praises.
"His human side has gone out again", it tells.

The inquiry on the mayor Rob Ford has been botched, supports a lawyer
After the police had confirmed to have put the hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking of the crack, Me Clayton Ruby has supported never to have seen an inquiry "also be botched".
Me Ruby has said to believe in The Canadian Press that civilizes it had "ignored or minimized" the elements of proof against the mayor.
This Thursday, the police have stopped the friend and occasional driver of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, aged of 35 years, and has it defendant of extortion in relation to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously defendant of traffic of drugs, was frequent in contact with the mayor.
The police have said also to have observed this man issuing parcels to Rob Ford, indicate new documents of court
Me Ruby has described as "inexplicable" the fact that the police have never searched the vehicle of Rob Ford or his domicile, or not wiretapped his telephone, maintaining that the Hooter Bill leader of police has chosen en connaissance de cause not to act against the mayor.
In accordance with the law, the police, having been a witness of suspicious transactions in own hands, would very well have been able to intercept the vehicle of Rob Ford, stop the mayor, and carry out a search - even without mandate.
It would also have been able to require a mandate of snapshot search, so considered necessary.
The leader of police has not commented, but his spokesperson Mark Pugash has described the intentions of Me Ruby as "evident and despaired attempt" to bring out itself next to the media in a business that in no way concerns it
In press conference, Thursday, Mr. Blair has maintained that there was not anything in this video that can constitute "reasonable reasons being able to take to the deposit of a criminal accusation against the mayor.

Explosion of a house at Gesves: a defective water-heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during an escape of gas.
The explosion of a residence to Gesves, which has made two serious casualties Friday morning, a grandmother of 52 years and his grandson of 5 years, is owed to an escape of gas coming from a defective water-heater, has indicated Friday night the substitute of the prosecutor of the King.
The expert dispatched on site by the parquet assures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother has lit a cigarette even though there were an escape and an accumulation of gas.
The vital forecast of the two victims is always committed.
The grandmother has been thrown by the explosion and is seriously burned.
The small boy, who stayed at his grandfather and his companion, was at his sides and has been burned more lightly.
"The two victims have been intubated and in a long way conditioned on site before being taken to the one FALLEN of Liège, it in helicopter, it in ambulance", has clarified the burgomaster José Paulet, brought down on the places.
Traumatized, the grandfather was at the story at the moment of the explosion.

The firefighters of Andenne and of Namur and the police of the Arches are intervened.
The civil protection of Crisnée has stabilized the two buildings trades.
A black box in your car?
Even though the planners of the road network of the United States have harm to find the money necessary to repair the freeway infrastructure in decrepitude, numerous those are that anticipate a solution in the form of a small black box that settles above the dashboard of your car.
The devices which record all the miles gone over by a motorist and pass on the information to the officials, are at the center of an attempt debated at Washington and in the governmental offices of the planning of revising the obsolete system of financing of the main American roads.
The sector generally without interest of the planning of the main highways suddenly has provoked a lively strong debate and of the eventful alliances.
The libertarians have joined ecological groups to make pressure so that the government uses the small boxes to keep the trace of the miles that you go over, and possibly of the road on which you circulate, to use then the information to write a fiscal bill.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union is it also very worried and expresses his anxiety regarding the protection of the private life.
And while the members of the Conference do not manage to start agreed to know if one must continue, several States have not waited.
They look how, in the course of the next decade, they will be able to pass to a system allowing the drivers to pay according to the number of miles gone over.
Thousands of motorists have already embarked these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a system of surveillance by GPS, for an experimental drive.
That is really essential for our nation.
«It is not as if we had the choice», has declared Hasan Ikhrata, chief executive officer of the Southern California Association of Governments, which foresees that the State starts recording the miles gone over by every californien motorist of here 2025.
There is going to be change in the way in which we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to make it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the Highway Trust Fund of the country, financed with the taxes that the Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
The Americans do not buy as much gasoline anymore as before.
The cars can go over more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself which is of 18.4 a hundred by gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
The politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even d'1 a hundred, even though the prices of the gasoline are high.
«The tax on the gasoline is not quite simply not bearable», has declared Lee Munnich, a specialist in the policies of transports to the university of Minnesota.
His State has lately made to install tracers on 500 cars to test a system of payment at the mile.
«That it proves to be the most logical alternative in the long term», it has said.
Wonks calls that of the expenses of use to the mileage.
It is not amazing that the idea seduces the urban Liberals, since the taxes could be used to modify the habits of behavior in order to allow reducing the congestions and the emissions of gas, for example.
The planners of California are interested in the system since they elaborate strategies to reach the objectives set in the ambitious laws of the State on the climatic reheating.
But representing it Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), president of the Committee of the transports of the House of Representatives, has declared that he considered it also as the most viable alternative in the long term.
The partisans of the open market of the foundation Reason appreciate also the idea to make the drivers at the mile pay.
«It is simply not a matter of a tax sinking in in a great black hole», has declared Adrian Moore, vice-president of the policy at the foundation Reason.
The people pay more directly for the advantages that are obtained for them.
The movement also is supported by two previous American secretaries to the Transports that, in a relation of 2011, exhorted the Conference to go to the way of the payment at the mile.
The American Senate has approved of a pilot project of 90 M$ the last year that would have dealt with about 10 000 cars.
But the presidency of the Bedroom has killed the suggestion, replying to the worries of the rural legislators representing voters who must go over numerous miles every day to surrender to their work or downtown.
Nevertheless Several States and great cities make progress of their side.
The most determined is the Oregon, which has mobilized 5 000 drivers to take the most important experience from the country.
These motorists will pay soon kilometric expenses at the State instead of the taxes on the gasoline
Nevada has eventually already led a pilot project.
The city of New York envisages one.
Illinois tempts a testing on a number limited from trucks.
And the coalition I-95, who understands 17 agencies involved in the road transport in States bordering the coast is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, the Virginia and Florida) studies how she could make use of the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 voluntary motorists have lately equipped their car with a device the drivers were worried that the government can follow their lesser facts and gestures
«The anxieties about Big Brother and this kind of things are a big problem», has declared Alauddin Khan, who directs the strategic management of the performance to the department of the Transports of Nevada.
It is not something that the people want.
From the beginning of the testing, the ACLU of Nevada warned on his site: «Transforming these devices into mechanisms of location fully would be relatively easy. »
It is not necessary to build an enormous and troublesome technological infrastructure that unavoidably will be widened to preserve the recordings of the ones gone and come daily of the people.
Nevada is part of the few States that struggle henceforth to find a reasonable technology that would allow to the State knowing how many miles a car goes over, but without experiencing the exact place or hour.
If one can make that, has added Khan, the citizens will be more comfortably.
The research of this technology has taken some agencies of State to call on a small start-up of California of the name of True Mileage.
Originally, the society did not intend to help the motorists who pay taxes at the States.
She tried to pierce assurance in the emergent market car, in which the drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices that she tests have pleased the planners of the main highways because they do not use the GPS and supply a limited quantity with information, loaded periodically by modem.
«The people will be more prone to make that if you do not record their speed and do not localize them», has declared Ryan Morrison, chief executive officer of True Mileage.
Big mistakes have been committed in the pilot programs of some States.
There are pretty less expensive means and pretty less intrusive methods of proceeding.
In Oregon, the planners tempt the experience offering the motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Still they can choose not to have device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles gone over by everyone the residents of the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to distrustful citizens allowing to the devices making some more, rather that not enough.
In the city of New York, the persons in charge of the transports try to develop a mechanism of taxation that also would be equipped to pay the expenses of parking, to supply an assurance «payment to the behavior» and to create a unity of data on the speed in time reality from the other drivers that the motorists could use to avoid the traffic jams.
«The motorists would be incited to participate because of the advantages that the system offers them», has indicated a document on the urban conversion.
Though, some planners of the transports wonder if the whole debate on the payment at the mile is simply not an enormous diversion.
In the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the zone of the bay of San Francisco, the persons in charge say about the Highway Trust Fund that the Conference could very simply manage the bankruptcy increasing the taxes on the gasoline
An additional unique or annual tax could be imposed on the drivers of hybrid vehicles and on of other of which the vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline so that each pays his fair part
«Resorting to a radical surgery while one quite simply needs aspirin is not necessary», he has declared Randy Rentschler, the manager of the legislation and of the public businesses next to the commission
If one makes that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about the protection of their private life and of a pile of other things.
The British police issue a mandate of extradition to the encontre of Assange
The British police have today issued a mandate of extradition contrary to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who has sheltered at the Embassy of Ecuador at London and has asked for the political home.
Scotland Yard has declared that she had issued an «opinion of delivery» contrary to the Australian of 40 years, asking it of appearing to a police station of police, adding that if it did not make it, it would be susceptible to be stopped.
Assange could be extradited in Sweden with reference to the allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all see them possible in accordance with the British law after the High Court has invalidated the call that he has lodged against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm authorizes his transfer to the United States, he has found refuge to the Embassy of Ecuador in London on June 19th, asking to this country of America of the south the political home.
Scotland Yard «has issued an opinion of delivery contrary to a man of 40 years who asks him to appear to a police station of police, at the date and the hour of his choice,» has declared a spokesperson.
He continues infringe the conditions of his release on bail.
The Embassy has refused to comment on the release of the opinion by the police.
Assange fears to be extradited from Sweden to the United States where it could be marked of espionage, after having unveiled more than 250 000 American diplomatic cables on the site WikiLeaks fighting against the secret information.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
The president of the Italian Advice Enrico Letta judges that his government will hold up to in 2015 in spite of the strong tensions between left and right within the coalition to the power to the approach of the vote of the Senate to demean Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate.
In an interview in the daily La Stampa, the leader of left center says to have "firmly the intention" of continuing govern with his coalition up to the next legislative elections of 2015.
The high bedroom of the Italian parliament will meet in the current of the month to decide of the fate of the previous president of the Advice sentenced for tax fiddle in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support to the government if the Senate, where he counts more adversaries than partisans, utters his dismissal.
But a part of his camp, gathered around the national secretary of the People of the freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues support the government, as has demonstrated it on last October 2nd his refusal to give in to the injunctions of Berlusconi that wished to make already to fall the office
For more than one year, everywhere, I am in a position to noticing a strong dissatisfaction on behalf of the people that I meet: monstrous revaluation of their properties, cool deluge of taxes, cost of the licenses of all sorts, administrative to not besides to finish.
In short, siphonage without limit of our pockets.
Millions of squandered dollars could be saved in order to allow a taxation much respectful with those that pay.
Every money taken de force to the taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
At Shawinigan, in spite of the closing of all the major firms one does not get angry as for the sumptuary expenses and to the maintenance of the lame ducks: poor arts center, strong grant at the City of the Energy, etc.
If these installations are not profitable, what does one sell them at the private firm or what does one demolish them.
Also noticing the expropriation of several properties in order to hold a major industry that has never come is depressing.
I give however a honorable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso in a kind of industrial incubator, but to what cost for the payers of taxes?
It is not to the public landings to invest in such firms but well to the private sector being based on the request for the consumer.
The citizens have been happy to learn that the lakes at the Fishing and Stacks will continue supply the city with drinking water.
Subsequent to the departure of all the industries (great consumers of water) and to the great decline of the population, the use of the water has considerably diminished everywhere on the territory.
Without wanting to suggest to waste it, the city will not lack ever water and the severe rules as for his use greatly could be softened.
In summary, realizing great things with the money of the others is pretty easy.
I would be ashamed of defending such an assessment.
With a rough debt of more than 200 million $, this city is not even no more capable of buying a pen without passing by some regulations from borrowing.
We are managed for more than 40 years by put a tie on with beautiful diplomas for the majority and I do not believe that a stockbreeder of sheep makes worse.
A worker dies buried under blocks of concrete
A worker of the building has died buried under tens of blocks of concrete, Thursday before-midday, in Montreal.
The drama has occurred around 11 hr, on the street Marquette, everything close to the intersection of the street Beaubien, in the district of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
According to every likelihood, works carried out on the foundations took place at this place for some time
A mitoyen wall of foundation had just been erected in the course of the last days.
The accident has happened at the moment where the victim had just arrived on the building site in order to recover his tools.
I passed by car and I have seen the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, has said Jeans Sylvan, who remains close to the building site.
I am unloaded and I have gone to take off the big bricks that covered it.
One saw only a part of his back, it is so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an aged man in fifty that worked for a firm of preparation.
Maneuvers workers of resuscitation have been tempted by the services of urgency, but without success.
The man has not survived his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Commission of the health and of the safety of the work has been dispatched on the places in order to hold an inquiry on the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The NSA questions an «internal mistake» and not hackers for the breakdown of his site
The National Security Agency striving in the shade has declared Friday that it was a bug that had caused the breakdown of his site public for some hours, and not the hackers as some had claimed it online.
«NSA.gov has remained inaccessible for some hours tonight because of an internal mistake that has taken place during a foreseen updating», has indicated the agency of espionage in a declaration by email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations according to which the breakdown was owed to an attack of denial on duty distributed [DSD] are fake.
Earlier tonight, the trackers of online waiters have noticed that the site of the NSA had been out of order for at least 6 hours, and some users can always not reach the site.
Earlier, a spokesperson of the NSA has indicated News at ABC than the sensitive internal network of the agency «was not at all» a compromise.
No classified information is in danger, has explained the spokesperson.
At least one group of online hacktivistes has maintained to be responsible for the breakdown of the site of the NSA by an attack DSD.
The attacks DSD aim at flooding a site targeted until the waiters are overloaded and that the site collapses.
The cyber-tactics is not not very sophisticated and the attacks are not destined to penetrate in the network boarder of the system aimed at.
The NSA in the past ultra secret, one time nicknamed the «No Such Agency», has found under the fire of the spotlights and strongly criticizes in the course of the last months with reference to a wave of revelations about his vast programs of surveillance of the communications at the national level and abroad – that are part of the secret files of the NSA stolen to the agency and divulged by the previous consultant disenchanted with the NSA, Edward Snowden.
This increasing controversy around the agency has caused many speculations according to which the incident of it night was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The now closed Delta Centre-Ville
The hotel Delta Centre-Ville has closed his doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The fund of investment that possessed the edifice has sold it to promoters who are going to transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have not always taken on new job
Delta promises not to let his employees fall.
Employers have come to meet employees directly on site, one has met individually the employees to evaluate their needs.
"That support is going to continue for the six next months", explains the regional manager of the relationships of work of the Hotels Delta, Félix Bisson.
The closing of the Delta intervenes in a very competitive hotel market.
The fund of investment that was an owner of that house had choices to make.
Is it re-invested in the house to continue make it therefore there were investments of tens of millions even though the competition is very ferocious, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or is it sold it to somebody else and it is what has happened", explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Pulpit of tourism Transat to the School of the sciences of the management of the UQAM.
Other hotels of Montreal will also be converts in the next months, as the Crown Plaza that will become a residence for aged people.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totalizing nearly 600 bedrooms will see on the day of here two years.
Do you have desire of a fluo ice?
A British contractor has created the first fluorescent ice at the world to base of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has gotten out party of the fluorescent properties of this sea animal to develop a luminescent collation.
It has had some the idea after having read a study on the jellyfishes and has persuaded Chinese scientists to recreate the shiny protein chemically.
The frozen cream reacts with the language increasing the pH of the protein to make it sparkle.
Chris explains that, since the frozen cream starts shining when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more one licks, the shinier it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the society of ices «Lick Me I'm Delicious», has declared: «It is something incredible but we are not still only at the beginnings in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about 200 lb. »
The protein that we use in the ice reacts with the language to neutral pH.
Therefore while your mouth heats up the protein, the level of pH increases and the ice starts to sparkle.
We have tested it in the course of the last months and it seemed timely to share it with everyone at the moment of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary shiny effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice that I have created because the luminescence of the jellyfishes is four times worth more expensive than the gold.
Every ball costs me therefore 140 lb about.
But it has rather good taste!
The society to the experimental move of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for his unusual perfumes of ice such as the beer the cheese, the ox and the leaf of gold.
But his next creation looks still more ambitious.
It has added: «I would want to develop really an invisible ice. »
It is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the crystals of ice that constitute the frozen cream, but I think that I will find a means of happening.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthetized by Chinese scientists.
An one seriously injured in an accident with a ghost driver on the ring of Brussels
An accident of the road has made a seriously injured, Friday morning to 5h30, on the interior ring of Brussels to height of Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
The car of a driver has been struck into by a ghost driver, which is it unharmed.
The ring has been closed to the circulation, up to 9h00, to the place of the accident, the time that the road is cleared and that an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
This situation has hardly caused though traffic jams because the accident has taken place to height of the exit Hoeilaart.
The circulation has been able to be deviated ever since by this exit of the ring.
A child seriously hurt in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A child of five years has been seriously a casualty subsequent to an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital forecast is not engaged anymore but he is always hospitalized.
At the moment of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It has been closed up to new order.
Snowden is ready «to cooperate» with Germany on the question of the American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the denouncer of the American information services, has declared that he was disposed to go to Berlin to testify German in front of the parliament if the National Security Agency des États-Unis and his manager Keith Alexander did not supply replies on their activities.
The German deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele has met Thursday Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he benefits from the right of asylum, to discuss of his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the deputy has presented to the media in Berlin Friday, Mr. Snowden said: «Although the result of my efforts has been of every positive obviousness, my government continues treat the difference of opinion as an escape and tries to penalize the political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend oneself. »
To say, however, the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden has written that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the American government of abandoning the criminal loads kept against it
Within the framework of the complaint put down by the American ministry of the justice it is marked of espionage and of flight of goods of the State.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, minister of the German Inside, has declared to the Zeit Online: «If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to the German persons in charge, we will see to it of making that possible. »
The relationships between the United States and Germany have been tested severely subsequent to complaints according to which the NSA had wiretapped the portable telephone of the German chancellor's wife Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who leads the parliamentary group supervising the foreign secret services, has indicated that if there was a luck of hearing Mr. Snowden as witness «without taking it in danger and completely ruining the relationships with the United States», one must take advantage of it.
M. Ströbele, German Green deputy, has published a photo of it with Mr. Snowden on his account Twitter.
During his visit in Russia, it was accompanied of two German journalists.
M. Ströbele has declared that, according to the lawyer of the consultant antiques of the NSA, Mr. Snowden could not return in Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, the assurance that it would be in «safety» over there would have to be given him he has declared the deputy.
M. Snowden has written in his letter that it had been the subject to a «serious and supported» campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his country.
Though, he has said «about political expression» that he had been encouraged to by the world reaction in view of «my act».
The citizens of the whole world as the responsible tops – including in the United States – have judged that the revelation of an inexplicable system of surveillance perms was of public usefulness.
The letter brings forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities «while the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will have been solved».
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new kind of dolphin with hump off the northern coasts of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and the Study of the Animals and Sea Environments (OCEAMM) comes back for The Express Train on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
Does the discovery of this new kind of dolphin at hump surprise you?
It is a good news, but that does not surprise me particularly.
If by the past, the species have been described and identified on morphological, anatomical and geographic base, today, the development of new tools such as the genetics allow us to improve our knowledge in sciences of the classification of the species.
Moreover it is not impossible that this progress in genetics and in molecular biology questions the classification or the membership of a species to a kind, a family, indeed even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, the morphologistes have classified the animals, on base of the morphological differences between the species.
Today, some of these classifications are questioned because of the progress of the genetics.
In the same way, two very close species morphologically have been distinguished thanks to the genetics.
It is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
Ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the dolphins to hump of the Pacific and the humpback whales of the Atlantic.
The recent analyses have allowed distinguishing four species.
Why is it a matter of a discovery of importance as the Wildlife Conservation Society has asserted it?
Of a conservation viewpoint, it is essential to experience these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore his genetic variability.
If this population was already known for long by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only at this place.
Ever since, if a problem of caused massive mortality by a viral epidemic or of accidental capture lands in the region, we could have business to the extinction of a species, rather than to a local disappearance of a population of a species more largely spilled on Earth
This loss of genetic patrimony would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or in the process of extinction according to the number of existent individuals on Earth in other words of the stock, and of the possibility that it has to restore itself neighbors from the stocks.
With regard to the species Underhas chinensis, which the population of the new discovered species is born of, his stock automatically has become weaker, making it thus more vulnerable.
Why is discovering new kinds of sea mammals rare?
The sea mammals are situated at the top of the food chain.
They live in, open homogeneous habitats, in which there are numerous genetic exchanges between the populations and the individuals.
This mixing of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, the more closed ecosystems favor the genetic isolation, which can eventually generate the creation of new species.
It is needed to know that the sea environment is the environment the less pretty well known.
One prefers to send robots on Mars, only of knowing surface of the sea what lives in the pit on the Mariannes, only at 11 kilometers.
One spends more money in the research of life on the other planets than in the sea research and it is high time that that changes.
Separates Palmer claims that the deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of paternity leave.
The multimillionaire deputy Separates Palmer advance that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of paternity leave because his girls could be encircled and to take advantage of this system.
The magnate of the mining extraction which contests the payment of a carbon tax of an amount of 6 M$, has brought out this argument to try to discard the questions regarding a possible conflict.
The Micrometer Calliper United Party could control up to four voices to the Senate, what could be crucial at the moment of deciding if the taxes carbon and open mines must be removed.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that alone the ministers could have a conflict of interest and has indicated that the girls of Mr. Abbott were ready to benefit personally from these policies
«It will have an important conflict of interest when it will be a matter of paying the paternity leave because if one of his girls is pregnant, it will have a direct interest in the fact that it obtains or not a leave», has declared Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially has declared that Mr. Palmer has taken away the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 voices after recounting.
M. Palmer has brought forward the idea of a revision of the system of hide of the votes to accelerate the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is finished?
«We need a better system», it has declared.
Why we could not have a system to which you can enter, seize your coordinates in a computer, vote immediately and have the result to 6h30 the day after morning?
M. Palmer has also criticized the use of pencils of paper to mark the ballot papers.
It is to be able to erase the result if somebody is not agreed?
To have, nowadays, a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The electoral Commission has studied the possible options in what concerns the electronic vote and has lately published a document of spouse thought with the Nouvelle-Zélande.
M. Palmer, 59 years, has declared that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties «very seriously».
The exercise of civil services is a question of public service.
«We do not look for reward, excepted the reward of the history because we must serve the community at a critical moment», it has added.
While numerous experts in equestrian demonstrations have met in Cardiff to clash and to take away the trophy of the Horse of the year, they knew that the competition would be rough.
But nobody expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a child of three years, win.
Not yet at the school and only some months after having made his first weapons, the baby and his Toffee Shetland pony have trotted during the three towers with a great easiness and have taken away the first price leaving the 30 other competitors adult behind them.
The two inseparable ones – which are same size – have been greeted for the presentation, the attitude and the style during the annual competition that has taken place at the equestrian center Sunnybank, at Rudry close to Cardiff.
Appearing against men and women in hats elegant melons, it carried his flat cap a bit on the side in way relaxed to make to unstring his Toffee pony aged of 2 years around the track.
Fenton has been greeted by the judges for his little common natural qualities of taming for a child of his age.
And Toffee has received very good bills for his presentation and his personality.
Fenton has had Toffee in present as his 3rd birthday in last March and has taken itself for with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30 years, has declared: «Fenton and Toffee make an excellent duo. »
They have appeared to and against everyone, but the two have swiped the cup in gold and the bow.
It was the second time only that it competed with Toffee and we were mad about joy that it has won.
On the track, people who did not know it thought that it was so phenomenal that they wanted to be made photograph with it
This young boy, of the village of Nantyglo, to of Ebbw Vale, in the south of the country of Wales, follows the traces of his aunt Sharon Howells, who participates in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Mme Howells has declared: «It was electricity in the air and everybody encouraged to him and applauded it. »
It has gone over the whole length of the track running and even if it seemed to be very small, it has done a wonderful work.
Fenton is mad about animals – he adores the horses, the tractors and the rural world and has two chickens that he takes care of.
In the way in which it has begun, he will participate surely soon in the demonstration of the Horse of the year – and I am sure about his making a beautiful benefit.
A spokesperson of the annual equestrian demonstration has declared: «Fenton has only 3 years but he knows how to drive his pony. »
They form a good team.
The judges have noticed that Fenton and Toffee looked well and the way in which they have marched on the track.
They search for a work of efficient team between the pony and the tamer – Fenton and Toffee have been the best on the track.
I am sure about his beautiful clothes having helped Fenton, it had really proud appearance.
The Defense Secretary, Rob Nicholson, has insisted to say that the hurt soldiers were basically not freed from the Canadian Armed Forces, and has underlined that a process of transition was followed by all the soldiers before their return to the civil life.
Attacked by the Liberals and the neo-democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson has assured that before their release, the members of the army followed a plan of transition in collaboration with their superiors.
All the hurt soldiers receive the appropriate care with a view to their return to the civil life and any of them is freed before being ready, it has asserted.
The detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money not allowing the hurt servicemen - that do not reply to the rule of "the universality of the service" of the requiring army that the staff is in a position to carrying out a series of tasks varied - of reaching the period of eligibility of 10 years required for the benefits of retirement
Notably they have quoted two cases reported by The Canadian Press, of which that of a soldier freed last Friday.
The corporal David Hawkins, a reservist of affected London, in Ontario, of the syndrome of post-traumatic stress, has been freed from the army in spite of his request of remaining a year furthermore in order to be able to receive a retirement fully indexed.
His case has occurred after that of the corporal Glen Kirkland, who has declared in front of a select committee, last month, that it had been moved to the exit before being ready because it did not reply to the rule of universality of the service.
M. Hawkins has underlined that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and sessions of consultation, but that that it was totally different that is it of wanting to leave the rows.
"I have told to them that I was not ready", it has asserted during a meeting with The Canadian Press Wednesday.
I have asked for months if there was a means so that I can stay, and they have said not.
From the beginning of the major fightings in Afghanistan, the army struggles to determine what latitude she can give to the hurt soldiers who want to stay in the rows, but who are not capable of the fighting.
In accordance with the present rules, the seriously hurt soldiers have until three years to restore.
If they do not reply to the criteria for the deployments abroad, they can be forced to leave the army.
Data presented the last year to the Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers freed for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the duration on duty required to obtain benefits from retirement
The liberal spokesperson as regards previous combatants, Jim Karygiannis, has asked for Wednesday the reinstatement of the corporal Hawkins, while the neo-democrat Jack Harris has asked the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli airplanes have entered to the Lebanese aerial space Wednesday at the beginning of afternoon, but the touches have taken place in the evening.
One load of missiles ground-air of short range SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of the air force of Tsahal in Syrian territory (the sixth from the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed either by Israel or by Syria.
The raid has taken place in circumstances more or less identical to the one that had taken place on July 5th: at that time, he is also an anonymous American person in charge that had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, aiming at this time of the missiles ground-sea Yakhont, delivered to Damascus by Russia.
The Israeli persons in charge had not hidden their irritation of seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of obliging the president Assad to react.
Prison for life for a previous Chinese vice-governor
A previous vice-governor of the province of Jilin, in the north-east of China, has been sentenced Friday to the prison for life for corruption.
Excluded from the communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was marked of having touched more than 19 million yuans of containers-of-wine, report the Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also the president of the Bank of Jilin, a public establishment, has helped firms and persons in charge to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in return for money or from presents, has declared the first court intermediary of Beijing on his microblog.
The president Xi Jinping, who has taken his duties in last March, has made fight against the corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon constituted a threat to the existence-even of the communist Party.
If the leader of the State has promised that the justice would also be inflexible with the powerful "tigers" that with the "flies" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of persons in charge of high row have been condemned, among which of previous frames of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case has been that of the previous leader of the PCC at Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced for life for corruption and abuse of power in September after having aimed at the highest duties within the State.
But the government does not have in no way shown the intention of reforming the system of fight against the corruption creating for example an organism independent from the party.
The profit of Bomber on the decline, even though the deliveries and the commands of airplanes move back
Bomber Inc, Canadian aeronautical and railroad builder has signaled a fall of 15 % of his net profit Thursday, under the pressure of a fall of the commands and of the deliveries of airplanes in the course of the third term and of contractual problems in his division Trains
Bomber, based in Montreal, does not have either not supplied with data of testing in flight for his very new airplane CSeries or of allowing information of knowledge if the airplane will respect his ambitious calendar of setting up commercial before next September.
About a month ago and half, the latter has stolen only three times, and the question then has landed of knowing if the stage of testing was in good way.
The results have not been to the height of the forecasts and the lesson of the actions has moved back of 8 % to the Stock-Exchange of Toronto.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst within the National Bank Financial, has lowered Thursday his notation, passing of «overperformance» to«performance of sector» because of the weak potential of rise of the grant in the course of the next term or of the two next terms.
«Although the fall of the deliveries of airplanes has been in great early part, really we are disappointed by the profitable margin in the Transport division », has declared Cameron Doerksen in a bill to the customers.
We think that Bombardier will record new commands for his airplanes CSeries as the program of testings in flight will advance.
Though, if any new command is not announced in the course of the next months, we expect what the market becomes more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the family of airplanes CSeries will be able to catapult it in the inferior segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first airplane of testing has been unveiled in March and has flown away for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm commands for the airplanes CSeries is modest until now to height of 177. It seems that the potential purchasers wait for the results of the testings in flight to validate the assertions of the society regarding the energetic effectiveness and the potential of economics of the new airliner.
At the Present Time, the society has recorded a total of 403 commands and commitments of purchase next to 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and leader of the direction is convinced of Bombardier reaching his objective of 300 firm commands before the setting up commercial of the first airplane.
The leaders also have reassured the analysts and the media Thursday indicating to them that the program advanced in accordance with the calendar.
«The airplane of testing has not remained to the ground longer than foreseen,» has declared Mr. Beaudoin during a conference telephonic, adding that the testings to the ground and the software updatings were foreseen for the time of stopping of the airplane.
Every builder plans in a different way.
We had decided to conduct a first flight and to foresee a period of updating, and it is what we have made.
That will recur throughout the program of flight
The second of the five airplanes of testing should fly away in the weeks to come, the others will follow little time after, has indicated the society
Nevertheless, the analysts are sceptical quant by the way that the first customer can make to steal an airplane CSeries only 12 months after his inaugural flight
Bombardier has indicated that she was evaluating the calendar of entry in operation and will supply information with news in the course of the next months.
«This slowness of the testings in flight – although apparently it is model on the internal calendar of Bombardier – reinforces our opinion according to which the entry in operation will be rejected at the first term of 2015», has declared Mr. Doerksen.
At the third closed term on September 30th, the net profit of Bombardier has fallen to 147 M$, or 8 a hundred by action in relation to 172 M$, or 9 a hundred by action a year earlier.
The result by action adjusted has remained unchanged to 9 a hundred.
The incomes have lightly moved back of 4.2 to 4.1 Md$.
The analysts expected a result of 10 a hundred by action and of the incomes of 4.56 Md$, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aeronautical builder to the world has indicated that it had delivered 45 airplanes in the course of the term, against 57 a year earlier.
The net commands have fallen to 26 airplanes, against 83 beforehand.
The delay in the Aeronautical division represented 32.9 Md$ on September 30th, unchanged number in relation to December 31st of the previous year.
«In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the weak number of commands and the general conditions of the market have been disappointing», has declared Mr. Beaudoin.
The incomes of the Aeronautics have lowered of 13 % to affect 2 Md$.
Bomber, the greatest railroad builder at the world, has declared to 2.1 Md$ that the incomes of this division had increased in nearly 11 %.
The notebook of commands of the Transport division totalized 32.6 Md$ on September 30th, or a slight rise in relation to December 31st of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division have suffered from the problems of execution regarding some big contracts.
The leaders have announced that new indications would be supplied in the course of the fourth term.
The lesson of the actions of Bombardier, which also has announced that Patrick Pichette, leader of the financial direction of Google Inc, siègerait to the board of directors, has fallen of 8.5 % to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
The Brazilian society Embraer SA, third aeronautical builder to the world and competitor the more close to Bombardier, has indicated Thursday a fall of 10 % of his quarterly profit.
The kenyane press condemns of the law debated on the media
«It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the next question to itself what will prevent the Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow? », has declared the newspaper contesting the bill and asking to what it is declared unconstitutional.
«This law is draconian and very punitive, and we refuse it has explained Cyrus Kamau, chief executive officer of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of the radio stations and sites Internet of topicality independent the most respected in Kenya.
It has indicated that the new court of the media will «be always partial because it is a matter of an extension of the government» and that the restrictions relative to the contents and to the advertisement would harm instead of Kenya in the world economics.

The model beep of 22 years does not begin his career at the cinema by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier has chosen it to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama drones, in eight chapters that will go out in two sections (the 1st and 8 January 2014), the erotic memories of a quadragénaire hooked on the sex for his adolescence.
The resemblance of Stacy Martin with her elder is striking: a silhouette of twig, a diaphanous complexion and franco-anglaises origins.
Without forgetting some taste of the risk: the one that had not hesitated to put nude on shiny paper is going to be displayed in well more sulphurous situations on big screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac has made the temperature go up on the Canvas Stacy Martin appears there at the bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative director has asked his actors to put their decency at the cupboard, it has had resort to professionals of the X as the scenes of sex most dared, before merging all the bodies numerically: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
Of Björk in Charlotte Gainsbourg, going by by Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has as habit to move his actresses in their last entrenchments, always for the best.
Stacy Martin has not finished to make to talk about it
Five years ago already that my father has erased itself of the world of the living beings.
Initially I have denied his death, I talked about it at the present,
I was so much afraid of forgetting it or rather I did not know how I was going to continue "associate" with it
There is not recipe, of fashion of job to pass the wall of the invisible one and to find hers
Then signs have appeared.
The first time it was the felt very strong one of his presence on the temporary seat even though I drove.
Another time, a sweet waking in full night to look at his watch that does not leave me anymore, put on the nightstand.
It is the picture of my cheerful father that accompanies me to my gestures to the daily.
Our mother has left us after his exhausting fighting against the cancer.
It is at least what I thought on the day where I found his empty body, shriveled on this bed of hospital to the crumpled sheets.
Similarly, his obsequies were an icy farewell focused around the thin light of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought that it had left.
Gradually, by small diurnal or night appearances, a bit shy, a bit erased, in a fast way it has come back to my mind evolving as it recovered his place in the landscape of my thought that was believed in mourning.
And then, it revealed all unveiling myself my own facets that yet I had not perceived, concealed by my relationship with it
Therefore I have learned and understood that I in no way had lost the person of my mother but simply a woman that I did not know really, a woman who incarnated this person, for his stay in the life.
Dying, this woman had perfect his life and freed the person that I loved, and these are is you are that I found it, full and whole.
This bend of the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege of knowing that the loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside as outside" it adorned.
One has always told it to me.
I have never believed it at that time.
I have had difficult relationships with it until it becomes old, ill.
There, I have not been afraid of it anymore and I have been able to love it
A day, it is dead.
During long, he has accompanied me: when I have stopped smoking, when I have been afraid, when I have ached...
He talked to me, encouraged to me constantly, it dwelled on my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never inquisitive.
I have been able to have a personal life.
It left me my intimacy.
That has lasted long then a day it has left.
Finally, it was comfortable and comforting to be included encouraged to, recommended
I do not know who said that the died people are not forgotten ones but invisible ones anymore.
My parents are not anymore but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every instant of my life makes me to feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have made?
I dream constantly of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.
I dream often of the last instants that I must share with them before it is too much late, only, there is a thing always that prevents me of fulfilling this moment.
I wake up often distressed while that happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and are in line with my history and indeed, they continue live and share my life.
The eve of my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I have dreamed that I woke up, I heaved up out of the bed, my father waited for me on the landing and it smiled at me and was delighted that I wait for a small boy.
The day after, I had the feeling that he had visited to me in my sleep to mean me that he shared with joy what happened to me.
And of course, he was a small boy in my stomach.
I have loved to share this moment with it and I take pleasure to tell this common memory lived after his death.
Precisely five years ago, my grandmother died of the continuations of a cancer.
A year beforehand, it was on journey with my family in Cuba.
It is to say the shock that his disappearance has caused at the young bachelier that I was at that time.
I have realized my mourning despite everything rapidly enough.
But it continues influence my life, notably in the moments where I feel in difficulty, or well while I must make important decisions.
Learning the Arabic and to be interested in the Middle East, to the point of making some a master in a great school, have not been, with the retreat, insignificant choices.
Actually, I heard it often speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, there where it had lived for decades - before regaining France at the moment of the independence.
The values that she has inculcated in me are always present, so well that it happens to me to think to how she would want me to act at a given moment.
It goes from there similarly for my attitudes: I try to be to the height generosity and uprightness of mind of that who was a religious devotee.
Henceforth, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving mind
I see his eyes land on me.
My mother died nineteen maintaining years ago.
Died after me to have spoken on the telephone.
I have passed by all the stages: the incomprehension, the anger, the pain, the tears that go off alone, anyplace, anytime, in unusual places, of the incongruous moments.
Then, the time has appeased the grief
Only the lack, this space without reply, this need of it of confiding of reassuring myself to the hollow of his softness, has remained.
Nevertheless, it is there, silent presence, it is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes land on me, I see the rings that weighed down his glance, the wrinkles around the lips that the cigarettes, the folds that mark the forehead the days of anxiety, dig.
My mother has taken possession of my face and it concerns me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I divert the eyes.
My woman and the mother of my 3 children has died of a cancer at 43 years.
One feels his protection permanently, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, then gradually one has relearned to smile, and to pronounce his name is not no more taboo but a comfort.
Well on, I talk to him in the hollow about the night when the absence overdoes it badly, it invites itself in my dreams when the morale a bit is reached.
We feel carried and protected in the difficult moments, the retreat of the time makes us realize how much it was a conductor and we try to stay in the way that it had drawn us.
If a being has loved you very loudly, the absence can not extract it from you of the heart and of the memories.
In some way, the loved being becomes your interior energy.
I have lost my father on August 22nd, 2008 of the continuations of a cancer of the asbestos.
I was very close to it always I have acted according to what he thought or of what he appreciated.
I have not been able to attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a small boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from hers I wonder always if my intrigues are consistent with his vision of the things.
Moreover I have had problems in my work as these convictions.
For me, it is impossible to go to a contrary sense I do not sleep and I wonder always what he will think.
I do not know if I have adopted his way of being or if I am simply as it is it genetic?
In any case, it will be always my reference.
It was a bit as an alter-ego, there was not need of speaking among us.
In short, it is there at the daily.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
Veiled soon thirty years that my husband has died to the age of 33 years.
I had 28 years and our son 6 years.
The immense grief that has then invaded me has of course died down but it is always close to me.
Very often it "unloads" to my dreams of a so precise, so alive way that to the waking I am still sadder of noticing that it was only a dream.
The other night, he has asked to me if I was fine, I have told to him not, him me reply "I go down" but of a so real voice that I have woken up in start, distressed and I have lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, persuaded that it was going to happen.
I live always in the same house, and often, I feel observed and I look back to see if it is not there, I know that it is it and I talk to him
In all the parts I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing to the world I would not leave this house where we have been happy and or his mind lives with me.
I have 58 years, always I have lived alone for his departure, it is and will remain the love of my life.
I insist on clarifying that I am sociable with a profession to responsibility, laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him and I do not talk ever about it except with my son, and I do not go ever to the cemetery.

The hurt person has immediately been hospitalized, according to the same source.
Policemen of the antiterrorist service have hurried on the central avenue of the suburbs Néo Iraklio, where the incident has taken place and have fastened up the area.
The incident intervenes some weeks after the charge of six deputies of gilded Dawn, of which the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" within the framework of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an antifascist musician by one of his members
The parents of an adolescent of Georgia, who has died in unusual circumstances, think that their son has been murdered
The parents of an adolescent of Georgia, whose body has been found in a carpet of fight rolled in the gymnasium of his secondary school, think that their son has been murdered, has declared the lawyer of the family Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta in Georgia, has been found on January 11th jammed in a carpet pressed standing behind the tiers of the gymnasium of his secondary school.

«They are absolutely some that their son has been «murdered», has declared Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They have never thought that it was dead as that is indicated in the conclusions of the sheriff.
«They think that that challenges every logic, the laws of the physics as the commun sense», has added Crump.
They are persuaded that these conclusions have been delivered in the only goal by covering the or the responsible people with the death of their son.
«They have sent their son to the school with a satchel and one has given back it to them in a mortuary bag», it has added.
The prosecutor of the United States Michael Moore has declared Thursday that it took an official inquiry on the death of Johnson, underlining that several important questions remained without reply.
What is the cause of the death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore has expressed during a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I am going to give with reference to the facts, where that they lead.
My objective is of discovering the truth.
«I consider that there is a sufficient base» to open an official inquiry, it has declared.
Moore has declared «positionnelle to the journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died by «suffocation».
Though, a second autopsy has identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
«Several questions deserve still a reply or a confirmation», it has indicated.
Moore has added that if he puts elements at the day by nature to justify a civil or criminal inquiry on the death of Johnson, he will ask to the FBI to lead it
The representative of the office of the sheriff of the county of Lowndes was not available for giving us his opinion while we have contacted it Thursday.
A judge of Georgia of the south has organized Wednesday to the authorities of replacing all the recordings of vidéosurveillance that the investigators had examined.
The parents of the adolescent have declared that they hoped that the video pictures contain clues on the circumstances of his death.
The ex-leader of Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, which has disappeared at the end of the Second World War without one never finding his trace actually has been buried in a communal grave of a Jewish cemetery of Berlin, asserts the leader of the Memorial of the German resistance, the teacher Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller has not survived at the end of the war.
"His body has been buried in 1945 in a communal grave of the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte", it has assured to the daily to great draw relying on documents of archives.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi system of Adolf Hitler, would reply great enigmas to one of the post-war period.
The German secret services, the BND, assured as for the summer 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services totally made a mistake.
"From August 1945, the body of Müller has been found in a grave provisional close to the old ministry of the Air Force of the Reich by a commando", according to Mr. Tuchel.
It carried "a uniform of general".
"In the left interior pocket found itself notably his states on duty with a photo", it pursues.
Bild publishes also a document of the town hall of district of the area of Mitte in Berlin indicating that it has been buried in the Jewish cemetery of the area.
The president of the central Advice of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, has declared itself shocked by this revelation.
What one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is shelved in a Jewish cemetery, it is a hugeness of bad taste.
"One tramples coarsely of the foot on the memory of the victims", it has revolted in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is part of the important personalities of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He participated in the conference of Wannsee in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had notably Adolf Eichmann, person in charge of the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, under his orders sentenced to death and carried out in Israel in 1962.
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to lend oath
Mohamed Morsi has lent the oath of investiture, but it is little probable that his day of triumph marks the end of the political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi has promised the emergence of a «new Egypt» while it has lent the oath of investiture at the presidency, becoming thus the first freely elected president and following Hosni Moubarak that was driven away from the power 16 months earlier.
During his investiture in front of the High constitutional court Mr. Morsi also became the first Islamist president freely elected Arabic from the world and the fifth head of state of Egypt from the inversion of the monarchy 60 years ago.
It has lent oath in front of the 18 judges in black dress of the Court whose building trade situated in edge of the Nile has been built to look like an Egyptian temple.
«We aspire to better following days, a new Egypt and a second republic», has declared the president Morsi in the course of the solemn ceremony diffused en direct on the public television.
«Today, the Egyptian people have put the foundations of a new life – the absolute freedom, a real democracy and the stability», has explained Mr. Morsi, an engineer of 60 years formed in the United States, stemming from the Brothers Muslims, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years for his training as an illegal organization and in a hard way repressed by the successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen kept the building trade while Mr. Morsi has arrived little after 11 hours, local hour, followed from a small convoy.
Alone some hundred supporters had gathered in front of the Court to acclaim the new president and, distancing oneself from the presidential splendor of the years Moubarak, the circulation only briefly has not been interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy in the very frequented streets connecting the downtown to the suburbs south.
Considered as the «spare wheel» little charismatic of the Muslim Brothers, his prestige staff s is considerably reinforced from his victory and his speech of Friday in the course of which he has tried to appear as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those that want to finish the work started during the uprising of 2011 against the authoritarian president Moubarak.
«Egypt is today a Registry Office, national, constitutional and modern,» has declared Mohamed Morsi, in blue suit and red tie, addressing itself the judges presents in the room decorated with panellings where it has lent oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi has gone to the university of the Cairo where it has pronounced his investiture speech.
It has officially been received by a military fanfare that has played the national anthem even though he started the garde-à-vous.
The general Hussein Tantaoui has attended the ceremony.
To his arrival, it has been received by the singing «The people and the army, hand-in-hand... »put by thousands of people rallied in the great amphitheater of the university in barrels.
Based in 1908 and old bastion of the secular education, the university of Cairo has become later a fief of the groups of Islamists students in the years 1970.
M. Morsi has made an oath symbolic Friday on the place Tahrir, from where the uprising has left that has put an end to the authoritarian system of Moubarak last year, and has sworn to recover the presidential powers that the military advice which has replaced the previous ousted president, has dispossessed it of.
But accepting to lend officially oath in front of the Court rather than in front of the Parliament as it is of use, it bows before the will of the army showing that the fight for the power is not finished.
The speech of Mr. Morsi on the place Tahrir has been accompanied with spectacular populist gestures
The avionneurs scold themselves about the width of the seats even though big commands are at stake
The argument makes rage between the great aeronautical builders about the width of the seats of the tourist class on the long-courriers flights opening the way to a bitter confrontation during the aeronautical lounge of Dubai that takes place of month-here.
The conflict deals with the width of the seats proposed to the passengers of the economic class on the long-courriers flights – that are not always the most courted by the airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase the earnings of effectiveness in the last devices presented by Airbus LOCK and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus has called the aircraft industry to set up an imposing norm a size of seat of at least 18 thumbs (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but her big rival American Boeing declares that it should be up to the airlines to decide.
The disagreement has burst even though the avionneurs look for sale for still greater versions of their long-courriers airplanes twin-engined planes, expecting possibly a record of commands during the event that will take place from 17 on November 21st.
The way of which to the seats the back of the airplane will be disposed – in particular, 9 or 10 seats will be head-on – is essential for the economic yield of the segment of the« mini-jumbo».
Boeing declares that his reorganized «777X» will be able to receive 406 people in economic class in seats of more than 17 thumbs of width sea, and will be configured with 10 seats by line.
Airbus indicates that the rival version of his A350 will move 350 people in economic class in seats of 18 thumbs of width sea configured in lines of 9.
The giants of the aeronautics exchange often blows on technical questions making advertisement in the professional press.
Today, Airbus disputes it directly to the public before the aeronautical lounge of Dubai, where the 777X should take the step on his competitors with more than 100 commands
One has been able to realize lately of it that could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people ones against the others to the restaurant, titled Is it that you would accept that? ».
«Boeing proposes long-courriers flights in narrower seats than in the regional turboprop airplanes», has indicated John Leahy, business manager of Airbus.
As the food habits change, the people put on weight, but the seats in the airplanes have radically not changed.
Between the beginning of the years 1970, while the jumbo 747 of Boeing has defined the modern long-courrier journey, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American of 40 to 49 years has increased in 10 %, according to the data of the American department of the Health.
The turn of size of the average American of the 21st century is of 39.7 thumbs according to the American sanitary statistics.
Airbus declares that his rival clings to a concept of seat that dates back to the years 1950, while the circumference of the device coolly called «jet set» was narrower.
Airbus adds that it has ordered a study that indicates that an additional thumb as regards the width of the seats would improve the quality of the sleep of 53 %.
Boeing contests the numbers of Airbus in it that concerns the width of the seats and maintains that deciding on the way whose airlines balance the price of the tickets and the equipment is not up to the builders
He says about the seats that the study shows that the experience in cabin does not depend only on the width also.
«It is really a matter of bringing suppleness to the airlines and of allowing them to make it which they intend to have to make to see through their activities», has declared Kent Craver, assigns some of the satisfaction passengers by Boeing.
They do not want one to tell them what will allow them to be profitable.
They experience their firm better than nobody does.
For the passengers, it is more a matter of having some freedom of movement, but for the purveyors, it is more and more a question that could affect their results.
Behind the argument is hidden a race to the commands of airplanes for a valued amount of at least 700 Md$ to the price of the market in the decades to come, sufficiently to make to tilt the pair of scales of the American and European exportations.
As Reuters has indicated it for the first time in July, the shape of the seats is exactly what feeds the battle between the very last devices
Airbus and Boeing claim all two a yield by seat in their last models of twin-engined planes long-courriers 20 % superior to that of the leader of the market in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performances announced by Boeing depend in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats by line and a model 777 of origin configured in lines of 9.
The earnings in terms of unitary costs are weak compared with the device configured with 10 seats by line presently in operation.
«Boeing made that to be able to put more seats and to give back his more competitive airplanes by relations at our products,» has declared Kevin Keniston, manager of Temporary Comfort by the European avionneur Airbus.
Of another side, the analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats by line in the 777 existent ones suggest that of numerous passengers pronounce in favour of a denser shape which can go hand in hand with less expensive prices.
«A width of seat of 18 thumbs would be perfect for the passengers, but the reality is that, of the commercial viewpoint, the suggestion of Airbus is motivated by the threat of the 777», has declared the expert in insides of cabins Mary Kirby, founder and editor in leader of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but propose a catalog of purveyors among whom the airlines must choose.
The salesmen of airplanes that go round of the world take a meter even with them to verify the rival shapes
All being itself windy of proposing comfortable devices all the builders offer also airplanes with shapes to strong density to the low-cost airlines and for the regional journeys.
Airbus offers a A350 configured with 10 seats by line but it indicates that it has not yet sold it
Up to lately, Airbus underlined the necessity of a greater customisation of the cabins offering broader seats side gone on some of his airplanes.
Without the support of the only other great builder of big modern devices the experts say that it is little probable that his call to the aircraft industry with a view to setting up a norm of size for the seats succeeds, but that it could make forget the wave of sales of 777X.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of the novel of Denis Diderot boasts about a remarkable artistic direction and about a meticulous reformation of time, but it is also more laborious than it should be it
Taking place in the France of the years 1760, it tells the dark history of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent in a convent by his family.
While it rebels, it makes in view of the cruelty without milestone of a deliberately sadistic Mother Supérieure and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never lapses into the lustfulness or the sensationalism, and it is well the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narration could also become a penance for the public.
The musical, this animal of scene
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or in French, the sung and danced productions take their takeoff.
Finally, after Broadway and London, Paris takes on his voice
It is a revolution: the musical one at the French one asserts itself as a kind to success.
Long, of Notre-Dame of Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most of the attempts got mixed up in the absurdity.
And the successes as Cabaret or The Wretches carried the aureole of the mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin to the Châtelet and from Stage­ ­Entertainment to Mogador has changed gives it
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as tubes to success.
The first recovers, this Noël, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for following it the world creation of "An American in Paris".
To Mogador, "the Beautiful and the Animal" well could be one of the successes of the season.
On the other scenes the musical shows as "1789", "the lovers of the Fortress" and the small musicals as "Disco" or "Life and Times" put to the diapason of the success and of the quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the book of reference "Histories of musicals" and speaker at the Theater of the Châtelet, analyzes the reasons of the success in a so hard way conquered.
How do the French musicals evolve?
The offer is reduced itself
There are first the "musical shows" that evolve to the liking of the producers...
Some use of ­belles projections of pictures and a ­véritable history as in 1789, the Lovers of the Fortress.
Others make a leap of fifteen years backward on the pretext that one can serve more or less ­n'importe that when one has Matt ­Pokora in mind of poster.
After, one has the musicals with the sumptuous ­productions of the Châtelet that make us live the golden age of Broadway again and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest alive ­compositeur.
Training ­Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety adapting them in French.
The independent French ­producteurs tempt a ­percée.
But projects underway as "Rent", "The Kiss of the spider woman" or "The Awakening of the ­printemps" have harm to be financed.
We have enough capable artists as to Broadway of singer, to work and to dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it is a great year.
We have 200 artists of talent who turn from projects in projects.
In the United States, cradle of the musical, it is very different.
The youths are formed to these professions in numerous schools.
The jobs are numerous between the regional theaters, rounds, Broadway, the off-Broadway...
The fishpond of talents is as sizeable as the number of posts to provide is.
Why do the rounds in province have as much success?
Except for the opera, the province remains the poor parent of the culture in France.
Few plays leave in round and it is often of the ­théâtre of boulevard intended to the adults and not to the adult youths.
The musical shows fill in this ­manque.
It is these same youths that like the telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing handsome young men (often talented) in mind of poster of a musical show, it is the assurance of an infatuation of these young girls and often of their whole family.
The pages Facebook of these shows are in a scholarly way ­tenues by professionals who reply to the questions.
These shows are very waited for when they happen in a Zenith of province.
The mayonnaise has gone up to Paris and is tasted by the provincials.
The show is conceived to enter to all the great rooms of France under the same form as in Paris.

Ben Greenman: Tenth birthday of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that the city of New York is the place that the stand-up has been born in America: it is nearly 100 years, the actor of vaudeville Frank Fay, which has kept the role of master of ceremony to the Hotel Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly in front of the public, on the tone of the conversation.
The innovation of Fay has been perpetuated over the years, up to being recovered more lately by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the club of stand-up Carolines, the festival celebrates his tenth birthday this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and great theaters.
«Most of the heads of poster have emerged to the Carolines, and have known a great success, until they have become too famous to work in a club,» has declared Hirsch.
We have created this festival with the aim of being able continue work with them.
The event of this year will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of «Stand Up heart Heroes», an evening of comedy and of music for the benefit of the previous combatants, organized in the Madison Square Garden, to which will be present, between others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has seized by the extent, all as the world of the comedy.
Several of the actors participating in the festival of this year have passed through not traditional circuits, presenting for example shows on small television channels, as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has made his appearance on owing it of the scene in one sitcom on a cabled chain («The League» on the theme of the fantasy cheerfully lascivious football of the chain FXX) and has henceforth his own show of sketches on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has participated in the emission «Saturday Night Live» and has part been of the casting of the series« Parks and Recreation», but more it is known nevertheless for his series of viral videos« Marcel the Shell with Shoes On».
Kroll and Slate, as of other young actors to the singular voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of the racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of the American comedy.
One of the main factors of attraction of the festival this year will be a maintenance David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg has begun as actor of stand-up, but he has become a director of cinema and of television accomplished, as an unofficial historian of the comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, it has livened up an emission on TV Land that was called «Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg».
The appointment takes place at the Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.
«The city is definitively every work of Larry in the comic ADN», has declared Steinberg.
He told to me that, while it was here, sometimes it went down an alley between two buildings and maybe told Eh to itself well, if I lose all my money that I will come to live here.
Discovered from a tunnel of the drug between the United States and the Mexico having his own railroad track
One of the most sophisticated tunnels serving for the drug traffic between the United States and the Mexico, having his own systems of lighting, of ventilation and of electric rails, has been discovered.
The American authorities have described the tunnel of 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages that they had never seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant on an equivalent length to nearly six football pitches of length, connects warehouses close to Tijuana, in Mexico, in San Diego, to the United States.
The zone abounds in indefinable warehouses, what allows concealing the trucks loaded with drug easily.
The tunnel has been closed before the drugs have emerged from it being taken unnoticed, have declared the authorities.
The authorities have seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to the judicial files.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, have been marked of possession of marijuana and of cocaine with intention of sale.
They incur a prison sentence going of 10 years to the imprisonment forever if they are condemned.
At Nogales, in Arizona, the traffickers exploit vast underground canals of drainage.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego for 2006.
Some of the greatest tunnels have been discovered with reference to the harvest of marijuana in the center of Mexico in October, putting thus a challenge for the cartels of the drug that must rapidly deliver their products to the consumers.
In 2010, the authorities have taken on a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railroad tracks that left from the kitchen of a house of Tijuana and went up to two warehouses of San Diego.
Syria has destroyed his capacity of production of chemical weapons, declares the organism of surveillance
Syria has destroyed the equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and of ammunitions filled with toxic gas, has declared the international organism of surveillance of the chemical weapons Thursday, even though violent confrontations made rage in the north of the country, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stocked.
A group of Syrian militants also declared of the civil war in the country Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed from the beginning nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the ban of the chemical weapons (OIAC) has happened with a day in advance on the deadline of the
1st November set by the organization based in The Hague ordering in Damascus to destroy or «to make unusable all the unity of production of chemical weapons and the machines destined to mix the toxic gases and to fill the ammunitions.
The completion of what is the stage of initial destruction mainly is an important stage of the ambitious calendar aiming at destroying the chemical weapons of Damascus of here mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of the equipment, Syria will not be able to produce new chemical weapons anymore.
However, Damascus must still start up the destruction of the weapons and of the existent reserves.
One thinks that the country has about 1 000 tons of products and of chemical weapons, notably mustard gas and the neurotoxique agent sarin.
The announcement has been made even though the fightings made rage Thursday in the city of Safira that, according to the experts, shelters a unity of production from chemical weapons as from the sites of stocking, has brought back the Observatory Syrian of the human rights based in Great Britain.
The group of militants, which follows the evolution of the human assessment thanks to a network of militants based in Syria, has declared Thursday that 120 296 people had died.
Among them, one considers that there were 61 067 civilians, of which 6 365 children.
From the side of the government, one considers that 29 954 members of the armed forces of the Bachar el-Assad president have taken on the death, of which 18 678 were combatants of the pro-governmental strengths and 187 of the militants of the Lebanese Hezbollah.
Among the dead one considers also that 2 202 were deserters and about 5 375 of the combatants of the opposition, of which good number were foreigners.
On July 25th, the UN has considered that 100 000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She has not updated this number for
About 2 million people have had to escape the country because of the conflict.
The troops of el-Assad fight against the rebels, of which good number are related to groups of the network Al-Qaïda, to Safira for weeks.
The Observatory has declared of the losses of the two sides Thursday that was, but It has not given any precision.
The fightings have underlined the importance of the dangers to which are confronted the inspectors responsible for the chemical weapons even though they must finish their mission, which consists in disposing Syria of his toxic arsenal in the middle of a civil war that lasts, in tight deadlines.
A declaration of the OIAC, who works in narrow collaboration with the UN, indicated that his team was «now satisfied with having controlled – and seen be destroyed – the whole declared critical production and the machines destined for the mixture and for the filling».
It has added that «no other activity of inspection was foreseen for the time being».
More early in the week, the inspectors have declared that they had finished the first stage of the work of verification, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They have not been able to visit the two last sites because of worries regarding their safety, have indicated the inspectors.
Thursday, the OIAC has said that the two sites were, according to Syria, «abandoned and... that the elements of the program of chemical weapons that they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which» have been «inspected».
Knowing to first sight if the unity of Safira was one of the two sites that the inspectors of the OIAC have not been able to visit was difficult.
Syria has subjected a plan of total destruction of his chemical weapons that has been approved the month following by the Executive Committee of the OIAC.
«I greet the moral strength and the courage of which you have everyone shown within the framework of the most difficult mission ever attracted by this organization,» has declared the chief executive officer of the organization Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in his third year, the civil war principally opposes the sunnites Muslim rebels to the government of el-Assad and his strengths of safety, which are supported by the members of the sect of the alaouites, a branch of the chiite Islam.
On the other hand, the manager of the Syrian Observatory of the human rights has declared that there had been a strong explosion Wednesday in a base of aerial defense in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the unknown rest explosion, it has added.
Two employees of the YMCA marked of agressions sexual with reference to allegations stated contrary to Jonathan Lord, during an audience of the royal Commission
Two employees of the YMCA of News-Wales of the South have been marked of agressions sexual against children with reference to allegations stated contrary to the teacher of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, during an audience of the royal Commission responsible for the sexual abuses on the children.
But in his declaration of opening in the face of the Commission the YMCA has declared that it «had never had to deal with a problem of sexual agression on children within his organization».
The chief executive officer Phillip Hare has been questioned about two businesses one employee of the YMCA has been Caringbah Hall, marked of offenses relative to the childish pornography and a monitor of physical training of the YMCA, has been pleaded guilty of agressions sexual on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
M. Hare has declared to Gail Furness, lawyer next to the Commission which it had had knowledge of the first business but which he did not know of the second.
Also he has admitted that the declaration of opening of the YMCA was inaccurate underlining, «external controls of the YMCA have been carried out and have indicated that the safety of the children was an absolute priority for the organization. »
It has been demonstrated in the face of the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worse appreciations on four establishments during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities realized in August of this year.
M. Hare, who has started working on the YMCA to the age of 21 years, has admitted that the management of the staff has been a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that it had omitted of checking that the employees knew that they were obliged to signal every violation of the policy of safety of the children.
More early in the year, Lord has been condemned for agressions sexual on twelve boys for the two years where he has worked on the YMCA.
It has been sentenced to a grief of 6 years of minimum prison.
But Mr. Hare has thrown back the idea according to which the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing the staff from signaling the breaches of Lord to the safety of the children.
The members of the staff have testified that they had observed some breaches, notably the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that it kept them in private, he made them establish on his knees, he told them that he loved them and he let them play with his portable telephone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and who had asked for a training as regards protection of the children because it worried about his behavior, has indicated that she found the person in charge of the services at the childhood of the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, that supervised Lord «very intimidating and difficult to approach the majority to the time
The chief executive officer has said that it threw back the testimonies of the staff according to which they were reluctant to the idea to signal these breaches to their hierarchical superior.
Instead of that, he has declared that the friendly relationships that they maintained with Lord have blurred their sentence, it that makes that they have not signaled his intrigues.
M. Hare has declared that it had expressed his viewpoint in the face of the advice of the YMCA of News-Wales of the saying South that, for the organization, the lesson gotten out of «the incident Jonathan Lord» not did not have to concern the description» by the staff, and the advice was agreed with it
M. Hare has said what the decision of making to sign to the staff agreements of confidentiality, little after the allegations have been evoked, has been taken by the chief executive officer of the YMCA responsible for the services at the childhood, Liam Whitley.
He has declared that this decision was destined to avoid every contamination of the elements of proof but that it was a matter of an «excess of zeal» and that it had been harm made of use.
The YMCA of News-Wales of the South was not a sure organization for the children at that time where Jonathan Lord was used for it, that is to say between 2009 and 2011, has declared the expert as regards sexual violence on the children, the Teacher Stephen Smallbone of the university of Griffith owing the Commission
It has indicated that there were «serious problems» in the recruitment, the control, the initiation, the training and the supervision of the staff.
The audience has been rejected until December 20th.
A ceremony in dissertation of the crématisés deceased
The crematorium of the Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 hours, a secular ceremony, in dissertation of all the defunct crématisés in his establishment, in the course of the year.
Anne Hidalgo, socialist candidate for the town hall of Paris must attend it, and will explain afterwards, during a press conference his suggestions in matter of funéraire.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funeral, more and more French choose the cremation, rather that the burial: 53%, according to a study Ipsos realized on September 6th and 7th next to 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a close relation, it is the opposite: the French prefer the burial (53% against 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15 % to choose the cremation.
In his book The Death in ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the national Committee of ethics of the funerary one, stress the "violence" that the cremation constitutes, for the survivors.
It is with the cremation, "a violence made to the liked body", that is going to be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in very little of time and not after a process of decomposition, which would "accompany the stages with the mourning".
There is "a symbolic violence" also, who keeps to the "obliteration singularity and features" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without grief in some Nordic and Protestant countries, badly lived still in France?
"Because the cremation is a new fact", replies Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of thanatology and author of the book To Tame the death.
It is tolerated only for 1963 by the Catholic Church, what has limited the attempts to tame it
Taming the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, chief executive officer of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to foresee for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which it would have right with a burial.
The annual inquiry of Ipsos shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of the French want a, for their close relations, who it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Henceforth, 73% of the people having chosen a cremation wish for the organization of a ceremony.
66% of the atheistic ones or not believers also want it
The crematoria have adapted to this evolution of the society
"For ten years, "they endeavor to avoid the violence of a waiting to the families, without making anything, for an hour and half-hour, immediately followed of the delivery of the ashes," observes Mr. Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments propose henceforth masters of ceremonies, who conduct, in the presence of the body, the next ritual: receiving the assembly to name the deceased, to connect it to the others, to evoke it to give sense to his death, to organize the farewell.
It is the case at the crematorium of the Father Lachaise, for 1998.
The masters of ceremony are often people who have moved.
There are also previous Catholic priests.
It is in this frame that the crematorium of the Father Lachaise organizes, for 2010, on the day of All Saint's Day, several ceremonies of the memory, secular and not religious, which he invites to the families of the people who have been crématisées in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is broadcast lines up, for the attention of those that could not make the moving.
The crematorium has allowed us to replace it
Hagel reproaches to 9 for American States of violating the homosexual rights
Since the federal State has pleaded the marriage homosexual, "all the spouses of servicemen have right to an identity card of the department of the Defense and to the benefits that come with", has reminded the minister in New York in an owing speech the anti Defamation League of fight against the anti-semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards" to the spouses of same sex in the installations of the national Guard" introduced on their territory, it has denounced, reproaching to these States for violating the federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people can not benefit numerous social services or health supplied in these bases, or reach their stores.
The secretary to the Defense has said to have ordered to the leader of the national Guard, the general Frank Grass, to check on the implementation of the federal law.
The sling of the nine States has begun through the Texas that refuses to make of these benefits use on the establishments of the texane national Guard, because of a conflict between the texane law and the federal law on the homosexual marriage.

The Pentagon values the population concerned by the gratitude of the homosexual marriage to about 5600 people active, 17 000 including the national Guard, the reserve and the pensioners in it.
The price of the oil continues lower and approaches 96 $ the barrel
The price of the oil has continued lower Friday even though the worries regarding the importance of the stocks compensate for a relation showing that the greedy Chinese manufacturing sector in electricity is being reinforced.
The price of the American brute salary of reference for delivery in December has lowered of 14 a hundred at 96.24 $ the barrel in end of morning in Europe during the electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract has lost 39 a hundred Thursday, leaving it with a fall of 5.8 % for the month of October.
The plentiful offer of crude oil has weighed on the price in the course of the last weeks.
The American department of the energy has indicated Wednesday that the American supplyings had increased in 4,1 million barrels last week.
Towards five weeks, the supplyings have increased in more than 25 million barrels.
But two relations on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived Friday, which show a growth of the activity, suggest a rise of the request.
That lets suppose that the economic resumption of China could continue strengthen after the growth has bounced to 7.8 % at the third term, after a fall that one had not known for two decades at the previous term.
The brute salary Brent, a reference for the international brute salary already used by the American refineries, has lost 26 a hundred to fall at 108.58 $ the barrel on the Inter-Continental Exexchange (ICE) in London.
Return in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents his two new choreographies of group to Dance Dance: the first one inspired of the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second one inspired with by the first-rate solos of piano Gymnopédies of Satie.
An evening that allows seeing the whole prism of Chouinard, of the art to the tics and of the black of ink to the white.
A white screen serves as wall of bottom.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Theater Maisonneuve, advances itself of profile, end as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is thrown.
The body, simple feature takes his form
And this form will be that of the whole part a row of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, entirely dressed in black, lonely the discovered hands and face, wait of every side of the adventure playground, throw when the next written form appears, incarnate it go out again running.
This black and white game of Henri Michaux is made in intermediary of solos, in group to the unison (a mass that makes solo), in great group of twelve solos where each carries out his sign.
One thinks about "Glory of the morning", where, in solo, Chouinard carried out a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, put online to the apron.
It is the same principle, version gigantic PowerPoint.
Here, the music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, gives rhythm to it always express.
Break will be when Carol Prieur will shelter under the carpet of dance, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety nor deduction, a part of the poem of Midwhitewash, monotonous and monotonous in the auction, and will pursue dancing.
Both the music of going again, and the sequence of recovering.
This discharge sound and energetic, long, if that can itself ends up deafening and dulling.
As makes it also the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashs - the creation of pictures has always been a strength at Chouinard - as this hair that is tousled or these black tissues that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
One has the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting from the work of Midwhitewash, has dominated, with his tics.
Result: the bodies seem to dish in the face of the drawings.
The inks of Midwhitewash, as forms of Gestalt, open an imaginary one wider and giboyeux than the dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with his dancers chopped by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a theater in a sudden way black, touch to the magic.
The public has loved, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopédies, after the interlude, is richer.
The scene in part is draped of gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with tissues, as furniture in a neglected house.
At the piano, dancers are relieved to play the partitions.
Their clumsiness in music, touching, gives a true fragility.
On stage, the couples pass, in passionate, very sensual, even erotic duos.
Work of group, small solos of transitions, unity that moves, choirs, the writing is less binary.
Clowns appear, also familiar with Chouinard, wearing the red nose, in passionate parades men-women very polarized.
The loves are carnivorous, evasive or players.
The gestural one, the laughs and the small shouts transpose bellement the archaic one, the grace and the absurdity of the bodies in coitus, of the beings who found themselves.
But the part takes his real takeoff after the salvation.
A clown comes back in scene when the public leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth grave wall, the explored universes are superimposed, the dancers playact, go down among the spectators, annotate, smoke, are short-circuited, act codes of the clappings, stretch the sauce in a disorder in a scholarly way calculated that remains sensual.
The joy and the madness sweat, and contaminating the public is the art of Chouinard, there.
Important fire in a business
A fire has seriously damaged a business of the district of LaSalle, in Montreal, in the night from Thursday to Friday.

«The campaigns do not devote a lot of money to the surveys and to the discussion groups unless they plan seriously to take measures», has declared Martin on AC360.
However, one does not know if Obama knew that his team examined the substitution.
Martin has said about CNN that he had asked to Daley for if his boss of then was to the current of the possible revision.
Although Daley has said that he did not think that the president «has known»of the possible change, the previous secretary general has admitted »that it was« possible »that Obama has known.
Martin has added that «Down Doubles» did not reply in a definitive way to the question of knowing if the political surveys had happened on the office of Obama.
Cooper has asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama did not know that the eviction of Biden of the presidential list was examined.
«Maybe», Martin has replied.

From The Next Day, seemed in January, he has concocted a reissue of luxury foreseen for November 4th, with several unpublished.
Four have already emerged on the Canvas

A feast for his fans
Not weary of the surprises, David Bowie had more than one turn in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has thus planned to republish this album, on November 4th.
For the occasion he has concocted a true feast for his fans.

Of the unpublished ones already in listening
But Atomica is not the only title to unveil his charms.
The Informer, Like In Rocket Man, Born In HAS UFO are them also available on the canvas
The Informer belongs to copy-face: a worrying intro before a luminous stampede that slows down progressively to leave place to a ballad pop.
On Like In Rocket Man, has Bowie wanted to make the Rocket Man of Elton John, indeed even Gravity a small reference?
With this cheerful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when it does not have the feet anymore on earth
Space Oddity, nearby, was much more serious.
On Born In HAS UFO, David Bowie makes a new time reference to his strangeness: would it come from another planet?
The riffs of guitar, bewitching, give desire of leaving the Earth
Bowie enjoys itself playing at the chameleon with these titles in any case: in turn informer, man aboard a rocket, Martian potential...
It conceals and reveals at the same time, plays at adopting different personalities, as it has made it throughout his career notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Nothing of surprising to what it has therefore a mask by hand in the photograph of the campaign The Invitation to the Journey, of the brand Louis Vuitton, whose new face it incarnates.

Is the European elite ready to make businesses with Great Britain?
The Business campaign heart Britain has been thrown in April with the promise of gathering the firms and of defining it which the creators of riches and of jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
For it to make, we have ordered the inquiry the widest and the most complete next to the British leaders of firm and have asked to them for what they thought of the Great Britain, of the firms and of the EU.
YouGov has questioned more than 1 000 leaders of firm globalement representative of all the sizes of firms of the sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The conclusions of the inquiry will be a surprise for a lot.
We have discovered that the vast majority of firms try henceforth to export outside Europe, concentrating on the countries that are modernized and develop while the States of the EU stagnate.
They want to see the government rather give the priority to new commercial connections to countries as China, India and Brazil that of sinking into the long and arduous process of reform of the European institutional mysteries
While one asks them for their opinion on specific political points – going from the rules of the monopolies at the laws on the products – the majority of leaders of firm think that the control of these key abilities should return to the hands of Westminster.
The single market has occasioned a general dissatisfaction, the firms saying that the cost of the Brussels regulations is disproportioned in relation to the advantages that are to be part of the European zone of exchanges – 40 % of the great firms traditionally the most pro-European, are even agreed.
Finally, and what is more talking still, our inquiry next to the leaders of firm has revealed that an important majority wanted to see Great Britain hound the initiatives in favor of a change in the treaty and in the development with a relationship with the EU based on the business and not the policy
This conclusion, which meets itself in all the great groups and the firms of all sizes shows that the world of the firm insists for a «significant change» that returns the power in the United Kingdom.
The stakes are raised – to manage to change the treaty and better to represent the interests of Great Britain would allow of seeing a rocking movement of 16 % of the votes in favor of the maintenance of the country in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt only one instant: this inquiry shows that the British firms support this plan aiming at renegotiating the terms of the adhesion of Great Britain to the EU.
It shows that the firms expect from the power that the renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the present balance in favor of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom also.
It is possible, and more and more necessary, of better representing the interests of the British firms since the euro zone is engaged on the way of a narrower economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be the job and the growth in Great Britain and, as the conclusions of our inquiry show it for the firms that means to put again the accent on the business and a fundamental change in the statutory approach of Brussels.

But the Fund refuses to pour every new slice as long as the country will not have adopted reforms unpopular to reduce his deficit, increasing the prizes of the gas for the population notably.
At the End of a new unfruitful mission in the country, the IMF has noticed this week that "the important needs in exterior financing" constituted "a vulnerability" while raising "signs of economic improvement".
However, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud, from the Center of the political Studies, "one can not wait for an improvement in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms are thrown in a pre-electoral year", the presidential elections being foreseen in 2015, raises the expert, questioned to the AFP.
The only hope, it is an improvement of the international situation.
Moreover S&P raises the "uncertainty" related to the possible signature of an agreement of association between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions to the release of the opponent Ioulia Timochenko.
To "sign the agreement would be positive for the business in the long term but negative consequences could be to court and means terms related to the reaction of Russia", has explained S&P, who fears "commercial restrictions" on behalf of Moscow.
The Russia, which represents the quarter of the Ukrainian exportations, has warned that in the event of creation of a zone of free trade between the EU and Kiev, it should reinforce his controls at the border for the imported merchandise.
The pretors on security of Singapore profit of the middle classes forced to grip themselves the belt
At a pretor on security of the shopping center of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga puts down a bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings in gold to pay the expenses of schooling of his girls
«My husband and I have just bought a house therefore all my money has left inside», declares Mme Amirthalinga.
Although it earns 3 000 $ of Singapore (2 400 $) by month as administrator and that his husband also works, the monthly family income does not suffice, it says.
Actually, the request is such an in some parts of Southeast Asia – where the indebtedness of the households increases – that ValueMax, where she has carried out his transaction, has become this week the third society of loans on security to be introduced to the grant of Singapore.
To put jewels in security is not only a fast means of obtaining spot cash – 1 300 $ of Singapore in the case of Mme Amirthalinga – but it is nearly as a good market as the not guaranteed bank loans.
In general, the pretors on security of Singapore remove a real annual interest rate of 17 %, just above the 15.4 % ones offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local backer having a branch in the same shopping center.
However, the pretors on security have the advantage of not asking for verification of solvency or proof of salary, and can unblock the loans more rapidly than the banks.
Consequently, millions of people across the region turn to the pretors on security even though the families feel the pressure that exercises the increase of the cost of living and the excessive debt of the households and of the consumers.
After five years of solid growth from the financial world crisis, and the good credit market fed by a monetary policy too much lax in the advanced economics, the families to weak and average income turn to the pretors on security to fill in the difference even though their economics experience a slowing down.
This week, the agency of notation Switchboard & Poor's has quoted the increasing indebtedness of the households following from the rise of the hypothecary loans, as a factor of risk for the solvency of the Asian banks, principally.
She has declared that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the indebtedness ratio of the households domestic product the most raised of Asia.
Malaysia arrives in chief candidate with 80 % of the GDP, even though this rate rose to 60 % in 2008.
The economists fear also the high level of indebtedness of the consumers in Thailand, which is gone out of little this week of a technical recession.
Thursday, data have shown a weakness continues of the exportations and a slowing down of the request for the consumers.
«The assessment is that with the rise of the costs, the people in the middle or to the bottom [of the salary scale] try» to complete their incomes «as they can», declares Song Seng Wun, economist by CIMB, a bank malaisienne.
The prices historically put up of the gold in the course of the two last years have made that the people have hastened to put their personal effects in security to touch the value in cash of their jewels.
At Singapore, about 70 % of the articles put in security in the 200 stores of loan on security of the city-state are in gold.
The people say, «the price of the gold is raised, let's put in security the chain in gold of grandmother and one will come back to look for it next month».
In Thailand, the greatest operator of stores of loan on security, EasyMoney, has recorded a rise of 20 % of the number of customers using his stores in the course of the last months.
The rise is such an in the sector of the loan on security that ValueMax, operator of the store to Bendemeer and of 15 other stores as this in Singapore, plans to develop not only in the neighboring Malaysia – where he already counts four stores – but also outside Asia, declares Yeah Lee Ching, his general manager.
The society will finance them using 60 % of the 66 M$ of Singapore that it has raised this week during his introduction to the grant of Singapore.
While some pretors to reduced rate have dried the criticisms for the exorbitant interest rates that they practise, Miss Yeah indicates that the pawning offers not only of the rates less raised than the other pretors, but that besides it does not increase the debt directly.
«The customers mortgage goods that they already possess, and the fact of monetizing their personal goods does not increase the indebtedness of the households it says.
The pawning is of better in better accepted socially than means of obtaining a financing guaranteed in the short term.
Neither the people who go to the pretors on security are not those that have financial problems only.
The easy people of Singapore go also in the stores of loan on security ValueMax to put pawns ingots of gold or watches Rolex, which can represent up to 60 % of their purchase price in cash.
We see customers of all the coats of the society
«They can be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small firms that have needs of funds to pass a difficult cape», it adds Miss Yeah.
Sometimes, they just need money very rapidly.
The cocaine addict lawyer has been imprisoned that has informed a godfather of the drug of an inquiry of police
Basharat Ditta, 42 years, gave information to the lord of the crime Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to the drug is not revealed to the broad daylight
It has been sentenced to a grief of imprisonment of three years by the crown court of Liverpool
A great defense counsel, which had informed a godfather of the drug of an important inquiry of police because it was afraid that his secret addiction to the drug is not revealed, three years of prison has been sentenced.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years, gave sensitive information to the lord of the crime Neil Scarbrough regarding inquiries on his activities related to the drug traffic after s to be compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer which was nicknamed «Bash» and considered by the criminals as one« file of first importance», has been stopped at his place in 2011 subsequent to operations of listening of the police directed towards Scarborough, which it had represented during a previous trial in connection with the drug trafficking.
The officials of police have spotted Sarborough, 32 years, at putting down three bags of cocaine at the domicile of the lawyer at Blackburn, in the Lancashire, even though he attended a dinner of the Bar with colleagues.
The inquiries have revealed that Ditta was a «regular consumer» of this drug of class A after tests have shown traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards.
Towards a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he has tried to obtain information from illicit way on the arrest of two men for the account of Scarborough as one of his associates.
The four suspects were watched at that time by the police within the framework of an important inquiry on a traffic of heroine and of cocaine taking place in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, thereafter they have been imprisoned after the police have seized heroine and cocaine for an amount of 1.5 M£, as more than 200 000 lb in cash in the course of a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years, supplied information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction is revealed at the broad daylight.
Today, to the crown court of Liverpool, Ditta, that works in the office of lawyers Forbes Solicitors situated to Blackburn, has fallen in disgrace after having been pleaded guilty on two leaders of accusation of hindrance to the justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had admitted the possession of cocaine in the course of a previous audience.
The fall of the lawyer has occurred after the police, holding an inquiry on Scarborough, have discovered that it had been regularly telephonic in contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators have followed the suspect and have spotted it arriving to the domicile of Ditta and putting drug, pure to 60 %, under the garbage cans of the lawyer in a glove of black golf.
Little time after the deposit, Scarborough has been regularly telephonic in contact with Ditta that was at a dinner at the stadium of foot of Ewood Park, wall of the club of the Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer has returned to it has discovered the drug and they have phoned themselves to nine resumptions.
The court has understood that Ditta was a «regular consumer» of cocaine after tests have shown traces of this drug of class A in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards.
Ditta has been stopped later but he has denied to consume cocaine. He has declared that he had talked to the trafficker of drug presumed because it was his customer and has brought out that their discussions were subjected to a «legal privilege».
In the course of his arrest, Ditta has picked up his wallet and has tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they all have been seized and one has removed a sample of hair from it
During a cross-examination, he has declared that it possessed an office to his domicile, as to his workplace and that it happened that customers call it at his place for questions of legal order.
But the court has heard testimonies according to which he called major actors in the business of the drug, of which some that it had represented, after key arrests for their statement what investigators knew.
The prosecutor Anne Whyte has declared: «If somebody must know that the law must not be violated, he is well a penologist lawyer »
M. Ditta is a penologist, marked of having abused his position as lawyer and of being too much implied itself next to particular customers.
The relationship that we talk about is simply not a trafficker of drug, but a trafficker of drug supplying drug to his own lawyer
Some of his communications will be undoubtedly legitimate communications because it was his lawyer
But that has been fine beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his customer.
It has hindered the inquiry of the police as far as he has been able to allow him to pursue his criminal activities.
M. Ditta has not been an honor to his profession, but he has dishonored it
It has too much approached some customers, in particular Scarborough, and he has let his independence compromise.
Ditta has denied every illegal intrigue and has declared: If I was a corrupted lawyer what I am not, and if I had wanted to supply information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited for 15 hours, I would have made it immediately. »
But after the audience, the superbursar Lee Halstead de la Police of the Lancashire has declared: «Mr. Ditta has passed of penologist lawyer to criminal itself ever since that he has started obtaining drug next to criminal organizations. »
His addiction to the cocaine has compromised it forever and has made it vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the leading members of the organized criminal groups that have it responsible to obtain precious information regarding inquiries from police.
The lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and institute a climate in trust next to the public.
M. Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to shelter behind the varnish from his profession.
The unity loaded with the crime engraves and organized of the Lancashire has led the inquiry on Mr. Ditta, who has been pleaded guilty of the three leaders of accusation of possession of cocaine and maintaining of hindrance to the justice revealing his commitment to pursue the criminals in justice
That this business serves as warning for the criminals so that they know that nobody is above the law.
We will find you and will translate you in front of the courts.
Scarborough has itself been imprisoned for 14 years after having pleaded guilty of complicity of traffic of heroine, of cocaine and of cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in the traffic have been sentenced to a total of 153 years of prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta has organized a session of questions/replies on itself in the course of which he said that his job of dream would be of being lawyer to represent customers in the corridor of the death as America, her last dinner invited would be Mohammed Ali and the inequality would be what would motivate him to work.

A difficult year for the pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Center of health and social services (CSSS) of Laval has caused a whole emotion at the direction of the Hospital of the Cité-de-la-Santé, and it, during the year 2012-2013.
Because of numerous departures to the retirement of leaves of maternity or of departures everything runs, the department of drugstore has felt strongly poor in staff.
It lacked close to 30% the necessary staff, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the leader of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
Though, the CSSS has decided not to engage independent labor, which can cost until three times fullness dearer than a pharmacist engaged in time.
One has not had resort to the fixing, has explained Mme Beaudet.
One has rationalized or reduced some of our activities inside the establishment for landing, the time that the things are replaced.
It is sure about one having worked strong to interest our youths [residents in drugstore] so that they come and stay here.
There is a competition of circumstances that has made that one was the past year in a bad situation.
Improved situation
After this arduous period, the year 2013-2014 looks clearly easier for the department of drugstore of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to the work after their leave of maternity and three other pharmacists have been hired in the course of the last months.
Furthermore, the efforts deployed by the department in order to keep have carried fruits, because the four présentement students in residence to Laval have also decided to stay to the job of the CSSS.
Now, that goes much better, has underlined the pharmacist.
Of here the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three returns of maternity.
That will come therefore to fill in our departures with the past year.
Needs always croissants
The situation is though delicate.
Several factors as the shortage of pharmacists in hospital or a predominance of young women in the profession, give back such situations that that lived in 2012 difficult to foresee.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because one has an environment that is young and one uses many young women, therefore with the pregnancies, one rolls nearly always to three leaves of maternity when that is fine, it has added.
Last year, one has had much more and one does not have pharmacists who are available for making substitutions, therefore it was more difficult.

Anger caused by the grief pronounced contrary to one of the posers of bomb of Bali
The survivors and the close relations of the 202 people killed in the attacks of Bali in 2002 have reacted with anger to the grief pronounced contrary to the latter of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who has spent nearly 10 years in escape being one of the men most searched for of Southeast Asia, has been yesterday sentenced to a grief of 20 years of prison for his role in the fabrication of the explosive devices used during the attacks.
It could be freed at the end of 15 years under conditional release.
The man of 45 years has been pleaded guilty of killings of mass for the attacks aiming at two nightclubs in the touristic working class area of Kuta, which has caused the death of 202 people, of which 88 Australians, and have been numerous casualties.
It has also been pleaded guilty of numerous other leaders of accusation in connection with the terrorism, notably a wave of attacks aiming at churches in the whole Indonesia to the Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors have asked for a grief of imprisonment forever, nevertheless they would have been able to ask to what the man, described as «Demolition Man» for his reputation of expert in fabrication of bombs, is sentenced to death.
The decision has revived hard memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth that has lost his two twins of 39 years, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
At the edge of the tears, she has declared that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think that it should have followed the same path as the other men.
«It should be dragged in front of the firing squad», has declared Mme Corteen to the AAP.

M. Hugues has declared that Patek should have experienced the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – which were carried out 4 years ago.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
To keep it in life, why, there is not any reason of keeping it in life.
Spending 20 years in prison after having killed 202 people and hurt hundreds of others, it is not a lot.
Patek is the latter of the posers of bomb of Bali to be brought to justice.
It had succeeded in avoiding being made capture nearly for 10 years but finally has been stopped in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American strengths will kill the previous leader of Al-Qaïda, Oussama ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial an agent of the FBI has declared that relations of the services of information had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet ben Laden with the aim of restoring links between the terrorist groups of Southeast Asia and Al-Qaïda.
«He has not surrendered», has added Mme Corteen.
Up to lately, he laughed overwhelmingly at the sorrow that he had been able to talk to other people.
The verdict has been given back on the eve of the 10th birthday of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies at Bali and in Australia.
«Many tears will be this year», it Mme Corteen has said

But persons in charge of the information, of the army as of the activist subinfeudation have asserted this time that it had lost the life in this touch, taken to the region of the Nord-Waziristan.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud has been killed in a shooting of drone", has called a top responsible for the safety.

Mess around the closing of the urgency of the Hotel-God
Opposite the sling led since several months by a part of the staff and several unions, of which the CGT, the minister of the health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10th of "rescheduling the calendar of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closing of the urgency that will not be able to intervene on November 4th".
A request officially made not to run any risk on the responsibility of the urgency in Paris at the beginning of the winter but who aimed also at not bothering the campaign of the PS at some months of the municipal ones.
In spite of the ministerial orders, the closing should all the same be real at this date.
Even if, at the APHP, one prefers to use the term of "transformation" or of "change in the continuity".
As from November 4th, the pompiers that assured a quarter of the 40 000 annual passages to the urgency of the Hotel-God auront about everyone receipt for orders of carrying the thirty serious cases a day to the urgency of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4th corresponds also to the renewal of the boarding schools officers.
At the Hotel-God, the boarders specialized in urgency will leave place Monday to five boarders of general practice.
As for the transfer of the beds of internal medicine, it is programmed for the current of the month.
"The service of reception of the urgency of the Hotel-God must close in the briefest deadline, and for us, it is on November 4th", insures without bend Loïc Capron, the president of the medical commission of establishment (CME) of the APHP, which supports the project of the direction
"On November 4th, more patients taken by the firefighters, uniquely of the people coming by their average specificity will not be confirms the teacher Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical person in charge of the new Hotel-God.
"But we will continue receive patients in urgency", it tempers, bringing out the permanent presence of vehicles of the SMUR on site to transfer the serious cases.
Senior urgentistes doctors will stay on site, it assures also.
But it is to the ARS that deciding the closing of the service of reception of the urgency corresponds.
"The things make to themselves progressively", replies Nicolas Péju, spokesperson of the ARS for whom, on November 4th, change in terms will not be on duty exhausted."
"The minister has lain to us or one has lain to him laments the urgentiste doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his post of leader of the SMUR beginning July to have taken the sling against the project of reorganization, it defined itself as a "thrower of alert" in view of a decision "cynic" taken on by "the médico-administrative technostructure".
"Them are at emptying and of suffocating urgency that had been renovated less than five years ago, it values.
For it "if the other Parisian services of urgency could absorb the surplus, problem" would not be".
Yet they are regularly blocked.
There are for example nine hours of waiting to the urgency of Lariboisière sometimes.
To the ARS, one brings out that thirty patients "dispatched" on several sites do not risk to represent an "avalanche" in the other services of urgency, whose human means besides will have been reinforced.
At the ARS as to the APHP, one forbids 35 000 patients the "new hospital model" already set up since October 7th and who should continue receive 30 000 per annum.
Of here at the end of the year, liberal general practitioners also should come to participate in the arrangement of a "permanence of ambulatory care".
"Where one goes if one asks the people to self-diagnose themselves", questions itself Gérald Kierzek for whom "the concept of urgency not serious" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
That is going to happen as for the maternity of level 3.
The people are not mad, they are going to go there where there is the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take measure of here Monday, we are going to change gear ratio, warns Christophe Prudhomme, doctor urgentiste and member of the CGT Health.
We are going to be still more present within the framework of the municipal campaign and we are going to think to present a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, to recommend UMP of Paris and elected representative of the 4th district, announces clearly that "even if the Parisian UMP was urgency for the maintenance to the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if one comes back to the responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, has as for it again reminded Monday morning on France Inter that it had pronounced in favour of a moratorium so that closing is not on November 4th.
If it was the case, it would mark his net disagreement, underlines Bruno Julliard, his spokesperson.
Even if the restructuring of the Hotel-God has his legitimity on the bottom, we can not admit it without a satisfactory diagram of postponement to the other hospitals.

Gérard of Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
It will never have experienced the retirement word.
Phenomenon of the French edition Gérard of Villiers, died Thursday at 83 years, came very fair of publishing his 200th LOCK, "The Revenge of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times had hallowed it as "the author of spy thrillers who knew some too much".
He had just spent then ten days in Afghanistan, theater of the 198 and 199th opuses of the famous series of spy thrillers.
Reduced physically by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, it moved during this journey with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, it had also gone in Libya, in Russia, to Lebanon and to Mali again.
With four LOCKS published per annum, Gérard of Villiers, born on December 8th, 1929 in Paris, assured to ignore the exact number of books sold for 1965 and the publication of "LOCK to Istanbul", the first of the series, it is close to a half century.
"No doubt between 120 and 150 a million all countries mixed up", it advanced in March last.
His Myanma cat on the knees, in the lounge of his immense apartment of a building of the avenue Foch to two steps of the Arch of Triumph, the mischievous eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS have been translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the editions pirates", it added, referring to a stack of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or the ivories brought back of the 130 countries surveyed to situate his novels there.
For the price of a packet of cigarettes, the reader has right to the traditional blanket with the photo of a young woman at the worthwhile chest, carrying a pistol or a rifle of assault.
Inside, his sérénissime highness (LOCK) the prince Malko Linge, Austrian aristocrat left broke and contractual agent of the CIA to pay the repairings of the castle of family, launches to the cases of all the spiteful ones of the earth communists of the years 70 and 80, then jihadistes from the years 90.
At every book, the same recipe: a great dose of geopolitics and of exoticism, some hard scenes of sex, a zest of violence and of tortures.
"Never I have had the pretension of being a literary author", explained Gérard of Villiers.
I consider myself as a storyteller who writes to divert people to whom I do not send message.
He worked "as the great reporters of before war, of the type Albert Londres, who went on site and came back with true and long inquiries".
The father of LOCK said "to make a kind of serial geopolitical".
"I am permanently my files (Afghanistan, Syria...) before leaving", added Gérard of Villiers.
On site, I meet journalists, of which those of the AFP, of the diplomats, of the people of the services that I know for certain for twenty or thirty years.
An, as a result, number of his LOCKS are often premonitory: as thus, a month before the attack of a center of command of the Syrian system had killed several responsible tops, it had told the history in "The Path of Damascus".
In "The Madmen of Benghazi", it had been the first to reveal the existence of a center of secret command of the CIA in this city, cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he directed the murder of the Egyptian president Anouar El-Sadate in "The plot of Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", it related the columns of 4X4 of jihadistes that melted on the Malian capital.
I am not a seer, defended Gérard of Villiers, I make simply hypotheses from country that I know well and, from time to time, some of my hypotheses are realized.
After these journeys in often disturbed zones, he settled for a month behind his IBM typewriter at daisy dating back to 1976 "all the parts of which have been changed".
300 pages more late, it wrote the word "END" and corrected every page to the pen.
To the walls of his office are hooked of the rifles of assault AK-47, of the erotic photos and of the photos of the author with African lords of war.
Regularly pinned for male chauvinism by feminist leagues and for racism by organizations of the human rights, Gérard of Villiers removed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sex objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and brave women.
I am well received always in Africa where I count very numerous readers.
Gérard of Villiers had said it: "Malko Linge, as all the heroes, does not have age".
He will not die and will not leave in retirement
Not more that me.
