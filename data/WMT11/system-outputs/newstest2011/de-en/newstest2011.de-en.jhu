What it should do, the čssd? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither voldemort, nor the "konditorei."
The new ratsherren the capital from the ranks of the čssd will obviously certain barriers have to overcome their alt-neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and the stadtvertretung able to understand at all.
The newspaper aktuálně.cz, members of the new Council from the čssd time "a little abgeklopft," as the notorious slang dominate, which in the past few years has established, in which the current coalition partner in Prague were at the helm.
The codierte wortschatz in the verflossenen era of Mayor Pavel bém political elite was introduced by the Prague is some of the best known players, situations and causae entlehnt.
Surprisingly showed that the new councils in relation to these new concepts of something in the dark.
They say that at least.
"Who is voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am more of a neuling responded in the Prague Policy," lukáš kaucký, the new ratsherr on Culture, "to the test of the paten-wortschatzes."
But also the ratsherr Karel březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way.
For example to the concept of "golfloch."
"This is the only expression of which I present here that I use now and again."
"Otherwise, I do not think much of slang."
From the wortschatz the tageblatt aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the wahlkongress had published the ODS, pickte the redaktion out six terms, especially those who are notoriously with the Prague magistrat are linked.
The Social Democrats, the concepts of "voldemort," "the greatest Prague golfloch," "in the konditorei go," "stiernacken," "define" and "verblechen" betrayal of the capital.
Three Prague ratsherren voted to the test, the fourth - Mr weinert, the future head of Prague schulwesens - promised first of its participation in the conversation, then took the but not the time hörer from.
The fifth ratsherr, Petr dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"These things are no matter to me and how the Civic Democrats to talk to each other, I do not make about it."
"What is important to me, as we understand within the framework of our programmes," he countered.
As has been suggested, would have lukáš kaucký allegedly in the abovementioned headline not recognised that entrepreneurs from the influential and friend of the ex-oberbürgermeisters bém, Roman janoušek is said.
The term "voldemort" says kaucky nothing AND THE ONLY concept he correctly in the test erriet, was "the greatest Prague golfloch."
"This is the tunnel blanka," says kaucký, added to safety, but added: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I will be a sprachkurs must show."
The "golfloch" will then not only by matador Karel březina, but also by the ratsherrn on the environment lukáš plachý right as a tunnel blanka entziffert.
But both Social Democrats know for whom the term voldemort, and is lukáš plachý even knows where to find this figure, and this is what it means," in the konditorei to go."
"I believe, that is to say, in any Prague gastronomiebetrieb to go," is plachý quite close to the rätsels solution, if you know that it is the seat of janoušeks firms is concerned.
In line with březina but he claimed to have this knowledge more as a result of the newspaper, as that him this wortschatz would be adopted.
The testteilnehmern suggest that, it seems under the Social Democrats, in fact, no similar eingebürgerten slang to give in.
"I have asked my colleagues, but obviously there is such a thing really not with us."
"We call on the name, from time to time we use words or spitznamen," says the chairman of the Prague čssd Petr hulínský - from his parteigenossen casual called "hulda."
"I was in the school bříza - birke - mentioned, but I do not know whether my colleagues call me," tells us Karel březina his spitznamen.
The newspaper deník aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see there, he works.
Ratsherr weinert is for the parteigenossen kind of "opa" or less kind of "old," the representative of Mirek poche before the elections by activity in the partei-sponsoring on pointed out, will "by some Members igráček '- known Czech lego-figur - mentioned.
Spitznamen are so the only thing that the Social Democrats in whose allow use of language.
Hulínský supposedly, it may not if it is called "hulda," but deník aktuálně.cz registered another spitznamen the chairman of Prague.
Be spitzname "Dr of gummiknüppel-rechte" was supposed to do that Petr hulínský his title doctor Juris in the bratislaver Police College has acquired.
The government wants to stop the torture of "hexen" and issued a leaflet
Women in Burkina Faso to hexen be labelled point in some common social characteristics in the rule.
They belong to more of the older generation, they find no work, for example, for health reasons, they are ledig and have no children.
If any of these women to hexe "Will" it will strictly isolated so that they cannot be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are rarely affected by this fate right."
"Young and healthy women also remains spared this, as they help with the work and bear children," a ordensschwester describes the situation in the capital of the West African country Burkina Faso in a spezialheim takes care of more than 100 women, which were rejected by their communities.
The ortsregierung decided now to act against these abnormal 'sozialmaßnahme."
And issued a brochure for this reason, is to stop the "hexenverfolgung."
But the matter has a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,," the newspaper "derstandard" out of the dilemma of the written information.
The hexerei accused to be but is also commonplace in other African countries.
In the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, Ghana, was the 27-jährige ammy hemmahová tortured to death of three women and two men, they übergossen them with petroleum and burned it simply.
On this incident reported including the BBC server.
The alleged perpetrators, however, the matter would have been only a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version is oil inflamed, the ritual of salbungen will be used.
And, after the group tried to "an evil spirit" "from the woman's good health."
The isolation of "hexen" Support the people here without regard to their education.
"The standard," it quoted a 42-jährigen entrepreneurs from Burkina Faso: "fresserinnen human souls are used as a threat today," he said.
While the government at least in Burkina Faso tried to defuse the witch hunt, the gambianische President last year the president himself properly mitgemischt.
"President yahya jammeh launch after the death of his aunt a monstrous witch hunt, as these supposed to have had a share of their death and would now try to kill the president even by black magic."
"To do so, he called schamane from the middle of Guinea to help the soldiers accompanied by police officers, and of the President leibgarde indiscriminately festgenommene men and women by force from gambianischen villages and abducted to the President's farm in kanilai brought" led the organisation in its report to Amnesty International.
On the farm have been forced to the people eingekerkerten a absud from plants with halluzinogener effect to drink, but also darm- and nierenprobleme Federal Reserve.
Two of the arretierten people survived the residence on the farm.
Only because of the international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of bakala: he fuels in the foot - still pay higher miete
An older untersetzter man leaves just the klientenzentrum society rpg byty of "kohlebarons" zdeněk bakala, the largest privatbesitzers of mietwohnungen in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm of a mappe with three new mietverträgen on three homes, for its own and the homes of his daughters and his son, just a sentence.
All three have been within the framework of the sog. "deregulation" is the miete increased.
Instead of 3 500 kronor monatsmiete is the son of the next year for a 2-zimmer-wohnung with kitchen of the second category 4100 kronor berappen.
"And there is not a time in the home of hot water and heating must be in a simple kohleofen," for he is angry with the finger on the new mietvertrag of the Son, to which he signed a power.
"But what - property I signed," he says annoys half and half resignedly.
's citizens' association bytyokd.cz, the new mietbedingungen referred to as "immoral" by and advises the mietern, is simply not to sign new contracts and to wait until the seventh of December, in which it intends to publish a guidance as to how to take action against such contracts.
But only from the man to win.
"A says, that" the other, this makes it a finsteres face.
The region ostrava will go to a large "deregulierungslabor."
After neujahr this deregulation is the most mietwohnungen before in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not marktgerechte miete figures.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" personally.
The rpg-warteraum in havířov is one of four in the region ostrava and already nine a.m. in this Tuesday brechend full.
Start in addition to the door, the bodyguards a sicherheitsagentur and with it a aufrufgerät.
"miete in 2011," is a special tastfeld on the touchscreen.
Briefly angetippt and already spuckt the machine, a nummernzettel.
We have hardly the number "157" entziffert and already piepst it on display at the ceiling of the great warteraums.
Half a second later, one in the series.
A little later enters an older married couple the warteraum to after the miete to questions, but the arrival of the warteraum is obviously not the new miete.
Most of the people are here to solve the usual problems, reparaturanträge, versicherungsangelegenheiten and so on.
As of the middle of November flattern in the region ostrava the kuverts with the new mietverträgen most of the mietern out of a total of 44.000 homes of the portfolios of the rpg in the scenario.
The rpg byty proposes them in the letter, a mieterhöhung of around 15 to 38 percent.
The Special counters for the new rent in the klientenzentrum has opened since 18 November.
"The action is something about a week, that is, this is only the beginning," answers the ladies behind the counter at hesitate after a moment, when the "client" emerging as a journalist.
The deregulation and bakalas former bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue.
Before the elections, the from ostrava originating deputy speaker he lubomír zaorálek by the čssd addressed this issue quite loudly, it is no wonder that today, the newspapers are full of them.
"Twenty years I want a new floor of them."
"Not even ne besch. wc-brille they could auswechseln" Air makes the man mentioned at the beginning.
Until now, according to the working, especially the switch of pensioners, in order to see whether they the promised mietermäßigung really that they have rpg promises if they spezialangebot sign on time.
In the benefit of a reduced to half februarmiete come to the other tenants, the new mietvertrag sign until 15 December.
Until now," deregulierungsschalter "in havířov but everything other than overloaded by demand.
"Yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the miete in 2011 because here," We appreciate very much the schalterbeamtinnen.
Rpg it offers both on their websites and wandtafeln individual mietvereinbarungen, where it seems necessary.
Should the mietparteien but not agree on the new miete, they will set by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but as information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach to understand," said rpg on its Web sites.
"No one goes to court in this area," says one of the working of rpg byty and a man in the street before the klientenzentrum gives it at least partly right.
"I have 13 - SEK - Pension, of which remain me 5,000 to eating left where I should find the money for a gerichtsstreit," he says.
Then the employees but is uncertain.
"See time."
"Mr zaorálek tells them about the media, they are not sign and so the people still wait from," is to consider it.
The regulated miete ends in the largest part of Czech neujahr 2011 and rpg byty is, according to the mieterhöhung an economic necessity.
"The existing level of the rent is not enough time to the maintenance of the wohnfonds from," argued Pavel klimeš, the director of the wohnungs-portfolios society rpg byty and - particularly the exasperated mietern criticised neglect of wohnungsfonds is, in the opinion of homeowners, the main reason for the mieterhöhung.
During rpg rent in the years between 2005 and 2010 collected from the four billion could invest in the homes, in the four years from 2011 until 2014, there should be 5.2 billion.
On the großformatigen lcd-display to the ceiling to the polstersesseln in warteraum of havířov, then again and again a few red shining on information.
"The mieterhöhungen by 15% in 2011 and less concern 31 200 homes, that is more than 90% of the homes of rpg."
"Always This means no more than 7,50 czk per square metre and month," is on the lcd-monitor to read.
Only 400 homes in from the portfolio of rpg increased the miete at 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about the increase of extremely small mietpreise of 19,66 czk per square metre," argued rpg.
In 2600 homes remains the miete at the same level in the next year.
Rpg byty promises that the deregulation of the Rent is not jumped in the level, but gradually take place within four and eight years.
What is more, the company on a further commitment: all of the revenue from the mieterhöhung - see diagramm - the company wants to get stuck in the homes, especially in wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and the wärmedämmung.
But - primarily benefit those people to this, the agreements on the mieterhöhung sign.
The architects saw a - the Office is also a kindergarten
The bürogebäude avriopoint in brno is the new headquarters of the company arch.design.
But who would have been a minikindergarten expect, with all that implies, farbenfrohen walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a minispielplatz on the außenterrasse.
The kindergarten has since last year, the staff of arch.design available.
The projektierungs- and architekturbüro arch.design, from its ateliers a number of prominent brünner buildings are expected from the first drafts for the new building avriopoint to with the premises for his firmen-minikindergarten.
Wise in, because the majority of 90 of its staff - within - the babyboom-alter and the company is keen that the projektantinnen and architektinnen return to their work as soon as possible.
Is reduced to work, together with the possibility of a further bonus, the kindergarten arch.design its employees in the concept of its sozialprogrammes has to offer.
The bauingenieurinnen and -architektinnen have it so easily, demanding their profession and the kinderfürsorge to bring under one roof.
The minikindergarten is an original idea of staff - within - of arch.design and with the support of the management, you can of the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs for its project to win.
The occupational minikindergarten by means of the operationsprogramm Human Resources and employment policy from the resources of the European Social Fund and from the staatsbudget financed the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding - grants to the tune of 2.8 million czk - could be obtained the necessary facilities and the equipment and for the duration of 2 years for qualified personnel and provides for the operation.
After the exhaustion of the aid - 2 years - is the arch.design society to the minikindergarten 3 more years to continue to pursue their own costs.
The preparation of this project took a whole year in right, and the economy rating society in antragsabwicklung active assistance provided.
To care for the children ganztätig qualified personnel, a nurse and a kindergartenlehrerin, able to kindergarten children without altersmäßige visit restrictions, even though the majority of them are over three years old.
And because it is a mini-kindergarten, must be present only 5 children at the same time, however, change the day on several children from each other.
The kindergartenbetrieb is flexible to the need of the parents of the children of all staff have voted in relation to the use of the kindergartens the same rights, without regard to the firmenhierarchie and their respective positions.
Although it is individual education and care is the programminhalt in mini-kindergarten yet comparable with the framework of the vorschulbildung.
Will play not only here, especially the children of basic knowledge you offered excellent education, up to and including the vorschulunterricht, by the way you also learn English.
The classroom is not only with toys and creative play, but also equipped with a computer, which is available to the children.
What is more, the presence of young children in the company is contributing to a friendly and positive firmenmilieu.
The parents can always take a look at the children and so is the stress of the late to collect the children from a distant kindergarten.
Therefore the parents use their productive working hours.
It is no wonder that is also natural and loyal arbeitgeber-arbeitnehmer-beziehungen are emerging.
Arch.design reihte so under the Czech companies to offer the clear benefits in the recruitment of new staff, the familienfreundlich and by such programmes of their personal- marketing support.
A knochenhaus fascinated even after 100 years. look at the interieure of gaudi to
The roof is how to the back of a prähistorischen echse, the steps, such as the vertebral column of dinosauriers and the balkone are aufgerissene fischmäuler.
This is the Casa batlló of Catalan architect Antonio gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants got the house with its organic forms the spitznamen "knochenhaus."
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, kachelsplittern and mosaiks in just erinnernde fassaden and ubiquitous soft lines, all of this is a common feature for the jugendstil by Antonio gaudi.
The facade of the house is playing with beautiful lines, zärtlichen paints and texturen in nature and remind creatures.
Only on closer inspection, they noted that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
In the night, the whole front or plastic, dramatic and the special anleuchtung enhances the glamour of the colours.
The same schwungvollen lines and tortuous forms dominate the home of the House.
Wellenartig geformtes wood copied the fensterrahmen, geländer, zierelemente of doors, even gucklöcher and afford.
The House batlló in the eixample quarter in the crowded einkaufsstraße passeig de grácia No 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from the years 1877, the architects emilio sala cortese said.
Use of the reconstruction, two years and was 1906 concluded.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep batlló was originally in the abriss of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately it voted the idea gaudís on an unusual and cheaper to reconstruction.
The mietshaus Casa batlló outlined antoni gaudí, however, not alone.
He worked with the architects Josep Maria jujol together.
Just on its reißbrett created the dekorationen representative for the home of the realitätenbesitzers and the use of mosaiken part of the facade was his idea.
Working on the design of the facade, but also many other bildner and artists.
The joint work on the drafts for the Casa batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of jujola and gaudí.
So is involved jujol the construction of gaudís House Casa milá in the güell Park, in which other works of antoni gaudí are.
Already shortly after its completion, the house of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the spitznamen "knochenhaus."
Others called it the specific fensteröffnungsmechanismus yawning due to the "house."
It also says that the sword is at the top of the building of the Saint George, the patrons presented by Catalonia.
But other bildhauerische elements symbolise hidden religious motives.
Gaudí outlined for the house of a unique for that time zentralheizungssystem with entlüftungskanälen and typical kaminen.
Something seems bizarre their 45-grad-neigung already.
During his create ignored gaudí consistent all then bauvorschriften and did not be led astray by this.
Before baubeginn "he from the town of the relevant baugenehmigung but the claims made by him on the planned reconstruction was so vague that the stadtväter two years later in the completion of so that they demanded a remedy were horrified by the outcome.
The ratsherren met with, among other things, that the building with its pillars, even in the public pavement intervention.
To change, but not more, quite the contrary, only fifteen days after the request in this regard, the stadtviertels, Josep batlló a request for approval of the vermietung of the two höchstgelegenen stockwerke of the House, and it has been granted him promptly.
The Homeowners themselves, in the lower floors.
In the gallery in the second floor was a gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were the bedroom and the home privaträume.
The erdgeschoss has been sent to a juweliergeschäft verpachtet.
The whole sechsstöckige buildings is going through a steps by up to dachterrasse.
By the main elements of the umbaus all right corner and on lines were removed and by gebogene and geschwungene replaced walls.
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach for mutual link of spaces.
The social part is by the opening of the salontüren completely link and a larger society was convenient plaudern without in vertraulicheren have to abandon talks on a certain amount intimität.
The House received by gaudís reconstruction out of a new front a very unusual roof and two other stockwerke.
A is also gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasierten kacheln with which the courtyard is dressed and the lichthöfe.
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
This made it is the principle to take that knows better reflect the light, as dark colours, the sunlight on the contrary to absorb.
The House of Casa batlló that 2005 was included in the UNESCO welterbe-liste can visit today everybody.
In the first floor of the geräumigste and prächtigste home made available to the public.
The Homeowners determined only in years to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150.geburtstags of the famous creator.
When it said that this is a very profitable business, it maintained the besichtigungen in, yes you are extended to other common and the dachgeschossräume, including the dachterrasse.
The price to besichtigung of baudenkmals, however, is not a pittance, he is 16,50 euro, students, pensioners, groups and holders of touristenausweisen get 20 percent reduction.
This amount exceeds the eintrittspreise to other gaudí-bauten in the city.
Who is the real atmosphere of the house with its drachentürmchen would like to learn about friendship should try with one of the hausbewohner to close and visit him at home.
The right matratze and the right bettenrost? women than men have other wish
Not the tollste bettrahmen, but the quality of the liegefläche - matratze and rost make up the good bed.
This, however, must add harmoniously in order to live up to the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection process, the weight of the size of the health and, not least, the sex of the schläfers.
Just as important is also the interieur in which matratze and rost to have.
Typical example?
In a wochenendhaus, which will not be heated regularly are latexmatratzen not good, as they need much longer in order "to be warm."
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethan-matratzen.
And, they should be changed regularly.
If they are not enough entlüftungskanälchen in essence and to lie on a firm plate, staut in moisture, so it is not excluded that is built on it.
In the election plays a role of course, to what it is used.
Anyone who has been in a long time abroad, where very high matratzen with weichschicht are common, will be difficult to a low matratze can be used with hard surface.
"Probably all eishockeyspieler from the nhl have returned, have complained to me that they cannot sleep more right here."
"for their abgeschundenen shoulders, fersen and hüften they just need a weichschicht from visco-schaum - memory foam - a formgedächtnis-polymer -."
"I recommend that among other things, diabetics people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so they have the" information "from the gelenken and skin can receive a bad thing," says Sylva hadamcziková to polstermöbel specific.
That is why I have been to many years ago eishockeyspielern, but also other customers this matratzen with visco-schaum - memory foam - worried.
"Today, it is no longer a problem, because such matratzen offer including the manufacturers tempur, the Italian company magniflex or the Czech producers tropico."
And we must not necessarily be a famous eishockeyspieler to the benefits of the visco-schaums estimate to learn.
This "miracle" works really quite simple.
The foam optimalisiert its severity and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt there is a real the warm body.
It is nowhere in the night shifts are not around as after a major fight.
We sleep simply much better.
The viskoelastische foam also provides protection against dekubitus - wundbrand -.
In the election of the matratzengröße should still be at the height of the length of the fußsohlen hinzurechnen, about 21 cm to 34.
Man as Mrs, which are the 180 cm high, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the schläfer should at least 90 cm liegebreite available, together so 180 cm.
In einzelbetten, for example, in singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate.
The komforts to be half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following faustregel lies on the backs of the bettbreite ideals," If you should still be enough room for the easy angewinkelten be poor," advises ing. helena prokopová, the zunftmeisterin the polsterer and raumausstatter, which has been for years the problems of common schlafes and the ergonomie devotes furniture and this issue was also at the university.
In a doppelbett needs each with its own rost and his own matratze, but be careful the purchase, so that the matratzen are high in a moment.
Otherwise, do nothing other than the roste to fit in a different level and that is not a long time ago with each bettrahmen possible.
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, matratzen with federskelett 15 cm, it should have at least three centimeters on the formschicht and the feinpolster disappear.
"With the hand or to sit down the feathers in no case can be felt," warns helena prokopová.
Any matratze makes a special rosttyp required.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with matratze and documents as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom.
This matratzen cannot to reveal and the relation cannot be washing what is already started today and were.
And as you in a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the matratze slowly after five to seven years to a huge - and congested colander -.
Are therefore experts werbeslogans from in matratzen a lifespan of up to 25 years, even life guarantee promise.
Every thing has its if and but.
And that is why a practical advice from the dealers: in matratzen of 120 or 140 cm wide should be the hygiene of waschbaren, abziehbaren salary not shy away from, nonetheless, it is recommended that a matratzenschoner to use that you can easily withdraw and wash.
Even if today in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss are produced, so you get two halves after the open - immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße! - is the manipulation with greater matratzen alone said, in particular, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
They have in bed instead of a rostes a firm plate?
Out of it.
Or at most for a bed for Cinderella guests and for a single night.
So should they prefer the plate with lüftungslöchern oversight - if already are not in it - and matratzen with federskelett and 15 cm minimum allocation with sog. taschenfederkern and feinpolster use.
Polyurethan-matratzen do not belong to such a documents.
For not verstellbare lattenroste with 14 to 18 federleisten - lamellen - are latex- or sandwichmatratzen suited - perhaps also combinations of latex and kokos - is always pay roste with a greater lattenanzahl, 28, and more federleisten, with lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich, and the possibility of the lattenhärte to regulate.
On verstellbare lamellenroste are not matratzen with federskelett, because they do not respond to the ergonomische verstellung respond.
In addition to the stiff attitude of the federleisten will also be specific flexible schultermodule required.
We are talking about a specific Gaza of the federleisten, which will make it possible to implement the federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln that the specific einsinken shoulder the schläfers possible.
Especially for men with broad shoulders of an important matter.
There is even matratzenhersteller which have started," herrenmatratzen "weichzonen for the schulterbereich to use.
Also is thought to the ladies - you gönnt you this weichzonen in the hüftgegend.
For demanding customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme - lattoflex - or roste with punktelastischen kontakt-pads with sog. multitorsionsfederung determined.
The pressure will be distributed on a number of points, which reduced the tension.
But, if you have the right matratze and right rost a bad - too much and fülliges - kopfkissen used to go again lost most of the benefits.
Here, too, faustregel: the kopfkissen should support the head of its leaders should only to the rich shoulders, so that the schultermuskeln can relax.
Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm great kissen How, for example, it may be the Scandinavians.
In the seitenlage should the kopfkissen - together with the schulterentlastungszone in rost or the weichzone in the matratze - the schulterhöhe balance.
Have something our modern matratzen have with the former - with Hay so - strohsäcken but in common.
Modern producers increasingly use natural materials, or at least the mixtures.
Also in matratzen is the new magic formula "organic."
Instead of erdölrohstoffen be used to produce polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils, for example, rizinus- and sojaöl.
Soya is likely to be used by all known manufacturers.
"Organic means in matratzen that their core from materials is purely natural origin," said Petr vašíček of the company tropico plus.
Naturstoffe but also in the production of matratzenbezügen used, one of the first was in the process of aloe Vera.
But it can also mikrokapseln introduction of the sleep fresh wald- or lavendelduft spread.
Here, too, there is a difference between men and women.
During a "kühlender" in the men pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern is used, so that the matratzenbezug can absorb the heat and cooling the body, the salary for women "wärmende" effect.
Extrakte from red paprikaschoten stimulate the blutzirkulation to the weaker sex, so the sleep wohlig warm.
And the favoriten today?
Matratzen from kaltschaum - he has more poren with devastated zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver as a standard polyurethan and much more flexible -.
Through the combination of various stiff - tough - of kaltschäumen and visco-schäumen arise mehr-zonen-matratzen who know exactly where head, hip and fersen are.
For a quality matratze but it has 7000 kronor and more to berappen.
Gesundheitsmatratzen but usually are burdened with lower VAT, as they apply as medical tools.
The first Czech companies have been gumotex given this advantage.
You see in the matratze and on rost is not so easy to save.
Now and again, there are sonderangebote of producers and traders, the two matratzen offer for the price of one.
The magniflex brand offers the matratze duofreeze with in terms of verstepptem visco-schaum memory for 11.990 czk.
The second will be free to do so.
It was the material tempur the era of the viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem launched pace.
No surprise, they were developed but for the NASA, because the astronauts are huge in the launch überbelastungen suspended.
Tempur is soft, with heat in a cool setting it strengthens again.
So it is perfect to the human body, and distributed in the best possible manner körperdruck.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent druckbrand, but generally increase the schlafkomfort.
Viskoelastische schaumstoffe but not only in matratzen, but also in other gesundheitsprodukten, such as, for example, in particular fußpolstern used to give the legs and the gefäßen relief.

More and more parents want to menschen-überwachungsgeräte, in order to have the kids under control
The growing fear for their own children and consider more and more parents to monitor them by GPs.
The system, which originally to fahndung was invented for cars can as well people places, which would be helpful in such cases, as recently as the spurlosen disappearance of the neunjährigen anička janatková.
The machine is currently about as big as a zigarettenschachtel but soon it should not be greater than a armbanduhr.
Many people, the case of the missing anička puts in fear and terror and you keep looking for means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of a lower their privacy.
"We try to say to all of us, that it is not in any way herumspionieren, it is an effective means to reduce the likelihood that the tragedy is," leads Petr pilin by the society macro because of one of the suppliers of gps-ortungsgeräten on the Czech market.
"I accept that it can come to the abuse of such equipment in individual cases, for example, if there is someone in the pocket without that he knows it, but so far we have had no such case has been made."
"Most of the customers buy it really for security reasons," adds pilin added.
In his opinion, but the child should always know what purpose the "kind would" serves and as they are used in an emergency.
The kinderpsychologin dana bočková but points out that a child, if it may not bear such a thing, it got rid of his simply.
"very small children show great creativity, when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled."
"The mobile phones set initially at the parents of great expectations, but you can just as easily switch off as these new überwachungsgeräte," says woman bočková.
In your opinion is also controversial whether such an institution in the event of an attack really helps.
"in planned kidnappings controlled the kidnapper virtually always whether any electronics of the child, with which it could be located."
"Today it is the mobile phone."
"If such überwachungsgeräte for broader use, they would also seek them because their sale would be certainly accompanied by massive advertising."
"in these cases are always a step ahead of the criminals of the police," says the psychologist.
But it gives a that similar equipment in a sudden attack by a paedophile well can be helpful.
Roberta čech monitoring of the RC society, according to the ortungsdienstleistungen both for cars and for offering people, can the existence of such a gerätes will also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The machine is actually stop so that the respective positions in certain intervals reports it."
"Even if it would immediately destroyed, is at least the last position at the disposal of the concerned person."
"in more expensive equipment is even a neigungsmesser integrated, that is, if you hinfällt and bewegungslos are remains a warning immediately, sends the machine under the claim of the position," said Mr čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also Do Smart mobile phones with navigation, you only have a special software einzuspielen.
The problem of the current ortungsgeräte is that it is either about equipment in streichholzschachtel-größe is like the supporters or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk that we lose it.
Mr pilin by the macro because according to testing equipment that we therefore in the present as normal digitaluhren look like.
"The attacker has the advantage that the possible at all must not see that it is a monitoring or ortungsgerät is.
"Or he can see that only after a certain time, what the police a zeitvorsprung are added," he adds.
No matter in the direction of the development - towards armbändern or supporters, always will be the same technology is used, as with the fahrzeugortung.
So for the combination of ortungsfunktion with the gps-systems - as well as the navi in the car - and the role of a mobile phone for the current position of the reports.
The army has so many zündschnüre that the whole of the Czech Republic umwickeln could keep it but only two years
The Czech army has 445 kilometres zündschnüre shopped, with sprengsätze catch.
In the year before, the Defense Ministry has already been 224 km zündschnur to the armeelager supplied.
It is already reassuring to know that the Armed Forces for 225 years ausgesorgt.
The problem is only the span of zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the zündschnüre by the company stv group, a. s. for läppische 40 million kronor.
In his justification for the procurement of this huge amount zündschnur said the General Staff issued mf dnes, the soldiers would annually to the 60 kilometres zündschnur use.
The research of armeepyrotechnikern according to mf dnes raised point is clear from this indication that the whole army would have to be an extremely intense pyrotechnic training every year, of all the generals and officers of the armeekommandos, right up to the secretaries and putzfrauen.
Defense Minister alexandr Vondra and army general vlastimil picek not excluded.
Only in this way could be the significant annual consumption of 60 kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justified.
This length calls for 25,000 detonationen.
But this would armeebestände rich for more than 10 years.
But if the old rule of experts is that the training of each new military professionals two metres zündschnur quite sufficient, then the Army through the neueinkäufe, also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pionier- and special units - created a reassuring stock for the 225 years already mentioned.
Complained the soldiers of the schnelleinsatzbrigade recently at the Defense Minister Vondra, they had almost no patronen more for small arms, so schießübungen due to the lack of funds are severely restricted.
The unterhosenmangel not to remain silent.
"To me is also not a why such quantities of US zündschnüre buy."
But that is their decision at the end of the day, they will have to know what they need to."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we want to come as traders to a large extent," says the vertriebsmanager the stv group Jan děcký.
Jan pejšek, the Defense Department spokesman justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres zündschnur so that the Army would have so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" eingedeckt.
Jan děcký speaks of the stv group but only by a four gebrauchsdauer the zündschnüre and police and armeepyrotechniker even just two years ago.
"with perfect storage are probably the four years mentioned possible," one of them, but ungenannt wants to remain in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the end of the gebrauchsdauer any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
But these tests are not in vain, but cost more money.
Another argument of the defense department is the mengenrabatt for the 445 kilometres zündschnur.
"It cost us sixty percent less than the last year's supply of 244 kilometres," tells us spokesman pejšek the position of the einkäufer with the Defense Department.
Only for comparison, the annual consumption of zündschnüren of the police, the ammunition in the Second World War pyrotechnikern or withdraw the Soviet bruderarmee, exceeds hardly 1,500 metres for quite a few years.
Appointed and the police are only such quantities of these weapons, which it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can use.
The security of the pyrotechniker because of, there is also the possibility to flexible purchases more advanced and therefore reliable zündschnüre open.
The Defense Ministry has already huge problems in the liquidation tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw treaty, when the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak People's Army prepared to their campaign on the Rhine.
The pyrotechnikern according to mf dnes raised expected in a few years, the Czech armed forces have the same problem in the liquidierung hundreds of kilometres of age zündschnüre has bought today as "good."
Come until now I want the contacts, which I have won thanks to the competition
The victorious platzierung in competition "small entrepreneurs of the Year" lukáš pytloun helped in the sale of the franchise of his hotel.
Winners of the last jahrganges of competition was "small entrepreneurs of the Year" lukáš pytloun from liberec.
The history of its success is like a filmszenarium.
Lukáš pytloun went to.
Only abroad he was aware that it is in liberec in good übernachtungsmöglichkeiten lacking at reasonable prices.
From the savings from its ferienarbeiten abroad and through a bankkredits erstand he a baufälliges house with five homes.
Given that he was hochschulstudent in the sixth semester this was certainly a daunting.
"The former preis-qualität-verhältnis angered me and so I tried to do something about it," says lukáš pytloun.
The first rekonstruierte apartment he rented to auslandsarbeiter.
The whole profit he immediately invested back into the house, which he then step by step to pension beds with 54 umbaute.
Since then it managed only seven years in business activity in liberec four pensions, two stilgerechte restaurants and two hotels with a gesamtkapazität of more than 300 beds of all unterkunftskategorien to open.
The komfortabelste of them was until recently the viersternehotel "pytloun design hotel."
This year, another first hotel added.
"We have just a contract with a hotel in ostrov U tisé signed and other interested parties, which we have sold franchise-konzept franchise on the pytloun-hotels have already registered," says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
"large share of this lizenzverkauf to pursue hotels had just the victory in competition" businessmen of the year, "adds Mr pytloun appreciation added.
The victory has him greater bekanntheit, yes popularity in liberec tabled and environment.
"The people have recognized me on the street, often congratulated me even subsequently and I must say that it did really well," he recalled.
I really commend all who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You also need not equal to win any sichtbarmachung is good.
He says that he will use until today from the contacts and acquaintances, to which it otherwise would not come at all.
"with some people I have met thanks to the competition, I hold regular business contacts until today."
The glory associated with the success is down his opinion after a little on each of its staff.
And because he has to the seventy.
"I see in them greater loyalty and proud of the fact that they are a part of something, will be given to the universal recognition."
I really see this not only as a personal success, no, it is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is only something Come to the fore," says lukáš pytloun modest.
I wish my successors to a ruhigeres year than we had in farmet
The siegeseuphorie was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination has farmet behind the worst.
The price of the first rank of competition vodafone company of the year last jahrgang, Karel žďárský, the firmeninhaber of farmet against.
The jury paid tribute to the efforts at the time, with which he from the small werkzeugbau in česká skalice improvised parliamentary from the ground, a company that makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this tribute, not only myself but also encouraged all of my staff and our confidence has encouraged with the competition in the fight," says the vorjahresgewinner.
At the start of the firmengeschichte of farmet was an effort to do something useful.
And Karel than his father then the state žďárský as a compensation for the property confiscated by the communists a small werkstatt offered to lease, he did not last long, left his career in the company, in which he was employed by then, ditch and formed their own company with a few of his father's comrades to produce plastikwannen.
A short time later, they began to pflanzenölpressen to focus.
Within 18 years, they are the largest producer of automatic fit in the whole of Central Europe's.
But only mentioned by the success in the competition and its medialisierung is the awareness of the nicht-fachöffentlichkeit occurred.
"Not only that our customers the brand farmet play much more now, our foreign partners began the fact to be able to work with a firm, which has achieved the greatest possible success in their country, greater value to," says Karel žďárský.
The past year has been at farmet, however, not only in the sign of the siegeseuphorie.
The appreciation was a part of the economic results of the company in 2008 and 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of werkzeugbauprodukten.
The crisis, even less of the citizens at the time, but above all companies schüttelte, reached its peak in particular - many companies were forced to stop their investment plans and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"This situation, we could not escape of course."
"The sales went back by 40 percent, we had to restrict the production and even resort to redundancies," said Karel žďárský
A viable companies must sometimes take such unpopular measures.
But it managed to get the situation under control and to keep the company in the black figures, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In a the company was not willing to make any compromise - in the investment in the research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and schulungszentrum, we bestärkten our presentation on international measure and gained hauptpreise in domestic exhibitions," says žďárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales grow again and with them, the number of new staff.
"I wish the new winner to much joy of victory, but in more calm," does Karel žďárský towards.
An opinion poll to clean up the rules with misguided
The opinion poll by the "absurdity of the year" is the fourth time part of the unternehmerwettbewerbs.
Some nonsensical rules already managed to get out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next jahrgangs has become a "absurdity of the Year" in the poll the duty to create documents to authorities, which are available online.
As more than a third of decided not quite four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs.
That demanded the sozialversicherungsverwaltung a papierauszug from the handelsregister, even if it would have been the official by two mausklicks can access.
Thanks to the poll does this now.
"The Czech sozialversicherungsverwaltung will in future in inspections of sozialversicherungszahlern no extracts from the handelsregister more demand," led the Speaker of čssz jana buraňová.
Meaning and purpose of the poll "absurdity of the Year" Is it all regulations and orders to scrutinise have to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and lift the misguided.
This is the fourth time in earlier this year part of a unternehmerwettbewerbs by the tsch. wirtschaftszeitung - hn - will be held and enjoyed growing popularity in public.
If last year to the three thousand people involved in the vote, there were four thousand in earlier this year.
No surprise, because there is still a lot of legal obligations, the only serve to hinder the business.
"What, for example, the number of einkommenssteuerformulare is concerned, we are a front for a place in the world," said Karel havlíček by the Association of small and mittelständiger companies and gewerbetreibender the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business activity is the proclaimed goal of all governments in the last few years.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved, however.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in relation to the unternehmensbedingungen the 74. A rank, in comparison with the previous year, one to eight poorer places platzierung.
The absurdity of competition of the year was declared for the first time in years, and plays for equal scenario from every year.
Everyone can from April to the redaktionsschluss administrative and bureaucratic nonsense report of competition at the end of September.
To registration, the website address www.firmaroku.cz. then seeking the organisers of the seven candidates for the "antipreis" competition from the Internet and the public is on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz vote.
It prevails the absurdity that gets the most votes.
To this year's poll has been more than a hundred, specifically 105 senseless rules and orders registered.
The tipps come not only of entrepreneurs, but also of associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalisten" of competition are provisions for example that instandhaltungsfahrzeuge on motorways and schnellstraßen toll have to pay or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets every two years vorrichten must.
"seven of the Year" is the list published on the sides of the competition.
The declaration of the competition, each at the beginning of November at the Prague wenzelsplatz is part of a happenings regularly in the figures also take part of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva svobodová, the Director of small nuclear or mittelständiger companies and gewerbetreibender the tsch. Republic and Petr kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the tsch. Republic at the height of the competition with the game.
"Where the State raises the stick between the legs of entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my objective, every year at least thirty paragraphs lift today the entrepreneurs have unnecessarily aggravate their enterprise," Martin told kocourek, with the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create nonsensical orders from the World show effect.
In 2007 disrupted the people most duty imposed the entrepreneurs, the gewerbeamt at the place of their permanent company must notify the intention to three days in advance, with a ausstellungsstand an exhibition or kirmes wishing to travel.
This duty was force an amendment of the gewerbegesetzes lifted.
The duty, which received the largest number of votes in 2007, the duty of the arbeitsamt trips of workers in the scope of up to 30 days to declare - was abolished by the law on them sog. "Green Card."
And - All good things are three:
The regulation was elected to the absurdity of the Year 2009, the physiotherapeuten imposed, in the sprechzimmer a mirror, a refrigerator and two personenwaagen stand.
This regulation was somewhat alleviated by the Ministry of Health in this year, the kühlschrankpflicht fell way.
A new category honors socially responsible companies

A piece of news in this year's already fifth jahrgang of competition of the wirtschaftszeitung - hn - is the category "responsible Company of the Year 2010."
It is the idea of this competition to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support such companies, which are aware of the consequences of their business activity on the environment and socially responsible support initiatives," says patrik bartholdy, the regionalmanager of mobilfunkunternehmens vodafon, the ausrufer and guarantor of this competition, as the competition and "rebel" of the year.
The year's first jahrgang this particular unterkategorie of hauptwettbewerbs vodafon company of the year has firms for the success is not the only long term objective.
The history of each of them is very inspirativ and would enough substance for an independent article.
Although they are in relation to the subject of their work diametral distinguish, their efforts have still a common denominator, support and accommodation.
This is, for example, gehandicapte people because of personal problems or the health of their own staff.
Among the 14 finalisten appeared from the whole of the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software et netera on that supports the emergence of not formal sportteams under its staff, which would then take part in numerous play in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the region pardubice is the isolit-bravo society, which has been 17 years hauptsponsor of a stiftungsfonds for gehandicapte children.
A paper mill from poděbrady care exemplary of disabled employees for their health, which make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which they have been made with the title of "responsible company in the region mittelböhmen"; in the competition vodafone company of the year documented the third rank in the framework of this region.

"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to the consequences of our business and administration as low as possible to keep to the environment," declared their geschäftsführerin miluše ryznarová.
The responsible it-unternehmen enlogit from the region ústí nad labem, in turn, is concerned about the health of his staff and this is why it has to all of you notebooks ergonomische sessel and tastaturen purchased, It also promotes in their employees heimarbeit and in firmenaktionen it used cartering-dienstleistungen, protected by a domestic werkstatt will be offered.
"We also support the foundation" people in need, "the local roma-kommunität provides specific assistance," says ondřej suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, the activity of the reinigungsfirma "praní a čištění" from the region of Karlsbad worth noting that their employees in the form of extra-bonussen contributes to the pensions schemes.
"We give our employees contributions to the sustenance for the arbeitsweg, to increase their qualifications and for the holidays," says Joseph strapáč from the construction company czasch from bruntál, the winner in the mährisch-schlesischen region.
In the category of responsible Company of the year were automatically all bezirksfinalisten of competition vodafon company registered, the questions of the notification of the year beigelegten questionnaire beantwortetet him at the latest by the 15.august the organisers zuschickten.
Wrong or incomplete ausgefüllte answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the assessment by the organisers.
"If the representatives of the wetteifernden firms which left unanswered questions, they were excluded from the competition of" responsible Company of the Year," in the hauptwettbewerb vodafone company of the year they were so but not disqualifying. "
"A separate notification only to this competition is not possible because he only a unterkategorie of hauptwettbewerbs company of the year is," says Karel Goldman of the veranstaltenden Agency bison & Rose.
Pilsner bodenfonds - arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the bodenfonds in pilsen, the antikorruptionspolizei arrests in the last few days.
It was the European medien-unternehmer and immobilienhändler luboš G. of the detektiven paid in of handcuffs.
This had allegedly tried to just held a public competition on the conduct of restitutionsansprüchen to manipulate so that the land offered in competition a specific interested parties zufielen.
This is luboš G. have paid for half a million.
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person because of the delikts fraudulent activity followed with a public competition," said antonie zelená, the chefin of pilsner Prosecutor of the newspaper "právo," more details could not provide them with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-jährige entrepreneurs again released by the police.
In what way he could manipulate the public competition, that can be given the scant official information only speculate.
The speaker of the bodenfonds lubomír černá led to the relevant question of právo, the police have, in the pilsner antenna of bodenfonds actually made arrests and this during a public competition.
"It was about a clients, and not by one of our employees," konkretisierte them.
The public competition Mrs had černá according to the correct name 'call for angebotsabgabe of ambitions for the transfer of land, according to the bodengesetz "and would take place in cases in which several applicants interest in the land offered bezeigen.
"Offer these people within the framework of a higher value of their call by the transfer begleichenden restitutionsansprüche organised than the grundstückswert."
"in accordance with the demands offered is the order of the potential erwerber set, then gives the bodenfonds the piece to the person with the highest offer," said the Speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G. clear information were available, who had registered towards the call and because he was even legitimate person, because he is a number of restitutionsansprüchen had bought, he offered a grundstücksinteressen that he is withdrawing from the competition.
Obviously against a compensation of fats.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he was in such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had already too good contacts in the past to pilsner bodenfonds.
He played in the causa of the former head of the bodenfonds Vaclav sankota was prosecuted because it is a role in ersatzrestitutionen land stressing, which already standortentscheidungen had been taken to projects.
Then won luboš G. from the bodenfonds, for example, land, which were designed to build public roads, more precisely, to the point where the construction of the zufahrtsmagistrale to gewerbegebiet borské pole was planned.
Later tauschte he this very good with the magistrat directly against a house in the historic centre of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
The City Hall in had to back with a heavy heart kleinbeigeben, in order not to jeopardise the building project through the blockage of the land.
The wohnkosten rise of households by a few hundred per month
The households must from January not only with higher costs for all energiearten count, but also with more water and abwassergebühren and for district heating and grow in some places the rent.
Families will need to learn more from the wallet from January of several hundred kronor per month than before.
Electricity is expensive, up by 4.6 percent, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities, it will be up to a tenth must pay more for wasserlieferungen and some expensive the fernwärmelieferungen.
Only the stromteuerung costs the wohnungshaushalte several hundred kronor more every year.
The starkstrompreise were in the process of all hauptlieferanten reduced to blame is the clear support of the electricity from renewable sources, notably from fotovoltaikanlagen.
Gas is only moderately more expensive, but this is exactly when the people most heat and must have the highest consumption.
So here is to be with several hundred more kronor per year.
While electricity and gas across the Czech Republic will be expensive, the prices of district heating is different from city to city.
More places, in particular plan of price increases.
Need for example the households in pardubice and hradec králové from January for district heating up to 50 kronor per month pay more, more than 1000 kronor more families in liberec pay per year.
Again threaten the inhabitants of Prague 9% higher water and abwassergebühren and this to be the case that the CITY OF THE infrastrukturmiete increased.
If the miete not change, there are only 6.8 percent.
The price is one compared to the whole of the Czech Republic in Prague, however, continues to be the lowest.
In the nordböhmen, where the prices are already belong to the highest water and abwassergebühren rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge mietpreiserhöhungen, for example, are to be expected in 140, 000 mietwohnungen, in which from January the sog. mietregulierung ended.
For example, it is the wohnungsunternehmen cpi byty in ústí nad labem 2500 homes have just the same as of January in order to increase hundred percent.
Anyone with this mieterhöhung does not agree, the wants legal proceedings against the company.
The regulated rent one pays still in approximately 300,000 homes today, are likely to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children betrinken with fernet and beer rum is out, it is simply too slow
Fernet, vodka and rum, for a time, a good whisky, the father of the people from the hausbar has stolen.
These are the drinks to their benefit of drunken Czech teenagers under 15 most notbehandelt must be.
Children are no exception, its kater have repeatedly in the ausschlafen hospital.
This is clear from the experience of doctors, with similar cases in the opening of the kinderabteilungen faced by clinics.
"beer or wine are completely out of fashion, simply because it takes too long to get drunk."
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said právo luděk pelikán, the chefarzt the kinderabteilung in the mittelböhmischen clinic hořovice.
"whisky, if we are successful, the father of a bottle from the hausbar to entwenden, and if not, then at least fernet or vodka.
"vodka has the advantage of that you can mix it with juice, then, he is not so strong," said the chefarzt.
The speaker of the fakultätskrankenhauses motol Eva jurinová him is right.
"Most often, it is fernet or rum."
"That is today's alkoholtrend, notably in schools."
"We also wanted to take slibowitz, we are on board at home by well," Mrs led jurinová.
Chefarzt pelikán, according to dreizehn- or vierzehnjährige drinkers in the krankenhausaufnahme not long ausnahmeerscheinung.
Before the clinic in hořovice, he has been working for this year, he was ten years in the pädiatrie-abteilung ACT OF THE hospital motol, where the rettungswagen angetrunkene pupils from far and wide ablieferten.
"A girl had to four times hospitalisiert."
"They started their careers with 12 years ago, when the first time with a 3.5 level of alcohol in the blood and was still was taken in combination with" extase "to do so," a very serious case, described the doctor.
"It was in ausstellungsgelände in holešovice on any tanzparty."
"The interesting thing was that it was not strange that their mother 48 hours of their daughter was not home," at the chefarzt.
Is the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance to start with its own sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
To make a genuine dependency in the true sense of the word, according to experts, it is not in children.
"under Alcoholism is a longstanding chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case with these children."
Which enjoy the repeated alcohol, is mostly a negative familiär-sozialer background characteristic," says chefarzt pelikán.
The speaker of the hospital motol, Mrs jurinová according to were about 40 drunken children until the middle of November in the European Department of Child Care and jugendmedizin eingewiesen.
But only the cases with severe alkoholvergiftung, which is a krankenhausaufenthalt was needed to go in the statistics.
Drunk children after ambulatory care of the parents or, if necessary, will be brought home by the police, are not registered.
Out of the cases in which children only once a bottle of schnaps in the schulbank austrinken there is, in view of Mr pelikán three jahreszeitliche amplituden the reliance on 100%: walpurgisnacht, being New Year's Eve and the end of the academic year.
"the latter for two reasons, either from pain due to the poor zeugnisses or from Joy to the holidays."
"In the walpurgisnacht I have already seen seven drunken children at once in the opening," said Dr pelikán.
A betrunkenes Child, which spends the night under medical supervision, is better off as a child, paradoxically, it only the next day with an unpleasant kater has to fight.
The headache in the morning after which the dehydration and the glukosemangel arise, we can in a hospital with an flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion with glukose and nutrients, the absence of the organism, drive.
"Clearly they are better off because after the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, raise it with good humour on without taking hurts."
"They are just a little bit confused about where they are,," Dr pelikán, while the patients Sometimes he at least by the good humour in it, in that it will cost them the cost of the reality of the treatment.
Because the transportation with the rettungswagen and the night in a akutbett come good and happy to a few tens of thousands of kronor.
"Now and again, I have used this as erziehungsmittel, if I have the children for the trip vorgerechnet directly to what has cost their drunkenness and that it can happen very time that they have to work on all the holidays in order to earn the money for a single such fete," added Dr pelikán added.
In his opinion, the krankenkassen not, however, after regressverfahren, in order to heal the trunkenen children demand necessary cost of the parents.
Two trainingsflugzeuge l-159 for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighter planes l-159 of a total of five of the Czech Defense Ministry against the transportflugzeug Casa c-295m has replaced are on Tuesday flew in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish flugzeughersteller Casa - EADS siedelt.
It is the first time that aircraft of this type are in possession of a foreign army.

The einsitzigen fighter plane l-159 in turn were out in the long term eingelagerten aircraft singled out and that without further deposits and investments from the portfolio of the ministry.
"The doppelsitzigen l-159t1 were exchanged in current situation and look," said the newspaper pejšek právo.
He added that the army will not without zweisitzige fighter planes have to do, because the Defense Ministry in May 2009 with aero vodochody a 200-millionen-vertrag on the reconstruction of four unnecessary l-159 to zweisitzigen version signed.
A new aircraft, the army has taken over in July, the second to take it by the end of this year.
Pejšek according to EADS has to impose the fighter planes in the equipment of the NATO countries.
"The Treaty is clearly mentioned that the company EADS buyer of the aircraft l-159 is, and that this should serve to the training of pilots of the NATO countries.
Therefore," It is up to the abnehmers at the way he realised the matter," led pejšek.
The wirtschaftszeitung - hn - had previously reported that the Spanish Government of no interest in the l-159.
The trading one thing for another five l-159 against a transportflugzeug Casa and the purchase of new aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor last year was still has been approved by the Government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Defense Ministry had no tender advertised for shopping at the time, but spoke directly to EADS.
The then verteidigungsamt argued that this exchange will be the future export of l-159 support abroad.
The Czech army bought aero 72 machines from, of which they used only 24, the rest wanted to sell it.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft will also have a judicial sequel.
The European Commission sued the Czech Defense Ministry at the European Court of Justice. The reason? it would have the aircraft as a result of a ganzeuropäischen must choose tender, and not by raise a single manufacturer.
The army has already adopted three aircraft of CASA, the last is due to land on the airport kbely within 14 days.
A longer divided as ringfinger means a lower risk of contracting cancer
Men, whose divided is long, as the ringfinger are obviously a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprise result of a study, which was published by the British Journal of cancer on Wednesday.
This is connected with the mirror of the male hormone testosteron.
"Our results show that the length of the relative finger can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and notably in men to 60," said the mitautorin the study, ros eeles, Professor at krebsforschungsinstitut at the university in warwick.
The finger could help to determine what men at a prostatakrebs-test should undergo, especially if there is genetic risks or any other risk factors, such as the family health burden, Mrs added eeles added.
In the period from 1994-2009 followed them with their colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time, 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants of the study was the divided the right hand shorter than the ringfinger.
For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as for 19 percent of those men, whose ring- and were divided equally long.
In men whose divided longer than the ringfinger was this risk, however, fell by 33 percent in men and 60 even by 87 percent.
The relationship of the length of the two mentioned finger, which are already in prenatal age, clearly reflected the different mirror of geschlechtshormonen, which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosteron corresponds to a longer divided.
Earlier research showed that the testosteron accelerate the growth of prostate cancer.
Vaclav pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said čtk that he is aware of this study fleeting, yet he is the relationship between the fingerlänge and the cancer has not been completely proven "for."
The Czech Republic in snow - D1 and d5 are closed
As well as the biggest part of Europe is also the Czech Republic on Thursday morning under a schneedecke.
On the streets and gehwegen is mostly our snow, the winterdienstler were the whole night at axis in many places.

Most of the roads in südmähren are only with greater caution befahrbar.
In order vyškov are three country completely unbefahrbar, on the outskirts of brno form in places schneeverwehungen and on the outskirts of blansko one is forced to work on some more nearby roads schneefräsen.
One of the most affected areas is výškov.
There are three roads are still completely closed: rousínov - slavkov, bohdalice - kučerov and šaratice - milešovice.
Here, too, will be the schneeräumung schneefräsen must use.
When they get befahrbar, cannot estimate up to now.
In the region hodonín is in the area of weißkarpaten caution is needed.
On the streets from naturschutzgründen only with inerten streumitteln can be disseminated is one of up to five centimeters thick schneedecke, led čtk.

American soldiers have a new "smart weapon."
The American troops have used a new "smart" weapon for the first time in Afghanistan, which has only under their codebezeichnung xm-25 is known.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon of the conflict there influenced with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favour.
The new weapon is such a thing as a supergenaue kanone.
Their projektile is by lasers with a treffsicherheit drawn by only a few metres into the goal.
The Special bullets of mould 25 mm, which have been developed for this gun and hochexplosiven contain explosives, work practically as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed so that they not only in terms of impact on the target, but at any point of their ballistic flugbahn can explode.
That means that you can use them against an enemy, behind an obstacle - a wall or in schützengraben means.
From the top, he is usually not protected, the murderous stahlsplitterregen from above, it is easy to put out of combat.
Richard audett according to the to the development of the xm-25 involved, is the new kampfgewehr the first infanteriewaffe to harness the technology "intelligent."
"The soldier is basically as before: he visiert the objective and sends a laserstrahl determined from the distance, he wins a precise visierpunkt, after which he erhöhungswinkel corrected, then he needs only abzudrücken.
"We say that one has measured 543 m."
"If you abdrückt, has invited the weapon and shooting the geschoss at the distance 543 metres from plus minus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs will be transferred
The company Fujitsu shifted its branch in bad homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of next year will be 400 employees their jobs from the previous bürogebäude on marienbader place in bad homburg move in the astro park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu shifted its branch in bad homburg to Frankfurt.
As the specialist on computers and their maintenance branchenriese be informed on Wednesday in July of next year, 400 men and women their jobs from the previous bürogebäude on marienbader place in bad homburg move in the astro Park, this is a great bürokomplex in the lyoner road in Frankfurt district niederrad.
A Speaker of Fujitsu explained, in the medium term, should there be housed the group's for another 100 jobs, which are distributed so far in the region.
The mietangebot was extremely attractive, and would be the großraumbüros in park astro better against the operations of the staff.
Also in bad homburg Fujitsu was been only tenants.
The responsible CEO Bernd Wagner said, "with frankfurt-niederrad, we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is especially important for a global companies such as Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region called yesterday showed joy in the winners and disappointment among the losers.
The Frankfurt wirtschaftsdezernent Markus frank - CDU - said it is once again a "global player" has been won.
This was a "great standortbekenntnis."
Fujitsu passe is an important stimulus for the city, the establishment niederrad.
The bad homburger Mayor Michael korwisi - the green - regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city is early reduced the management has been informed about the intention.
"We have offered our assistance to the company of course," said korwisi.
But the friendly contacts have nothing to the difficulties of the computerherstellers with the vermieter property at the marienbader place can change.
Ultimately would have been a deciding factor of economic reasons.
Leaving now it is a long leerstand to prevent in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owners and vermieter of the building is cooperative."
The House used so far of Fujitsu on rathausplatz and the neighbouring "small vertical" included with the other buildings on marienbader place ten years ago to the controversial construction projects of the kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private projektentwicklers arose between the station and the City Hall in a new stadtentree because both the massive development of land used part as a parking lot before, as the level of the building for criticism.
2001, included the anlageberatungs- and ratingunternehmen feri, the software-hersteller for reisevertriebssysteme, start amadeus, and at the time still associated with Siemens computerhersteller Fujitsu the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu was in 2006 by the German Frankfurt immobilien-chancen-gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund acquired and a year later to the Spanish falcon real estate investments sa resold in Madrid.
Based in Tokyo, fujitsu-konuzern are called the third largest it-provider in the world.
It is companies, for example, computers and server prepared and makes the necessary service.
The establishment in the rhein-main-gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, is much more employees Fujitsu but in Munich.
From bad homburg is the subsidiary, Fujitsu technology solutions in frankfurt-niederrad, the other subsidiaries in this location to Fujitsu services and a company called tds.
For that, in the bürogebäude astro park 7000 hired square metre.
Twenty years old in the complex, is playing on the name of his sternförmigen grundriss - has, among other things, the zentralverband elektrotechnik- and elektronikindustrie its headquarters.
Amazon blocking server - threats against assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble.
The internet-dienstleister Amazon has the enthüllungsplattform from his servern exiled.
May is behind it political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomaten-depeschen.
Wikileaks-gründer assange is supposed to be in England.
The enthüllungsplattform WikiLeaks equipment in the United States are increasingly under attack.
The internet-aktivisten lost access to their previous American server and now seek a internet-heimat in Europe.
The prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman, however, the boycott of WikiLeaks on other countries and companies.
And wikileaks-gründer Julian assange on the fahndungslisten is of Interpol, is following a zeitungsbericht stop in Britain.
"WikiLeaks of amazon-server crowded out."
"free speech" in the land of the free, shared the enthüllungs-aktivisten by kurznachrichtendienst Twitter on Wednesday - local time - with.
Shortly before had the internet-unternehmen Amazon the wikileaks-dokumente from his servern exiled.
The internet-aktivisten had in the publication of the secret diplomatic depeschen on the Amazon Web service - AWS - used, in order to be able to meet the high zugriffszahlen on the documents.
By Twitter said WikiLeaks to the step further: "Fine - our dollars will now be spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon have this kind of problem with the freedom of speech," They should stop to sell books."
Amazon have stopped after the use of its server by WikiLeaks staff had investigation of Senator Joe Lieberman, the CNN television reported by referring to the office liebermans.
The Chairman of the senatsausschusses for heimatschutz Amazon had threatened with a boycott, reported the British "guardian."
"I would have liked that Amazon used to take this measure in view of the previous publications klassifizierter information by WikiLeaks," the senator said.
Lieberman meanwhile called to the platform in other countries to use the servern to deny.
"WikiLeaks' illegal, ungeheuerliches and reckless action is part of our national security at risk and live around the globe at risk," hießt it in a communication of the leading French senator.
"No responsible companies, whether American or ausländisch - should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks-gründer assange for vergewaltigungsverdachts is being sought by the authorities in Sweden, is on the fahndungsliste of Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent" is the 39-jährige Australians in Britain on the exact location was Scotland Yard brought known.
The internet-aktivist the investigation in Sweden has always described as divide of his opponents.
Wikileaks-sprecher kristinn hrafnsson said in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls for an assassination of Julian assange."
Therefore, fear assange rightly for his safety, said hrafnsson.
The wikileaks-gründer will therefore continue to keep hidden.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of arkansas, Mike huckabee, demanded that the responsible for the wikileaks-enthüllungen should be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, a consultant of leader said Stephen harper - obviously ironic - on television, assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drohne."
Between the White House and assange entbrannte Meanwhile a just.
Barack Obama, the spokesman of the American President Robert gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that assange had called for the resignation of Secretary Hillary Clinton, if it is for recently bekanntgewordene spionage-aufforderungen is responsible to diplomats.
"I am not quite sure why we are concerned about the opinion of a types with a website," gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its a web page."
The American government is now the protection of their databases fully on the test.
As a special envoy is the vize-direktor of the Centre for anti-terror-maßnahmen, russell travers, been appointed, shared with the White House.
Travers is responsible for "necessary structural reforms" to develop, after the disclosure of the botschaftsberichte by WikiLeaks had become necessary.
The White House wants to check the ways, as exchange information and protects the whole government.
The American Government also announced for trying to ensure the safety of dissidents and the most active, they should be by the wikileaks-veröffentlichung in danger.
"We have done everything to come in contact with them," said außenamtssprecher Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them, if it should be necessary."
The eis-universität
In the "gelato university" in Bologna be eiskonditoren prepared for better seasons.
The three grundkurs for future gelatieri has the most violence and visitors from all over the world.
Where is actually the whole ice?
The gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere, something in German altertümlich the eiskonditor is the cream after all the rules of the Italian eismacherkunst since.
The gelataio takes on a spachtel the eiscreme from the kühltheke, it abolishes in the waffel and sold it.
In order to know this, you do not have to anzola Dell emilia drive in the province of Bologna.
But who would like to know more about ice, which is not yet in the "gelato-university" of the Italian company carpigiani over.
The eis-universität, the manufacturers of eismaschinen set up in 2003, so that the eiscreme from his machines will meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
Of the three grundkurs for future gelatieri has the biggest violence and visitors from around the world.
But there are also mehrtägige spezialkurse around the schokoladeneis and work experience in the hauseigenen eisdiele.
Some dreams in the midlife-crisis of a new career, other car simply time to complete ice their vague aspirations.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, kunstlehrer from California, loves the slow-food-bewegung and wants to offer a quality European product in the industrial ice-cream country in future.
Anke from Berlin is unternehmensberaterin and wants to after years in a nervenaufreibenden job something of their own eintüten.
Two young ägypterinnen dream of to open a eisdiele in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil to improve the quality of its bars eiscreme - and the Canadian housewife Yulia is because their children Italian eiscreme love.
Maestro-gelatiere luciano Ferrari declared the participants first the ideal characteristics of the perfect eiscreme.
Is crucial not only good taste, but also the seidige geschmeidigkeit and the good consistency.
Luciano forgets in its training but not the icing on the cake of national and at all südländischen überbaus: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of Romanticism."
The first step for the production seems very simple.
Luciano kippt the grundzutaten milk, put cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a major mixgerät, all with an electronic programme heated to 85 degrees and then immediately slows to four degrees.
Then he is on the machine on a Hahn, and it is a pasteurisierte white basiscreme basis for all milcheissorten.
Immediately, the dozent with issues bestürmt: can we eiscreme only with natural substances without stabilisator produce?
How can we own the experimentierlust let free course?
Luciano warns, to lead from the spirit in the wrong.
Who of eiscreme "only from natural ingredients" speech, has perhaps, stabilisers used - mostly a product of nature, such guarkernmehl from the guarbohne.
Of course you can hold without stabilisator produce, only it must then be sold within a day or sackt it in together, and the customer bites on the eiskörnchen.
Some variations in the grundmasse are allowed.
With the flavourings, there is more exciting.
Different in the ice for the taste maestro luciano between the ingredients, the one in the obst-abteilung or sweets in the supermarktes buying.
Also, there are powder and pasten.
"The suppliers are all trying to dozens of them aromatisierte additions anzudrehen."
"But they should simply time to experiment."
Either in the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh früchten.
Or just in the eiscreme from the White grundmasse the yellow cream with eggs and with kakaopulver the basis for all kinds of schokoladen-verführungen.
Now, the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen.
Luciano leaves they each of four different types of vanille-, schokolade-, mokka- and haselnuss-eis produce, with or without eggs in the grundmasse, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural zusätzen.
The same experiment will also the fruchteissorten subjected to.
More aromas which, more frucht-püree - more is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss-eis tastes not necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi-eis used is the group since the more fruits, less water and a little less stabilisator.
Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a gelato shows right, says luciano.
Eisherstellung is a rechenaufgabe: will pfirsich-püree used with a lot of sugar, the zuckeranteil in grundrezept be reduced.
For zitroneneis is a extraportion sugar needed.
Luciano is a machine, often with which he the sugar content of the fruchtsorten determined - wine producers are concerned measure so that the oechsle in traubenmost -.
Fortunately, facilitate the tables rechnerei.
To make ice requires not more physical use as much as it used to be.
Not only the machine for the automatic production of the grundmasse helps.
There is also a machine, completed in the eis-mischung at the same time, cremig beaten and to minustemperaturen is kept.
Of all automatisierung to remain despite not from small hiccups.
The Brazilians gustavo bekleckert itself and its kurskollegen from top to bottom, with fruchtpüree than him überdimensionale stabmixer spiral out of control.
"In any course," says maestro luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Controllers in the zwielicht
The European Food Safety Authority EFSA was the with genpflanzen experimentierenden undermined industry.
These accusations formulated now the group testbiotech as independent Institute for understands the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a verschwörungstheorie, but we have it well documented," said testbiotech-chef Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the efsa-expertengruppe on genetically modified crops, Harry kuiper and another efsa-experte are for years and the lobbyistenverband ilsi under the Treaty.
The will of groups such as Monsanto, nestle or Bayer paid.
Kuiper was instrumental in the efsa-prüfvorschriften contributed for genpflanzen and am so then criticized in a clear conflict of interest.
The efsa-vorschriften are absatzweise wortgleich with positionspapieren the ilsi and to deceive the mark of the industry, which is to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that testbiotech a interessenskollision bemängle.
Was a senior efsa-managerin recently without restrictions or transitional period on the Swiss agrarkonzern syngenta - and I have to ensure that the sides.
The mitteldeutsche radio - mdr - had recently human links between kontrollierender EU agency and industry lobby revealing what the umweltbundesamt as well as eu-parlamentarier has made suspicious.
However the EFSA can see no conflict of interest.
We will take back to every serious data, also on such industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, it said in a statement.
The experts working for EFSA, we do not demand that they have no contacts with the industry.
But they should disclose them.
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute - ilsi - in the United States.
This described itself as a neutral forum for science, industry and politics, among other things, experts from the risikoabschätzung for biotechnology without lobbyauftrag.
Criticised in the matter of independent experts as then that genetically modified crops is currently without any fütterungsversuch be permitted in animals and the reaction of genpflanzen shall not tested on the environmental impact.
"We want to know what, for example of genetically modified maize in the acker power," says then.
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole genpflanze to test what no reliable results liefere.
"If you do not seek the risks, how can we find it then?" asks then anklagend.
This is also Angelika hilbeck so.
The research scientist in the genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently in the Technical University of Zurich direct action.
Attempts in this area as the industry in the United States now in Europe is becoming more critical to influence or discredit scientists.
There is so little more researchers, not with groups are interlinked.
Critical studies for companies would not published in the rule.
"The industry controls the research," said hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli gsell has also What concerned, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he was have stuttgarter station, the tuba on the back.
It was demo.
It schneite.
The history is well known: in September the excavators were angerückt and had begun a major piece of the nordflügels break off.
The stuttgarter world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against s21, having to inject billions tieferlegung of the bahnhofs.
When it came to the Settlement Freeze, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Collapsed in 6,000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer muschelkalk, a soft gross stone, between 1914 and 1920, verbaut.
Gsell is bildhauer in ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured a few of the slice.
"These stones are reliquien."
"They must not go away."
He schwärmt: "A cheaper and poor stone, simple and erdenhaft."
When he is a aufsägte have after zigarettenqualm gerochen.
He still do not know what he will do with the slice.
Stones have time.
Uli gsell.
The trail of the stuttgarter stones leads in a forest in tübingen on a former munitionsdepot of the French army, where Manuel rongen be stein-reich has built.
The 44-jährige is with old stones.
He has bought all on the demolition in stuttgart fell.
"It would be a shame, you would schotter gemahlen or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a holzbüdchen, that was once an wachhäuschen.
Named and it was threatened, he told, as was in September in the newspapers that he remains of the nordflügels from abbruchunternehmer have bought.
But he has with the s-21-gegnern talk for several days.
And he has told them that he but now relate all brief nothing for could.
And if it is now even, then it is but the most sensible If the stones were used.
About 200 s-21-gegner, then one of the average 80 kilos of serious quader with, stückpreis 6,50 euro to 14.
As a memory, but some also in the hope of being able to return him in a reconstruction.
Had 500 tonnes of rongen bought large truckloads of 25.
About half being stored in the forest, the rest is long sold.
Gartenbesitzer, landschaftsgärtner, häuslebauer.
Whether they come from everywhere and would have weggeschleppt what kofferraum and supporters had to bear.
The stuttgarter stones of the initiation have long turned in "mäuerle" or limits of kräuterbeeten.
"Actually this stone is nothing special," says rongen.
"would not be the political Dimension."
He is in his SUV, makes a tour by 20 hectares of great empire.
Jura he has studied and later suspended biology, then he is interested for computers and, after all, is steinhändler become.
And steinliebhaber.
40000 tonnes of stones being stored it.
From throughout Germany karrt His value together.
He says that he was the biggest of the Republic altsteinhändler.
He put brakes on it.
The snow is skilful behauene sandsteine.
"They were once part of the Dresden marienbrücke," he told.
Elbsandstein, amber, warm, he schwärmt.
"My lieblingsstein."
It is the way of high through the forest.
It shows in a heap: red sandstein, used to be part of the karlsruher bahnhofs.
And further.
"Beautiful travertin."
Once included the quader to the gallery of the stuttgarter neckarstadions.
Stones across the snow and stories, cannstatter travertin from the stuttgarter polizeipräsidium, rötlicher granit from the Cathedral of Saint blasien, tuff from Heilbronner hospital.
The work of the effort, which sweat.
If rongen to think of how the stones used by hand gehauen and with simple flaschenzügen and ochsenkarren were moved, it will be very ehrfürchtig.
"It would be a scandal if we have such a thing schreddern would."
He is not rich become immensely rich Certainly not.
But 14 people in the steinhändler today, also have high in the steinmetze forest, a bildhauer, a schmied, a glasbläser and a gartenbauer settled.
"We are working very hard, but it is satisfactory," says the resteverwerter.
He must soon to Cologne.
Also there is to save stones.
Talentekampf to high-potentials
There is flourishing andrang on buffet.
16 students are to lachsbrötchen, tomatensuppe and süßes.
The Technical University braunschweig and Volkswagen of cars have the maschinenbau- and designstudenten invited to a workshop.
In a way ideenwettbewerb should they, together with vw-entwicklern on the car of the future jargon - and incidentally with Volkswagen.
In the competition for the brightest are now many companies in the nahkampf and set as vw, in cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: the most gifted graduates as early as possible in the hörsälen to recruit before they come to the labour market and other umworben.
And because the University does not aufstellungen issue on the achievements of their students, we tried the ausnahmetalente in praxisprojekten to spot and to tie.
On the second day of the workshops of The TU braunschweig is the autokonzern about the talent.
A young lady from the human resources departments distributed pen, gummibärchen and mappen with vw-logo.
They told the hopeful jungtalenten of praktikumsprogrammen and studentenjobs and shows them ways in the company.
Nico selle of The TU braunschweig care of the project with vw.
He sees the benefits for both sides," the students are in contact with the industry and collect experience."
"vw can know students at the same time, interesting candidate closer angucken and think about who would be as a staff in question."
Such cooperation, selle are not unusual.
New is that so aggressively to the students gebuhlt will.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says selle.
The battle for the fresh graduierten will probably be even harder.
In many industries, the companies of their staff cannot choose more from a large crowd of candidates.
But they must praise and especially for highly skilled workers balzen.
Above all, graduates from the ingenieurdisziplinen are in an excellent negotiating position in this regard.
According to the Association of German engineers vdi remained in October over 40,000 ingenieurstellen unfilled.
And the supposed ingenieurlücke will, according to vdi-prognosen will be even greater.
For the wirtschaftsprüfungs- and consultant kpmg novel is dykta on the talentjagd.
He organised elaborate recruiting-events such as the kpmg-race, a kind of modern schnitzeljagd, in which the participants in gps-koordinaten need to find their way.
Eight promising students want to send the companies across the United States in the next year.
Incidentally can look at the participants kpmg-filialen and to know the company.
With who must decide in two auswahlrunden in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of many candidates flies in the United States.
When they can and burning in the high potentials at the universities of the geschütze according to dykta increasing.
"We want us to withdraw from the mass with the race."
"Only a simple segeltörn was not enough for us."
For talentjäger dykta seems the bill aufzugehen.
"Until now we have contact with all the participants of a similar action last year."
"Some is in its final and will soon apply to us," he says.
In addition to the direct court on campus, particularly small and medium sized enterprises also very Classic in berufsmessen on the pirsch.
"We try graduates at fachmessen to achieve."
"around on the intersolar," reported sitha stübe, personalleiterin the solartechnikhersteller solarworld.
The Bonn company employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the nachwuchsproblematik.
Currently are on the unternehmenswebsite advertised 35 posts.
"It is very difficult to vakante to occupy positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact on the uni-professoren.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities around the university in freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you make work experience with us or its diplomarbeit can write."
Expensive werbeaktionen are the solarspezialisten not needed.
For trying to promote the company with other benefits: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"This can be a großkonzern often do not offer," says personalleiterin stübe.
Money plays in the jobsuche long no longer the lead role.
Flexible hours, childcare or good upward mobility were key factors are further.
Solarworld documented in a study of a Great Place to Work Institute the 55th place among the 100 Best Employers of Germany.
The Institute produced an annual bestenliste German employers.
Asked about it it as satisfied with their work and their staff jobumfeld and look at the conditions for the workers.
Personalleiterin stübe hopes the platzierung also advantages in the jobsuchenden.
"I think that candidates look especially after external assessments about a potential employers," she says.
Wolf pure kriegler by the German employer branding Academy is advising companies that want to build a good reputation as employers with a long term strategy.
He advises its customers to more authenticity.
And that means, according to kriegler internal measures, in particular.
"The best way to make attractive as employers, leads on the staff of their own," he says.
In the branchenjargon means the internal employer branding, so arbeitgebermarkenbildung within its own workforce.
"satisfied staff are the best Ambassador."
If the good of its people do unto and they identify with the company, then they would be alone in known friends and to promote their employers.
"This is like a game with gang," says kriegler.
Obama stop New ölbohrungen
Off the coast of the us-bundesstaats Florida in the Gulf of Mexico will be in the coming years, no new ölbohrungen.
A similar ban, the government has enacted in Washington - and so finally revoked their earlier plans.
Remain above the Atlantic coast of New bohrungen prohibited for the time being.
This told Interior Minister Ken excused Salazar on Wednesday.
Causes of the strict ban should apply that at least for the next five years, is the explosion of bohrplattform "deepwater horizon" in April.
Before the accident, which claimed the lives of 11 workers and had led to the greatest ecological disaster in the US President Barack Obama signaled its willingness to pressure from the opposition and the industry, new bohrungen allowing in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the dependency of the United States of the supply of oil from abroad.
Anyone who bears the responsibility for the disastrous oil slick in the Gulf is not finally settled until today.
At the centre of the criticism is the British energiekonzern BP, with milliardenforderungen will face.
A commission of inquiry in Obama's mission is to in the course of the dezembers present their results.
In October, Interior Minister Ken had excused Salazar imposed after the explosion bohrstopp lifted.
At the end, several oil companies had immediately applications for new bohrvorhaben asked.
Obama want with stricter inspections and stricter safety regulations and excused Salazar exclude a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority at the present time after was discredited in the eyes of many corruption charges, radically reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced a lucrative steuerschlupflöcher for the oil and gaskonzerne to close.
The industry warns now publicly before, that the fördermenge in the Gulf by a stricter regulation would be far lower than before.
"The Government's plans are the largest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent branchenumfrage by the association of consultants bdo - Before the bohrverbot of Wednesday.
The American energy alliance also complained the insecurity in the industry: "Nobody knows what exactly will change with the regulation."
Investments in new projects funded by - at the expense of growth would be postponed until further notice.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, as the smell of the tankstelle: billion litres of ausgelaufenes crude oil have nature in the Nigerian ogoniland destroyed.
The lives of people of theft, corruption and illegal ölkochen.
Celestine akpobari means well.
"has hit you not from," reassured the ökoaktivist the journalists: "Today you will have enough oil in the linse wars."
The 37-jährige Nigerians has followed the attempt to the chest in the water, a watenden young with around him schlieren abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen wasserglanz is the scene of almost beautiful.
That under the surface, Brown rohölschwaden tops, is not to be seen.
Used to have you here eimerweise shrimps collected, told esther badom on the shores of bodo-jetty-flusses.
The lazy fluid waters is now completely dead.
Five years ago, poured from a geborstenen rohrleitung quantities of crude oil in the huge river wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby städtchen bodo must now rowing for six hours in fischhaltige waters to REACH: that at the heart of the nigerdeltas located ogoniland is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world.
On the trip by the flussläufen durchzogenen mangrovensümpfe will be the full extent of the verheerung striking.
Instead of helles water wühlt the motorboot Brown brühe on who his hand into the water, is ölige fingers out.
The roots of the mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black lakritzstangen from the ground, they can occasionally involved palmen their wedel hanging.
Vogelschwärme, as they are usual in wetlands, is in vain: as soon as the außenborder remains silent spreading in the sweep as a tankstelle former paradise gespenstische calm.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says celestine akpobari gloomy: "We live in constant danger to the health."
The kriegsvergleich is appropriate.
The siedlungsgebiet the ogoni is akin to disputed battlefield for decades: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorateure from Europe, organized here in the 1980s with the later exekutierten writer Ken saro-wiwa the first resistance here to shell-konzern 1993 to cease its production because it for its ölarbeiter was too dangerous.
Even today the company is the return to ogoniland denied that, while from the whole of deltaregion Of the Triple size of Switzerland, with about 5,000 bohrquellen and 700 miles rohrleitungen be pumped more than two million barrels daily of the black gold are the oil fields in the ogoniland broke to the corporation, the situation is unstable.
Every few hundred metres stand out stählerne gestelle as bizarre skulpturen out of the water," christbäumchen "are the heads of the bohrlöcher much to zärtlich mentioned.
They are up to 50 years old, the most to the core korrodiert.
Again and again breche such a bohrkopf apart, says akpobari, then rinne a constant flow of crude oil into the water.
After more than two billion litres are expertenschätzungen every year to the ecosystem of the delta involved in 50 years: the amount of oil, as in the accident of the supertankers "exxon valdez" 21 years ago into the sea before Alaska drive - one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of mankind.
Who for the ongoing öko-gau is to blame, it will be fought.
During the shell-konzern sabotage and organised öldiebstahl is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see berstende bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as main causes.
Shell in Nigeria attach much lower standards than usual else in the world, accused the us-wissenschaftler Richard, Steiner, the corporation in 2008: only the rate of defects in the pipes was "enormously higher than elsewhere."
In a place from distant as an abandoned, ölverschmierte werkstatt is conducted under the open sky, there are from the mangroven make: they are splitternackt and up to the neck ölverschmiert.
Under one of the many fässer, the part with röhren linked to discern some arbitrary scattered on the site, flackert a fire: an illegal kleinraffinerie.
Heated in barrels of the crude oil on the fire for several hours, said Michael, the leader of the group.
Insist petrol through the pipes in the first auffangtopf later tröpfelt issued at the end of the management of kerosene, and diesel fuel.
That produce Michael and four employees up to four a day fässer 300 litres of diesel à: "This brings us 34.000 naira A" - around 22 dollars.
The deltabewohner use the chronic treibstoffknappheit in the largest erdölstaat schwarzafrikas.
Nigeria has a single refinery.
The with less than 40 euro-cent per litre ridiculously low dieselpreis can still undercut the illegal immigrants kocher: because they get their raw material in vain.
He comes from "bunkerern" The pipelinenetz across ogoniland tap: go on this way, the country according to experts in the whole of the Niger Delta lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day.
Only a very small part of the provisionally zwischengelagerten raw material, illegally veredelt: fill the lion's share of organised criminal networks, which include politicians and senior military to tankers and verscherbeln him on the world market.
The debate of whether the environmental disaster rather umtrieben of the population or is due to lax production, the activist akpobari for purely academic.
"The oil companies will not perceived as invaders and they would have the livelihood of fishermen not so thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
Now is the ratio of ogoni especially shell but destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the group's question would be: "Perhaps other nationalities are as the Chinese as better out."
As Michael will be nervous.
"high time that her to disappear," says the muskulöse ölmann.
"The soldiers can come every minute."
The illegal ölveredler caught by the Special Forces, threatens not arrest them, but I think a painful schmiergeld.
The soldiers originating mainly from the north, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the commodity.
"This downright stuff has brought our country in every respect to the dog," says akpobari.
Researchers discover dangerous baufehler in a380-triebwerken
The A380 has obviously a major security problem.
Investigators have in the investigation of a notgelandeten machine a possible baufehler discovered that could lead to a "disastrous triebwerksausfall."
The airline qantas now wishes to the motorenhersteller Sue.
The passengers of the notgelandeten qantas-airbus had at the beginning of November appears to be much more aware of luck as so far: the Australian luftsicherheitsbehörde has a major security problem in their investigations in the triebwerken some a380-maschinen established - and now warns against a possible baufehler.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in a ölschlauchverbindung he could ermüdungsrisse and produce leaks, it said in a statement published on this Thursday of the Authority atsb.
This would have to be "a katastrophalem triebwerksausfall can cause."
Are affected by rolls-royce produced triebwerke in 20 aircraft a380-reihe.
Among them is the qantas-airbus, on the fourth of November in Singapore notlanden had to.
The Australian airline has now legal action against the British turbinenhersteller taken.
They filed a klagebegründung in an Australian Federal Court in Sydney that enable him further legal action against the company.
Qantas-chef Alan Joyce said his airline will demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
In the fire of the motors had resolved parts and damaged the wings.
Rolls-royce made a ölbrand as a cause for the damage.
After the incident the world must now up to 40 triebwerke be replaced.
The Australian researchers announced that further sicherheitstests to the superjumbos carry out with the affected triebwerken are equipped.
The sicherheitsempfehlung was the result of cooperation with rolls-royce, said atsb-sprecher Martin dolan.
The security problem had been thought to be important enough to inform all concerned.
After the notlandung the qantas-maschine the airline had their a380-flotte kept on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines was about three of its A380 eleven temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa changed in an A380 as a precaution, the triebwerk.

German bank is seeking a buyer for its zwillingstürme
The German Bank wants her wahrzeichen separate, according to a zeitungsbericht seeking the geldhaus buyers for the two bürotürme to their headquarters in Frankfurt.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property.
The German Bank has just their konzernsitz made beautiful: the zwillingstürme in Frankfurt bankenviertel have been modernised. Now the bankers were allowed back to their old jobs.
But now wants of the cost of the renovation finanzkonzern apparently results again - and is looking for a buyer for the two tower blocks, as the "Financial Times" Germany under appeal to a spokesman writes.

This is Germany's largest credit institution said after a short period of time, and again from its headquarters.
The bank had the doppeltürme only in 2007 for 272 million euros by the investors of a hauseigenen Fund adopted and then expensive to be repaired.
The reconstruction of energy verschlang the data after some 200 million euros.
A sale would bring the Bank would seem to be a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the now in "greentowers" umbenannten towers, according to the newspaper, around 500 million euros.

Thousands mourn for dead mate
More than 10,000 people have thought the miners spilled in New Zealand, which were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still the bodies could not be recovered because the security situation in the unglücksschacht is still precarious.
Barely two weeks ago, it was in the pike River mine near the town of greymouth come to a severe explosion.
29 bergarbeiter between the ages of 17 and 62 years were buried under days.
A sonde was in the unglücksschacht hinabgelassen had been discovered but no sign of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of poisonous gases and other subsequent explosions could not for security reasons rettungskräfte hinabsteigen.
After the second heavy detonation were the authorities and experts expected that there was no chance of survival for the buddy more.
The bodies have not been recovered.
Now flash relatives and friends with a commemoration of the dead.
Tens of thousands of people had in radioactive sonnenschein in greymouth on the New Zealand südinsel gathered.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In honour of the buried miners were 29 tische set on which helme were to see light bulbs and the name of buddy.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes, and surfbretter, found its place here.
Before the regierungsgebäuden of the country wehten the flags on halbmast.
New Zealand have hoped that the miners' from the depths of the earth "would come back to the surface, said the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemoration.
"But they have never come home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son, as long as he does not have seen the body, said lawrie drew, whose son zen has been buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on 19 November were miners have been buried British and South African origin.
Rettungsarbeiter began with a fire in the heart of the kohlebergwerks on the südinsel New Zealand to delete.
As soon as the explosive gases are forced out, it will start the fervent temperatures in the heart of the mine herunterzukühlen, said polizeipräsident Gary knowles to journalists.
To hell, warriors.
Suits splatter the kunstkino?
The director Nicolas winding refn lotet with his kämpfer-epos "walhalla rising" old genre-grenzen new.
To which audience may Danish director Nicolas winding refn have thought when he "walhalla rising" films?
A prisoner wikinger-krieger with only one eye - mads mikkelsen - liberated from its peinigern and sets with almost superhuman powers to his opponents by the dozen - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero like rough tötungsmethoden served and his enemies have time the gedärme is breaking from the limb living, if he has bad humour.
On the other hand, says einauge, as he is referred to in fact not a word on the whole film, and the other characters can only be time to one or two rates or a few painful todesschreien carried away.
Otherwise, silent and in the gruselig fine hügellandschaft of Scotland geschwelgt the wikingerwelt offers the backdrop of around a thousand years ago.
More ideal for adults cineasten with interest for existentialismus and very calm kamerafahrten.
Nice if a film has several target groups, a pity only if they are mutually exclusive.
Director winding refn applies since its wild and gestylten drogendealer-trilogie "pusher" as a kind of Danish version of quentin tarantino, but refuses stoisch, his works with a little more humour the mainstream or a little less brutality of the arthouse accessible to make.
Most of the kunstkino-freunde should around by the spritzenden gehirnmasse and the gedärmen to deter.
The action-fans die then before boredom at the latest, if einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons, with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem aufbricht and trapped in slump and fog, an eternity before the team seems to matter in America, and there is still silent.
No wonder, then, that "walhalla rising in Germany" does not kino-verleih has found and is now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly because of the magnificent images of a jammer, but also because behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hiding a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which has something worthy of attention.
In this film is not about dialogues or a stringent act, it is all atmosphere, a filmgewordener fiebertraum.
And from which there is no escape to the viewers.
Refn gönnt it hardly a moment of relaxation and like him with its icy pictures and the dark trance-artigen soundtrack very slowly to the throat, but above all with the stunning hatred of him from the heart of the characters runs.
Only a small blonder young, the einauge is true to the side, retains such a thing as innocence, all the others will be driven by anger.
The vast majority of the einäugige hero whose motives are never declared, but for enemies and allies at some point to the warriors from the hell will temporarily, perhaps even to the Ambassador of the devil.
It means spoil, but perhaps only for the already verdorbenen.
"walhalla rising" is a more puzzling film that you can hate and admire the cruel, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Puzzling erdarbeiten
The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence on a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the country refuses to comment on that, nor does it controls.
Against midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli f-15 I fighter planes a mysteriöses, würfelförmiges buildings in Syria.
It is on the shores lie of the Euphrates; the next major city, 30 miles away, is dair as-saur.
Your name, in Documents to the International Atomic Energy Agency - IAEA - on Syria, when it comes to the reactor, allegedly with help from North Korea in the quader has built, hiding in a valley of the electricity does not have.
According to a briefing by the us-auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would be under the name of the Middle ortschaft el-kibar geläufige reactor has been well suited to produce plutonium - from the left to build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes, is hardly the technology from the fifties.
The CIA conducted a videopräsentation before with unscharfen satellitenbildern.
By computeranimation blendete where they should have been before the destruction of the components of the reactor, which fell a copy of North Korean model from the atomzentrum yongbyon was.
They also presented photos, the show from the vicinity of the building or even the innenraum.
The reactor had been just before the opening, it said, but not yet with brennstäben dispense have been.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more aware than at the time, the mystery has been increasing rather with time.
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs, reveals that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria is in el-kibar built a reactor, but hardly saw evidence that it was "an active's nuclear weapons programme" in the country.
Some geheimdienstler in Europe are there to even more cautious and speak only of a "alleged reactor," even if the cia-präsentation keep for "plausible."
They lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he is sure to have a reactor ahead, said a high un-diplomat only briefly in the summer, the IAEA have "enough material to questions to ask."
The rubble of the alleged "unused militärgebäudes created" the Syrians hastily to one side and planierten thoroughly the site.
However, took place in June 2008 iaea-team under the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was made by people.
Also received a Member State of the IAEA satellite commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack, which should be stronger than that presented by the CIA.
However, not to get these recordings on the market, because of the unknown principals - perhaps Israel - exclusively bought it.
Therefore the IAEA can verify their authenticity is not independent.
Syria has always claimed that never conducted a secret nuclear program or to have built a reactor.
The uranium come by the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But the, the IAEA after the analysis of the particles as unlikely back.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, as well as on the satellite.
Also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the ashes of the zerbombten building.
But Israel is staunchly silent.
"We will never comment on this," recently reaffirmed the official position of acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
So schleppt the investigation of the case since June 2008 without result out and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," such as allowing a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, after all, is a serious violation of the NPT in the room watching on the IAEA.
As the key to progress in the information, the IAEA apparently three more bodies, the "need to be in functional link" with the alleged reactor - and in a different way than this still exist.
In this context, the inspectors have so far not disclosed to the facilities it is, or what role they have or what they can appear suspicious.
According to information provided by the süddeutschen newspaper, they will be in the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah described, in turn, derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington - isis - has identified these places and on satellitenbildern a gebäudekomplex in masyaf located in which it is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is probably in or directly, in addition to a base - just with this statement denied Syria the IAEA access to the three places.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians were a fishing expedition - that the IAEA by the United States vorgeschickt will to militäranlagen auszuspähen.
Because the nukleardetektive were by a tipp the us-geheimdienste become aware of the institutions.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellitenfotos that between the three places and the quader lie on the Euphrates material has been moved back.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the sites could "in connection with the brennstoffproduktion are."
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reaktortyp will be operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, to this central issues, there are at most plausible suspicions.
What is also unclear is whether pieces of debris, the valuable traces mountains could have been stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of lastwagenladungen disappeared from the ground, nobody wants to have information on where the rubble has remained.
Only a few kilometres from el-kibar, on the other hand, lie of the Euphrates, salzmine al-tibni that Syria has investigated their competence in 1998 as a camp for radioactive waste, the IAEA as is unlikely.
The former iaea-inspektor Robert kelley it had in a recent analysis of satellitenbildern for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review brought in connection with the reactor.
Recordings from the orbit show, however, that Syria places in the three suspects erdarbeiten undertaking and remote large container after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but has done little to dispel the suspicions.
It is also in diplomatenkreisen, the IAEA have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections there that should allow it to Syria any militärgeheimnisse to maintain - alone the tape shows how big is the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte from this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna had contained a year ago that the reactor is destroyed, so the matter does not have a high level of urgency, brings about us-botschafter Glyn Davies since a few months' sonder-inspektionen into play, one of the harshest means that the Vienna atombehörde to enforce controls.
Iaea-chef yukiya amano of these inspections should propose an option of "has already spoken for which I am open in the future," but he does.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one it needs for a majority in the gouverneursrat of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are eager to anything other than an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat to are concerns: "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in times of war
Since angelina jolie in the summer with the work on their still nameless regiedebüt has begun, there is trouble.
The scenario has written they themselves, a liebesgeschichte between a woman from Bosnia and a Serb man.
Know much more about it, we do not, but even that is enough for unrest.
The rumour persists, the woman, a Muslim, verliebe during the jugoslawien-krieges in their Serbian rapists.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and some of the planned in Sarajevo drehtage were transferred to Hungary in the short term.
The film is now marginalised in Hungary and in the postproduktion, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira hasecic female casualties from the organization wrote about the un-flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR to jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported, jolie is even Ambassador of un-flüchtlingshilfswerks.
Diplomatically, it is not, it has been the women before weeks time offered a meeting in Hungary, but what the rejected.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, hasecic.
Liebesgeschichten in vergewaltigungscamps have not been it, and jolies attitude towards the victims will her enough about the scenario.
Her organization has the un-flüchtlingshilfswerk according to recommended that jolie as Ambassador to be released, The Guardian reported.
But what exactly has jolie written for scenes?
The Bosnian kulturministerium, which has had to read their scenario after some and forth a drehgenehmigung given for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why jolie then was not yet.
The jungautorin themselves have claimed that they has no political intentions with her film, with a lot of trouble in the jugoslawien-konflikt incorporated, wants to show the terrible consequences of war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
The content but it remains vague.
So I have a second synopsis for film in the network, which then sounds quite different: The loving knew it before kriegsausbruch and meet again, when you, a Bosnian Muslim, is abducted in a Serbian camp, in which he works as a lively.
What is but sounds much different than the variant "rape victims verknallt in folterknecht."
That jolies film actually, even before the war begins, so much is safe.
The pressure on them, jolie, was "unfair and is based on fehlinformationen."
Now you can only be the hackers make peace by Hollywood: by the scenario, as has been so many before, put on the network illegally.

"This idea is sad and disappointing."
There are men such as Stephen mclarnon to occupy the issue in a positive way.
Mclarnon organised the "workingabroadexpo," a Mass, a rundumservice offers the issue of work abroad.

As it anfühlt TO BUILD SOMETHING else knows seán o 'donovan for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do more for the 29-jährigen engineer in Ireland, he works now on the construction in Germany with 15 Irish colleagues.
In gelsenkirchen they are just a modehaus high.
In January, it further after Hannover, Germany or Berlin, the next project.
His country is o 'donovan now only rarely, as it makes extraschichten to the credit for his house at home abbezahlen.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says as he enters for the first time on the threshold of his house after a long period of time.
"I should have money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am as well as never more."
He laughs move something and goes through ausgekühlte rooms.
The Small House is in a fine wohngegend with cared for vorgärten, in the einfahrten park big, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, o 'donovan bought the house for four years ago for euro 380 000 - 100 per cent kreditfinanziert.
"It was crazy times, it was easy money without a lot of questions," he says.
He is afraid that it could go wrong with the credit?
O 'donovan considered hot tea after a while, forever and says,' I have no children, I must feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."

The demokatrische routine
The democracy in Latin America will be stronger as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than the unemployment.
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results, the latinobarómetro-umfrage carried out in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey will be carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the meinungswechsel in this region.
Fall two facts in this year's survey in September and October, particularly in's eye.
Firstly, the good mood in Latin America
And, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries of the South American pazifikküste has greatly increased the Democratic Movement - Table 1 - S..
In Peru, for example, where the economy growing at about 6% every year since 2002, the number of demokratiebefürworter of 40% in the year 2005 to 61% this year.
In Mexico, where the economy recovered since the sharp fall in the last year, is such a trend.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average - S. diagramm 2 -.
Some 44% of the respondents said that they be satisfied with the democratic practice in their own country. These are much like last year, but 25% more than in the year 2001 - diagramm 3 -.
About 34% of their country's confidence of the Congress and 45% of their government. Both figures are those of last year, but a sharp increase from 2003 show - 17% and 24% -.
A decade ago undermined Latin America's economic crisis the efforts to achieve more democracy.
That lasted this during the Great Depression, possibly because the countries of Latin America is only a brief rezessionsphase experienced and recover quickly.
Moreover, the poor were absorbed by a stronger sozialnetz.
- according to reports of the un-wirtschaftskommission for Latin America rose by this week in 2009, the armutsrate only slightly in Latin America and is again this year fell by 32% -.
But there are strong from country to country stimmungsunterschiede - S. diagramm 4 -.
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more felt and heinous crimes have increased, this is not the case.
Only the second time since umfragebeginn see many asked in Latin America in the crime in their country to have a bigger problem than in the unemployment - S. diagramm 5 -.
Some 31% say that either they themselves or a family member last year have been victims of a crime. but dropped to 38% in the last year, the values and consequently achieve the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the Greater support of the private and the market economy: around 71% of the respondents überregional said that the private sector is vital for the development in the year 2007, there were 56% - S. diagramm 6 -.
Some 58% said that only can bring their country progress to the market economy, compared with 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view - and 80% for a private sector -, even though their left President, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies.
Brazil has according to 19% of the respondents - 18% last year - the greatest weight in the region, followed by the United States - 9%, unchanged since last year - and Venezuela - 9% compared with 11% in the last year -.
The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua will be followed by Venezuela.
A wahlschlappe
No one had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts, the fears of the polling stations, the aid to the troubled country eilten, by far.
Overcrowded boxes vote made on a number of occasions, wahlscheine in rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and were only a part of the problems of intimidation.
Polling stations opened with stundenlanger late.
Many Haitians, many of which have been made homeless by the earthquake in January, streiften umher in search of a choice.
Some finally gave in.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged pioneers, demanded the lifting of the election results as a result of alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmund mulet, the head of the UN Mission in Haiti, the election "as quite well in many aspects."
According to a cautious statement of observers of the Organization of American States and the caribbean Community "make these irregularities so serious they may be, the process is not necessarily void."
In other words, the show goes on.
The wahlbehörde, which supposedly the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jew célestin is obliged, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected stichwahl is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap-musiker Michel martelly and the former first-lady mirlande manigat, have their initial ungültigkeitsklage withdrawn.
If Jewish célestin, in the voters will receive little or no approval from the wahlberhörde declared the winner of the run-off, this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera-epidemie and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, was feared a low turnout.
On election day, many Haitians were hampered by a lack of organisation of the vote.
Shortly before wahlbeginn were around 250,000 identity cards, which are needed for election, not distributed yet.
There is a great deal at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti's.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy that their beliebtheitsrate drove to over 50% up by 20 points. This is the highest value since its election in 2007.
Whether it provides a reelection in the coming year, however, depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández kompromissbereiter than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who drew the economic policies, even after the election of his wife was often budgets on the tax revenue, the economic growth and inflation does not fully take into account.
This allowed the präsidentenpaar, the extraeinnahmen spend after its own views.
On paper, the fernández-regierung the majority in Congress in the last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further zerwürfnissen.
Some dissidents from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings - in which a different face had a member of Parliament and the Government of the other bribery bezichtigten - The Congress failed to pass the budget for 2011.
"I will not have a debate on it," the president.
The 2010 budget is now for the next year, which the President still has more opportunity to spend money according to its own views.
The economy is hot: It will probably grow by up to 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is z.z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - unions and wage demands - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the post in 2003, when Argentina was ridden by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the inflationssenkung.
He refused the cooperation with the IMF, singled out for the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and Census indec, which then the official inflationsstatistiken schönte.
Fernández can now a mäßigeren path?
It has called on the private sector and the trade union leader to talks.
And, according to official statements should be limited to 18% wage increases in the next year.
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have been a strong boost to the economy.
But the inflation undermined the wachstumsschub by a great devaluation in 2002.
Would probably Cristina Fernández For this reason, Argentina finanzwirtschaftlich back to join the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the Government an agreement with wertpapierinhabern, had rejected the previous rescheduling of the country in 2001.
Now appears Fernández to push for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere, always rejected.
But last month, the economy minister amado boudou known that the Fund in the drafting of a new national index of consumer prices will make "technical assistance." It is as this would be the first step towards the cleansing of the indec.
It is not known whether Fernández after the end of their term will be politically active without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, which has largely enough by the kirchnerismus.
If the Argentines in March from their return to their summer holidays, the wave of sympatie it was shown, abgeebbt.
If you would like to win another election, they must decide whether they quietly lifted many of her husband's political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are coming to slow a closer link to the mainland.
What is Taiwan across the Strait by his Big Brother?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of voters, in order to be in the five Kardzhali mayors and to elect councillors. This is as a broad assessment of the President Ma ying-jeou interpreted.
By the groundbreaking construction business ties, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, ma itself is a symbolfigur has its policy for the relations with the mainland. the relationship to the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949 lasting changes.
Ma has passed the examination, but only just.
Though his kuomintang-partei - KMT - three of the five mayor is, they received no majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party - DPP -, which supports a greater independence of Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election would have this means for Ma problems.
Since his election two years ago, the support of his party fell by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even drew together with the KMT in the councillors.
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as lastwagenkonvois with krawallmachern, flaggen-schwenkende massenumzüge and A only scantily clad tänzerinnen.
There were even the compulsory, mysterious mordversuch.
Sean lien, the son of lien Chan and the KMT ehrenvorsitzender held on the eve of the election of a speech to a kmt-kandidaten,
As him a man from the amount of sitting in the face. lien was wounded and a umstehender spectators killed.
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidates.
Regardless of the attack, according to tsai ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the election affected put in a bad light and the DPP, which has brought more votes to the KMT.
It may be that China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, was not addressed the relations with the mainland.
Instead, the candidates under debate on plans to housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese people love their de facto independence, and China's militärbedrohung from.
For this reason, the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing does not want to be in the forefront.
But this time also avoided the DPP, the anti-chinesischen feelings to stir up too much.
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive.
Ma, I would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese supported its policy towards China.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan with economic incentives in the Community zurückzulocken.
China immediately sent a negotiators to Taipei, in order to prepare for a summit to investment and health cooperation.
Certainly it wants a political integration. But the most important thing first.
It is prefer it until after the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has reinvented now.
Two years ago it was severely weakened, the former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 until 2008, he strongly for the complete independence.
But under tais regentschaft developed a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of working and the youth.
Tsai took place as the DPP präsidentschaftskandidatin great support, as Su tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that they, too, is in a position to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a ideenschmiede as kontaktpunkt between the DPP and China. But this is vorurteilsfreie discussions ahead.
Tsai declared publicly that their party to offer a "trustworthy alternative" Ma's vorschneller rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell, he said the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He urged the pragmatists su even to the präsidentschaftskandidatur to abandon.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is difficult to choose their potential candidates.
The KMT will own a selbstanalyse must undergo.
Ma's values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth, the kmt-kandidaten wanted to lead their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unbeliebtheit unemployment and the always seem to be further gap between rich and poor.
According to a kmt-sprechers he will transform his cabinet, as well as the local institutions.
A strong voice for the DPP suggests that Taiwan a rapprochement, if only limited support.
At the same time, see most of the Taiwanese as inevitable economic cooperation with China.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent kolumnisten," there is no more back already."

Mosque in temecula wins approval of the planungsausschusses
The construction of a mosque in temecula took place after a fünfstündigen, often heated public hearing the unanimous agreement of the local planungsausschusses.
Critics raised the project to promote both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But, according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, is the new religionszentrum the local regulations and will be a aesthetic blickfang.
"The project is supported by many good people - of Christians, Jews, bahais, and many others," said hadi nael, Chairman of the Islamic Centre of temecula valley on Thursday morning.

"It shows that there is justice."
"There are only a few opponents," he added, added.
"They are just very loud."
"wonderful people live in this valley."
The session began to 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the Centre lasted almost until midnight, with the voices on both sides, according to press-enterprise were fairly evenly distributed.
The debate was further led on the Web site of the newspaper.
"There is no more," America was a comment.
"It is a different planet of the Apes, and the freiheitsstatue is dead in the sand."

Arsen-resistente mikrobe could enable new forms of life on the Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bakterienart, including the arsenic can live opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on the Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists this unusual bakterium discovered here in the world, it is their view, a sign that a life without the elements deemed vital to date is possible.
"This body has two options."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"This makes it to something very special, although it almost a kind of 'alien' is a way of life," said Paul c.w. Davies, based of Arizona State University and co-autor of the report, which appears on Thursday in online-ausgabe the magazine Science.
So far, six main elements were regarded as vital - carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But, as the researchers herausfanden, increasing the bakterium in California mono lake then even further, if It has replaced by arsenic.
"Because one cannot help but wonder what else is still possible," said the co-autor Ariel's report that anbar based of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life because scientists need to live and see its forms, anbar.
The study is concerned with microbes that were found on the earth.
The announcement in a press conference that no details were announced the discovery, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report by the discovery außerirdischen life could act.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetensystemen organisms can set in motion with the help of other elements of biochemical processes, and that the 'standardelemente' which, in our opinion, are absolutely vital, are not necessarily firmly set," said Charles cockell, professor at the planetary and space sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the teams of researchers.
"This work is something new, because it shows that an element in basic biochemical processes and structures can be replaced by another," added cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa wolfe-simon from astrobiologischen NASA Institute, who led the study, chose the mono lake because of the high arsengehalts.
As arsenic and phosphorus chemical same, they are exposed to that microbes that both may be able to replace an element by the other.
"The giftigkeit of the arsens is above all to the fact that it is chemically similar as phosphorus."
"It is the organisms difficult to distinguish an element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic is different than phosphorus. It comes in the biochemisches system where it almost everything verschmiert," said anbar.
The researchers, the bakterium gfaj-1 a rising arsenkonzentration. It fit in and grew.
The mikrobe is growing phosphorus better, but that they can survive in the arsenic, shows that a arsen-basierte way of life, of course, can happen, either on the earth or on another planet or moon, on the arsenic happens more often.
According to Jamie S. Foster, dozentin for mikrobiologie at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new. But so far, there was still no functioning example.
Arsenic came in the early erdjahren more frequently, she says, That is why the science expected that early life have used it.
"That is reason to believe that life can have developed differently than in the early erdzeitalter," forster, which is not a member in wolfe-simons forschungsteam was.
The research was supported by NASA, the energieministerium and the national health authorities.
Rest of the stolen ausstellungshunde found in compton

Peek and rickard living in redding, were this weekend because of the akc/eukanuba national championship in Long Beach in the city because trace should participate in the competition.
As peek told The Times on Wednesday, should the other dogs in the days before the akc/eukanuba-show take part in other competitions.
Süd-kalifornien is a halt to the almost einmonatigen tour of the paares of hundeschau to hundeschau.
On Monday evening checkten is peek and rickard in the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their vans before their zimmerfenster.
They arrested three other dogs - a boxerwelpen, a parson russell terrier and a Brittany - with their motelzimmer.

The lion brüllt again after judicial approval of the mgm-umstrukturierung
After 18-month turbulence and uncertainties, mgm now finally a green light for a new start.
A new-yorker konkursrichter began on Thursday offiziel "prepare" gläuberplan from to wipe the debt to the tune of $5 billion and the 86-jährigen unterhaltungsunternehmen to pave the way for new films and fernsehshows.
According to the statements of Thursday the plan met the requirements of the us-konkursrechts so that the relaunch of mgm under the leadership of Gary barber and Roger birnbaum, the gründern stands in the way of entertainment spyglass, nothing more. barber and birnbaum the studio reduced something as hauptgeschäftsführer chair.
The mitarbeiterzahl will be reduced from over 400 to around 320.
For mgm Chapter 11 is in force in fact only if jpmorgan chase a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new mgm-produktionen has concluded.
At the moment, leads a consortium of the investmentbank worth $75 million the itself, the company. The funding is to stand by the middle of December.
The restructuring of the studios began in May 2009 with the mandate of the investmentbank moelis & CO2, the group's management, which fought/year with interest payments to the tune of $300 million to help in resolving their financial problems.

They also plan two films after "The small hobbit" in co-produktion with naysayers bros.
The studio needed to a separate bond between $265 million to $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which should be under the design by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl icahn, about 18% of the mgm-darlehens has financed, sought a merger of the studios with lions gate entertainment, whose main shareholder is he.
But the last negotiations between the two companies led to no result.

Police activities in China are soft
As a ausbildungsoffizier step tang shenbin on an urban place, revised its nervous subordinates and placed it with military authority and gedämpfter voice orders.
He wanted to that his female members of the chengguan - China's robust wächtern feared the urban order and contempt for their arbitrary raids that and their propensity for violence - Impress the spectators.
"Are!"
"Look in front."
"Just goes to show you," flüsterte it to them, "are as beautiful girls!"
Four girls, hardly the teenager-alter grow out, with white handschuhen and identical olivegrünen jacken and trousers were closed.
Four few black pumps were in gerader series.
Four proper hats were perfect with blau-weiß gestreiften dragged held hair.
"For me, you see an average from," said Mr tang contempt.
"models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to burnish the image of China's stadtinspektoren.
In a city, all new applicants must have a achieve tertiary qualifications.
Guangdong province, instead of the graugrünen a leuchtend blue uniform.
Wuhan in mittel-china violence replaced by niederstarren: 2009 umkreisten reportedly 50 officials a set of not properly imbisswagen and starrten operators in this after half an hour to einpackte and left the place.
Xindu, a stadtbezirk in chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women reinforce the urban polizeistreifen. They were special because of their aussehens selected their good figure, and their youth.
They are the grobschlächtigen police a weicheren, femininen give aspect.
But unfortunately there would also be scarlett johansson hardly succeed the bad image of the Chinese of these stadtkommandos have to improve.
With the right, so the critics.
Different from the police these officials must enforce the urban laws only with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008 beat officials in the province hubei a spectator to death, when this with his mobile phone filming it, as a protest against a dustbin niederschlugen.
In the last year, a schulungshandbuch stolen the officials in Beijing and published on the Internet. it described as criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year suffered a Shanghai wassermelonenhändler after a handgemenge with five officials gehirnverletzungen.
A against violence strotzendes videospiel that can be downloaded from the Internet, shows trained officials in China in an attack on straßenhändler.
"chengguan makes the fear of the government," lamentierte the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleansing."
Skeptics are the current approach is clearly inadequate.
As the distrik in October was sought by display eight female recruits, an editorial in the Beijing evening news the question of whether the women had real tasks or will only serve as optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to stellenanzeige were women between the ages of 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonious gesichtszügen sought."
They should be stronger than average size - on 1,5m or 5 feet 2 1/2 customs.
The job ends with achievement of 26 lebensjahres.
According to the officials, the work for women over 25 physically uncomfortable.
"The most important thing is their image," was a unbenannter distriktbeamter in the almost regierungs-webseite rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first of its external phenomenon, such as size, weight, gesichtszüge, and so on."
Then come temperament and "internal qualities."
"Female chengguan are like blumenvasen," he said and added, "but they also have other duties."
Zheng lihua, deputy head of the municipal council of the distrikts, would not agree with this description,
But were to that in China größenvorgaben in stellenanzeigen for both sex are not unusual.
The same is true for steady gesichtszüge.
Whether this is synonymous with look good, is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical detects corruption need not to apply.
"Here we can unfortunately, no lahmen or buckligen use," Mr Zheng.
"would not be good to their image."
Liu Yi on the baoguang-platz close to a monastery patroliert, 22, has apfelbäckchen and a well geformten mouths.
They empfindetes not as a sexist that placed great importance on their appearance.
"You find, I see in this uniform sexy?" asks them with a view ironischem.
Their colleague with the grübchen, the 21-jährige Xu Yang, noted," We have the responsibility to represent the image of the city."
According to her, the brief attitude does not regret it, because it is more ambitious karrierepläne had than simply traders by the gassen to scheuchen to it on geschäftemachen to prevent.
Every morning deals, the streife with some 12 straßenhändler trying to as many as possible on foot or on the bicycle bread roll and tofugerichte to sell before they fortgejagt.
"Mr Wang, they disappear ask here."
"We have told them that has often said." frl. Xu was a trader that fled on foot and in his on a fahrradkarre befestigten nudelküche had temporarily left in the lurch.
According to the women officials is the work is more repeating monotonously as troublesome.
"It is almost every day is the same," said Huang jing, 20, studied in the leisure vertriebswesen.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the dealers were not the female officials, as their male colleagues, can confiscate.
They can only be criminals to threaten them to report their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility, which are often exposed to officials in China.
This year, rioted outside hundreds of inhabitants of kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour kursierte, chengguan-beamte had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police officers and chenguan-beamte were injured in the night of the incident, 14 regierungsfahrzeuge have been undermined or set on fire.
Xindu remained of such gewaltausschreitungen spared so far.
But unrest are not carried out.
Only two blocks away from the calm baonguang-platz, in which the female official in this morning patroulierten, about 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had a use them confiscated, contrary to the rules on the pavement instead of in a werkstatt was repaired.
The owner said zeter and mordio.
After 15-minütigem hesitate bahnten officials with grimmigem face the path to their vehicles and drove to use them and continued its owner.
Li xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male streife, remained behind. He was in his white namensschild, in order to remain anonymous.
Play as their colleagues of the coordinators - men over 40 - purely a supporting role.
But they have not been trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally before."
"Sometimes but physically," said Mr Li austere.
"Most of the time to catch people with the dispute."
Prosecutor Senator will ensign not accusations
Prosecutors have the Ministry of Justice Senator John ensign acquitted by the accusations which, in his affaire with a former wahlhelferin and his attempt to give a lobbying to her husband, made against him, the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday announced.
This decision put an end to the worst rechtsvorwurf against Senator ensign, the Republicans from nevada. Until the scandal, the country was a setback for headlines, and his career, he was seen as a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator ensigns Office announced that he was "delighted" on the judgment after the year investigation.
The ethikkomitee of the Senate, however, could impose a disziplarstrafe.
After the statement of ensigns lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator ensign have been suspended and that there are no further accusations in this matter.
The Justice Ministry did not comment on the case.
The verdict was for many ethik-anwälte outside the Ministry of Justice of a surprise. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that ensign the lobbying-verbot has ignored.
Interviews, emails and other documents, which for the first time in October 2009 were revealed in the New York Times, gave rise to the suspicion that ensign Douglas hampton, one of its aid workers, helped to lucrative contracts to his silence on a affaire with hamptons wife cynthia to buy.
Cynthia hampton was during an election campaign ensigns as schatzmeisterin Act.
Ensign took to contact some of political friends to hampton to work them. According to the documents and interrogations he took after the attitude hamptons lobbying for them.
Since hampton recently, in ensigns wahlteam, it was he was no lobbying for a year for his former employer or take the whole of the Senate.
According to statement of ethik-experten into the unusual agreement between ensign and hampton before the affaire were closely friendly against known as the ban on the drehtür-lobbykratie.
According to the indicators published "it is apparently a consultation and the violation of the drehtür-statuten," Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer, who has specialised in the defence of clients, which are in their sights of the government.
While it officially rejected the Justice Ministry, the reasons for the decision in ensign-fall to be known, said Mr fire and other ethikanwälten, very careful notes in the Ministry include political accusations after a large number of defeats, which were followed with great interest by the media, including the decision last year that the charges against the former senator ted stevens to drop on the part of the Public Prosecutor for malpractice.
Prosecutors "are obviously schreckhaft," said melanie sloan, the chairman of the association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" - an organization whose goal is the fight against corruption in parliamentary and government circles of the United States - a group of lawyers of various accusations against Mr ensign has brought to court.
"This basically means that hochstehende government officials now can assume that the law did not apply to them," they added added.
Paul coggins, hauptverteidiger of Mr ensign, said in an interview that he had on Monday A telefonanruf received a public prosecutor and a further the next day, in which he was informed that the Ministry will make no complaints against his clients.
Mr ensigns defenders had cooperates with the prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated again in a statement on Wednesday, has "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr coggins refused, the legal arguments that he had made to the prosecutors to explain in detail.
"In my view, is not well in the gesprächsdetails between the Ministry of Justice and me to go. Just as much was said: we believe to have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the bundeswahlkommission decided to suspend the investigation because of a separate complaint by the Group on Ethics, after the a payment of $96,000 of Mr ensigns parents to the hamptons against the bundeswahlgesetz HAVE VIOLATED.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money would have been something else as a gift.
NV Energy, a major company in nevada, which supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies in which Mr hampton thanks to the help of Mr ensign lobbyisten-arbeit found.
An email from December 2008 shows that Mr, after the company hampton has moved as lobbyist forward, Mr ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a talk with Mr hampton had, in which he informed him that he "the Interior Minister because of a matter anklopfe."
Mr ensign was also with Mr hampton and other customers from nevada, allegiant air, agreed to lunch and asked the Transport Ministers to agree to a meeting on behalf of the airline, after these Mr hampton for lobbying had stopped.
As information on this affair to the public for the first time last year, to apologize Mr ensign in his voters and gave his position in the Senate, where he had been in the order of the Republicans in fourth place.
After he was caught not many months more, told Mr ensign two weeks ago told reporters that he should have a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr ensign no longer the aim of police investigation, said his pressesprecherin, jennifer Cooper, the senator hope that the give very quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and its investigation einstelle.
"Senator ensign is pleased to continue his hard work in the service of the people in nevada," she said.
Cheshire-berufung power at the Twitter attention
Half a dozen of them tippten way in the riots in the court.
In the minutentakt verschickten about Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies.
At the end, so the defense, there have been more than 140, 000 twitter-meldungen on the process for rape and beds gekettete children in a house on fire aufging.
On Thursday will be the process closely followed by Steven J. hayes, was accused of three members of a family cheshire, connecticut, to have killed a formal end to find if the richterspruch falls on the death sentence, the jury has spoken,.
But Mr hayes lawyers have already submitted requests in court to explain the reasons for appeal and will employ the courts for years.
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it by the intensive coverage of the process, by the extensive use of Twitter by durchschnittsreporter - a "zirkusatmosphäre" and a penetration to become so widespread aufrührerischer details had come, so that the jury had been influenced by the public indignation in an improper way.
This could appeal the appelationsgerichte lead to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules to be necessary in the court.
"As I have seen it during this process, I believe that it is really a threat if the entry of new technologies in the court, the right of each affected to a fair trial," said Thomas J. ullman, Mr hayes hauptverteidiger.
The presiding judge, jon C. blue by the Supreme kammergericht, warned last week of the requests by entscheid back In summary, when he said that the new media "would be" carefully controlled, and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, have gerichtseinsprüche noted that the reporting on famous cases can raise doubts about the fairness of a process.
In its historic decision of 1966, the verdict of the Supreme Court of the United States against Dr. Sam sheppard, a osteopathen from cleveland, is alleged to have killed his wife, lifted and said in his decision that it would have been a "karnevalsatmosphäre in the court" because of new media.
Some people believe that the fernsehserie and the spielfilm "on the run" based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that gerichtseinsprüche what Mr hayes condemnation should look to half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary in order to kommunikationswege from the Court, the time of the Iraq case, Dr sheppard were still inconceivable to rules.
"There is a good reason on the influence of the new media in trials, which will be followed by a wide public to be worried," said John J. donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, who has investigated the death penalty in connecticut. According to his report, it will arbitrarily imposed.
Professor donohue said, some appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction issued a prompt communication from the Court could make the fair trials.
The twitter-angelegenheit is only one of many of the lawyers of Mr hayes explain, in order to discuss for years and thus delaying a condemnation.
The defenders say, for example, that Mr hayes could have already been regarded with hostility under any circumstances, as Blue judges had not allowed them, the reactions of potential juroren to test by making them during the jurorenauswahl grausige tatortfotos showed.
Some of the juroren have said that photos of the victims, jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their tüchter, hayley, 17 years, and michaela, 11 years, they should have met with disgust.
The defenders say that they would verfassungsmäßigkeit Constitution of the death penalty in question, and argue that the judge mistakenly a juror have exchanged views, which would have been a critic of the prosecutor, and that it had improperly exerted pressure on the ruling when he had made the unusual decision to ask the jury of free over the weekend.
The juroren were not isolated.
But their arguments on the influence of the extensive reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest.
In a urteilsanfechtung, they have submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in connecticut and during the election campaign for the post of governor and was discussed by the candidate for the US Senate.
They argued that the new media constantly had reopened the flames of the emotions on the case.
"Such a daily andrang the medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the gerichtssaals," the lawyers wrote, "we previously has still not yet seen in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide."
Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some of the Journalists said that the claim that this direct news are aufwieglerischer as reports of the slow be reimbursed, a technikfeindlicher is a view that the reporting about future trials verarme.
But some lawyers said that appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technical change need the adaptation through the courts.
Mr hayers lawyers reinforce this claim.
Referred in their objection to the decision of the Supreme Court, 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr sheppard was lifted because of the reporting and made it clear that the New rules require new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Courtesy can connect the divisive?
After a campaign to schimpfwörtern and negativität is little courtesy of erupted in Washington this week.
It is the sign of a real zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before we quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress, no breakthrough in the big issues, with the one during the sog. "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a regierungsperiode, in which no more decisions are taken, had to employ.
After all what you hear, it was not a polite debate between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan punktesammelns.
The public meeting of the defizitkommission of the President on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members continue to exist.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months, can give a mutual respect of the ideological divide, which continue to separating the members of concealment.
This is hardly enough to say that there is a new era of cooperation here.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in of one of the other sign of cooperation and calls for compromise as they even tried to the borders of the public opinion and the patience of voters after a new parteienkriegsführung arbitration.
Therefore the meeting on Tuesday were itself and its assessment limited to a minimum of demands or accusations by the participants.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to be a rapid change in the atmosphere, which has dominated in the last two years, could expect.
Regardless of whether it to donate taxes, health or anwartschaften is concerned, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, the novemberwahl Washington at least for a short time voted mild.
"No question, that is the tone, a tone has changed," said pete wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center."
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections give parteiliche passion, which die once again.
And that is a good thing."
In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck session" are, Republicans and Democrats have no other choice than to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports the.
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all, whether it is now temporarily or permanently.
Also is a compromise on the increased arbeitslosengelder expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes that the recommendation that tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse A SUPPORT OF unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, the increased optimism that we in these issues during the "lame duck session" Some and at the same time can ratify the Treaty of New START.
But William glaston of the Brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties must, if the new 112. Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, is a phase of the nichtübereinstimmens likely, perhaps even inevitable.
Are done "after the things that need to be done, will turn this short psychology in confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical, and this skepticism is shared by many, the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see much of what happens from now on to 2012 as vorkampf, or schattenboxen, for the hauptereignis by 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the teeparty-wählern, were benefit their education.
How concerned the Republican leaders may also be that they too high pokern, you know that they have to try their promises to reduce the expenditure of the Government and the gesundheitsreform except to put into force, to be respected.
This parteilinien are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the defizitkommission clearly what a tax reform and the raising of some taxes and to increase the retirement age and include the reduction of government spending.
Alan Simpson and the deputy chairman erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so much insisted that the defizitfrage on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission, 14 of the 18 vote in order to make their plan to official recommendation and fight them very, in order to come only in the vicinity of this number.
The biggest opposition will take place in the elected representatives of the body because financial education, at least today, is little room or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress ahead.
The first fight next year will be in the form of parteizusammenstößen take place if the Republicans Obama in the staatshaushalts, challenging the taxes and the health system, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the bias of the current election, the majority of Americans still wishes that the two parties to work together.
If Confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, then both parties must carefully to ensure the public reaction.
Who is always destined to lose, will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
In fact, it may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization is now greater than in the middle of the 1990's, and they seem a greater ideological divide between Obama and the kongress-republikanern to be between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans than at the time.
At the same time, the activists from both parties see 2010 as a prelude to consequence for a much wider choice in 2012.
May be seen as the courtesy of this week to display will be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will require a lot more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that separate the two still.
Durchgesickertes us-dokument portrayed Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptokratie" and is a part of the bribes and the schutzgeldes, which they einsammelt, further to the Kremlin. As reported in February in a memo of the American Embassy in Russia.
Both the police and the staatssicherheitsdienst blackmail high protection money, so that they can keep their expensive living standards in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only of legitimate businesses, but also by organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has described as the authority "vertical" - takes its part of the money that the head up river.
The memo, which under the name of the Ambassador John beyrle was sent to Washington, was on Tuesday of WikiLeaks published on its website.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written, while yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was in October by President dmitry medvedev fired, but there is little evidence that in the meantime had been sorted out.
Luzhkov and his wife, yelena baturina, which has a known construction company, have for years korruptionsvorwürfe rejected again and again, and he has a lot of verleumdungsklagen won against such attacks.
In September, he said a Russian television when he was asked about a documentation, which suggests that he was corrupt," It is crazy, it is dreckig, it is dirty."
> an unbelievably large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The surveys have shown.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of ambassador, mentioned by individuals, and It is unheard, that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link with the crime of the Moscow government has led to some described it as" disturbed "and come to the conclusion that the government seems more like a kleptokrat is as a government," the memo.
"criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna "- a concept from the world of criminal/the mafia, which literally means" umbrella "or protection - with the police, the State Security - FSB -, dienstaufsichtsbehörde - mvd - and the Office of the Public Prosecutor, as well as covered by the whole of the Moscow regierungsbürokratie.
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, mvd and are on the second stage of the militia."
"The consequences of the ordinären criminal AND THE CRIMINAL inspectors at the lowest level."
"This is a inkompetentes system in the criminal groups close a gap in some areas, because the city is offering no aid."
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the biggest firms from and that the police arrested small businessmen.
A source, that is to say," said that Moscow's geschäftsinhaber understand that it is best to the protection of the mvd and to get FSB - and not the organised crime - because they have not only more weapons, resources and power as the criminal, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs is no longer asked as it used to be."
The memo pointed out that, while the collection of the money is comprehensive, not to protect itself be very modest; even the, the figures are sometimes arrested.
The figures who do not find their business very quickly closed before - because of one or the other vorwands.
Medvedev has talked about several times to fight corruption, but has said at the same time that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of the men with with koffern, probably were fully with money to go in the Kremlin.
"in its fight against corruption must medvedev relying on the bureaucrats," said georgy satarov, Director of by, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview.
"But he is part of the bureaucracy."
"It is not a part of the political class, because of a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, estimated by Russia corruption costs more than $300 billion a year.
The country is a recent investigation on 154 square to global perception of corruption by the organisation of NGOs transparence internationally - countries of "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt" list -.
The unveiling of the American Embassy memos what happened late at night after Moscow time, is certain to cause offense within the Russian government, although when Luzhkov can be blamed for the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to say that one of the problems löse.
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin claimed that the wikileaks-dokumente could be a forgery, and reacted furiously to the unveiling that American diplomats him batman and medvedev Robin have mentioned.
"The truth is that it comes to our interaction, which is an important factor of the domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would not have expected that this happened with such a arrogance, with such a pressure and in a way as unethical, you know."

Illuminated in a weak, betonierten klassenraum with dirty and abblätternden walls, is the director of the anlong veng high school to the man, who has built it in the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta mok.
"Everyone here loves TA mok."
"He was a good leader and he has thought about its people," said sreng kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, known as "The schlachter," remains the commander in this remote former Rouge rouge-hochburg in northwest Cambodia's popular, where he has built hospitals and bridges, developing the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the Government, long supporters in anlong veng challenged.
In April, allowed a local truth and versöhnungsforum the victims of the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government schulbuch that, for the first time, children of former soldiers tells the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a gemeinschaftstribunal the UN and Cambodia's for the first time, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, as the former leader of the notorious Tuol sleng folterkammer, kaing khek iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the veterans fear under the Khmer Rouge alnlong vengs, Cambodia's overshadowed their efforts to achieve reconciliation and reintegration into the society.
"There are still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they do not have the power to do anything," said chhang youk, director of dokumentationszentrums of Cambodia's, an independent organization that studied the regime.
"For them it was glorious life under the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It is dividing even families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of diseases, review or from hunger.
As the Vietnamese, causing the pole in 1979 pot-ied government, fled the remnant of the regime and its military on the border of Cambodia's to Thailand.
Widespread here until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary guerillakrieg resulted from their base in the west of mountains and jungles of Cambodia, drew TA mok the next generation in anlong veng approach.
But in the 1990s, as promoted by the UN peace agreement led to the first democratic elections in the country in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge militants began to joining the Government, which the kapitulationen Ieng Sary in 1996 and nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan has resulted in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta mok was had not given in 1999 by government forces in the dangrek mountains arrested.
He died in prison in 2006 of Phnom Penh, where he was awaiting his trial.
Fled as their benefactors you no longer protected, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters in the zermürbende of Cambodia's rural poverty and many retained the movement in nostalgic memories.
Even if a few elite official of the Khmer Rouge retained their local government posts because they have their weapons niederlegten, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, ignorant farmers.
"These people have very little benefited from the capitulation," said sok leang by the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which in the whole of Cambodia, in anlong veng thinks that public forums
"They are enshrined in the utopian agrarideologie of the regime."
"They grew without any berufswissen on."
Sor Lim, 55 years, the 1974 as a teenager in the rhmer Rouge had joined, fought in the jungle to anlang veng before it in 1998 niederließ to a life as poor reisbauer to lead.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"ta mok has always been something to eat."
"But now the life is difficult, because we have to take care of our own."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also concerns here wachgerufen.
Early next year, the Court will try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers to put them on trial.
The task of the Court of the old leaders and to condemn those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond the four cases.
That has done little to fears in anlong veng to alleviate.
Current medienspekulationen have on the chaem, 64 years, concentrated during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s, distriktchefin in the province manteay meanchey had been.
2007 it had charged the dokumentationszentrums told of Cambodia, they have the construction of the trapeang thma damms led, a project in which thousands of zwangsarbeitern probably died.
On a hot evening came in the chaem from work in the fields to their holzhaus in a dirty streets outside of anlong veng back.
As the sun for a long shadow on the verdorrte grass accused rejected in chaem it refused to talk about their past in the Khmer Rouge.
The court should it flows, so they would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"There would be no more prosecutions, would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, fled by the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the Court would bring more suspects, although experts and historians to discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to move forward, said chhang youk from dokumentationszentrum.
"reconciliation with the khmer-zeiten means to collect the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put this broken parts together, so that as everything can understand."
The centre created the first approved by the Government schulbuch about the Khmer Rouge, which 75seitige "History of democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in anlong veng as Annex to the history book for the High School of the bildungsministeriums, which contains less than four sides on the Khmer Rouge.
How often know the young people in Cambodia in anlong veng only little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime.
Touch valeak, 19 years, a student in the anlong veng High School, said that the new schulbuch helps the students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted sceptical when he brought home with the book, in order to read it.
"My family rejected many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people be condemned by the court."
Such a resistance makes the complex and complicated process of reconciliation, said sok leang.
But the public forums, the schulbuch and get to the Court and to influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
High in the mountains dangrek leads a sträuchern überwucherter and with plastikmüll verdreckter path to a rechteck covered by black soot, with a rostigen blechdach.
Pol Pot's body was here after his death in 1998 on a reifenhaufen been burned.
Nuom sothea, 31 years, a handyverkäuferin on straßenrand, said she does not know much about the man had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here to go to him in order to pray," she said.
It was nuom sotheas birthday and later in the day they wanted to Pol Pot's last ruhestätte go where it is bananas for a mature Bush, in the hope that he will bring their luck.
Belarus is in agreement with this, not further waffenfähiges uranium anzusammeln
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the Government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels made known.
The US government had tried for years to persuade Belarus, not more highly enriched uranium to collect and seemed to have achieved a hurdle last spring.
But the US administration official told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two geheimabkommen with Belarus have been taken to 187 pounds waffenfähiges uranium from a Belarusian forschungsanstalt to remove.
That was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, about 500 pounds to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement is one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear sicherheitsgipfel Of the 47 nations" from April, the Belarus had ruled out.
And it was obvious good enough to the invitation of the former Soviet republic to ensure the next summit of 2012.
"I was really excited by the fact that they have a seat in the nuclear sicherheitsgipfel - from 2012 - like."
"This shows me that it works," said Ken luongo, President of the partnership of global security, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, within a period of four years to ensure all vulnerable nuclear material.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear sicherheitsgipfel Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never abandon its uranium.
"How to keep high enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos What is fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our resource... we will not make it dirty bombs and we will not sell it."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus approached yet a few months ago the United States, as it a agreement's interest in the meeting.
The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly difficult because the material easy contaminated by radiation was, official says.
It was in a spezialzug load, the more than 1,500 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, official says.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official by plane.
The US government pays $14 million for this effort, with a large part of the money in the Belarussian research flows with depleted uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This coordinated and was extremely careful" to build confidence, that led to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew bieniawski, a representative of the energieministeriums that in the global gefahrenreduzierung works.
The Centre for the James Martin nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Belarus at least 88 pounds in this year waffenfähhigen uranium had and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dissolve his camp by 2012, according to the common agreement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, first of all because of lukashenkos harsh abuse of human rights.
But the statement from Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement.
"Welcome the progress of this global security issues heißend, to give the United States of America and Belarus announced that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," it said.
No objections of the Spanish Government against cia-flüge
The Spanish Government had no objections to the cia-flüge with Taliban and al-qaida-gefangenen on Spanish territory to Guantanamo, as a telegramm of the Ambassador of the u.s.a. emerges in Madrid.
The, the WikiLeaks enhüllten and "to the daily newspaper El país" - a Cable - which reflect documents. They add that the former deputy regierungschefin María teresa Fernández de la vega demanded that the Spanish Government should be informed, "to show that foreign aircraft flying over the Spain to be properly monitored."

"They just want to be informed," to be surprised not "unprepared," reported aguirre by cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel Moratinos Ángel, the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish Government "would not pay great attention to this matter, even though the Government only have little influence, as this would be in the hands of judges."
The prosecutor was Vicente González, to understand the message in January 2007, the judicial initiative that he deklassifizierung the documents of the Spanish geheimdienstzentrale - cni - and the Defence Secretary on the cia-flüge to request would not block.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a meeting with the Public Prosecutor.
Still was the United States on The "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" concerned than about the deklassifizierte information to the cni and the Defense Department.
"This coordination between independent untersuchern will complicate our efforts towards the discreet handling between governments," complained aguirre.
During a lunch meeting in March 2007, in which the US ambassador and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez rubalcaba participated, commented on the latter that "although the Spanish judges are incredibly strong considered on its independence and do what they think is appropriate," he gave instructions to his staff to avoid "inflated rhetorical comments to wane to let the tension."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the pp in this matter.
"Despite its position in the proamerikanischen general our Experience teaches us that the pp will not doubt, from a reference that the government zapateros actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations have tolerated or deliberately ignored, capital that, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the Government of the United States," underscores it.
The kindsmörderin recognises that it had on the Internet about the "mühsal" complained of motherhood.

Later they mentioned a communication it has received just on the mobile phone: "I would like you to this month zurückkommst or I can give an address, in which I can send you the young."
They complained: "if it is not like that I put the young with my mother, hole I, if I am back from him."
In May, they talk of return to their village: "This week I will go there, but I will remain there only to 19, because I must present a work on 20 if I do not want to lose."
They said that their erstgeborenen mitnimmt, if all goes well.
"He will be in the, in the, that is to say, he must be with me. I will never live in let him back with anyone except for my mother," a dubious intention if we consider their bad relationship.

Party popular won 4 seats in Congress on this and psc lost 9
With the results of 28 November, could the pp in the cities lérida, tarragona and Barcelona play a crucial role
After the major stimmen- and abgeordnetenzuwachs at the last regional elections is the pp your eyes are already on the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. your expectations are more than positive, because the votes that this party achieved in these elections is normally twice as high as those in Catalonia in the elections.
The Catalan Popular Party received 610.473 votes in the legislative elections in 2008, while This paragraph in the regional elections in the year 2006, only 316.222 fraud.
On last Sunday reached the ppc 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - result of the diversion of stimmenanteils the psc and commitment on the part of the electorate of pp - should continue, the analysts predict the pp that, in the parliamentary elections, the ppc from 8 to 12 congressman could rise, while also ciu four - YOU, NOW 10 - before and the psc at least 9 members - 25 - would lose.
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for pp and psoe.
In accordance with the analysis of the People's Party would erc lose a member, currently has three, while icv could keep their members or a before.
Should the wahlkalender be maintained, however, is the next date with the local elections in May in 2011. Then, too, can the People's Party - pp - to be the voice of the scales in order to put an end to the Socialist domination, and in four provinzhauptstädten and emblematic with its majority in the City Council, one of the local municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the psc the cities of Barcelona, tarragona, lérida and gerona, in which the Socialists neither achieve a majority still on its traditional allies - erc and icv - can resort to lose.
It is not unreasonable that this party after the Republican debacle emblematic their representation in the local council in which they should reach 5% of the votes, will lose.
The pp, on the other hand, an increase of their stimmenanteils in the four provinzhauptstädten and could be the decisive force in Barcelona, lérida and tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the lead role in tarragonas change. There they had in the current mayor, Josep félix ballesteros, together with the pp ruled.
En lérida is the pp only 500 votes behind the psc. The mayor, àngel ros, maintains good relations with mariano rajoy - during the recent election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as in badalona, castelldefels or reus, the People's Party, there has been a significant increase.
Currently, the pp local municipalities in 34 of Catalonia represented and seeks the formation of lists in so many places as possible.
The Catalan cell worried Al Qaeda thousands of reisepässen
Apart from the seven arrests in Barcelona, there was another three in Thailand
The seven emblematic of the police officers of the police geheimdienststelle arrested Pakistanis and the Nigerians constituted the managed from Thailand dschihadistische cell, the different al qaida-gruppen, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" - LTTE - and "laschkar e-taiba" - let - - the latter was the author of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, the 2008 106 deaths, supplied with passports.
The Spanish Interior Minister has a great importance to these investigations, which so far is that he assured, with the "operation was kampai" The fälschungsapparat Al qaidas had been "weakened" in the world, and "so their ability to act."
The researchers are assuming that, in the two years, in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports have been sent to Thailand, where they falsified and then to the groups from which the criminal galaxie made Al Qaeda, have been sent to ensure that their "militants" have been able to cross the borders of European and other Western countries with impunity.
Tendency to blame cell is not the only of the jihadist network, which was active in Europe. Therefore, apart from the Thai untersuchungsorganen other European polizeieinheiten collaborated in the investigation. It is not unlikely that it in the area of the EU in the next few days to Similar atrocities such as the Last Tuesday was carried out in Barcelona, will come from.
In coordination with this operation - the Pakistanis junaid humayun, atiqur rehman, jabran asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad saddique Khan begum, tanveer arshad and the Nigerians babatunde agunbiade were arrested - has been carried out a further in Thailand, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad athar butt and zeeshan ehsan butt and the thailänder sirikanlaya kijbumrung have been arrested.
They had from Bangkok led the cell in Spain and other European countries niedergelassene.
The Catalan Network, has been a part of it was destroyed in the year 2009, steel especially tourists passports under the guidelines of what is known as the "International Islamic Front."
This means that the documents in the name of men to be issued at the age of 25 to 45 years and had to be valid several years; they were not permitted to visastempel levels.
In untersuchungskreisen is pointed out that until now, no links between the detainees in Catalonia and the attack could be proved in Mumbai, although the author of this attack," laschkar e-taiba "was one of the empfängergruppen of counterfeit passports stolen in Spain and then in Thailand.
Nevertheless should remember that a few days before the attack from Catalonia, by means of a geldtransfer-unternehmens several thousand dollars had been sent in the purchase of prepaid-karten were "invested" for mobile phones, the later by the members of the "commandos" was an end to the life of 106 people, have been used.
The police has seized an extensive documentation.
Pp of Ma's calling for a postponement of the steuervereinbarung
The Chairman of the ppc, alicia sánchez-camacho, yesterday took the opportunity artur Ma's personally their conditions to support his amtsantritts as prime minister of the generalitat present. These are not different from the already raised during the election campaign, and may be with the prevailing of economic wiederaufschwungs and the failure of regionalistischen unabhängigkeitsabenteuern, as a finanzausgleichsvereinbarung, the regionalistische summarise leaders trying to propose at the height of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan party did with the security of artur Ma's, which awarded her the 18 members, they had won last Sunday, a paragraph that is more than sufficient to essential to feel. As the candidate of the bürgerlich-regionalistischen party ciu is dependent on that at least one of the opposition parties in the vote in his office contains the voice.
The future alliances that the regionalisten want to reply in the next parliamentary elections in Congress, relies on a possible Entente with the pp from. the talks that on this time with the rest of the parteichefs leads, as but to Catalonia.
With regard to the leader of the ppc, these demands that to support the amtsantritts "All discourses concerning the Catalonia of sovereignty and independence" and an agreement on the adjustments are between the State and the Autonomous Region, just as in the Basque Country, and the leader of the ciu even wants to submit to a referendum, to be employed at the back.
Two political leaders is common that they exaggerated the political apparatus of the regionalverwaltung leaner and make the erbschafts- and geschenksteuer want to abolish.
Dealing with the details of the negotiations on the Office of Ma's from the ppc jordi cornet and dolors montserrat.
Ma's has already with Joaquim nadal - psc - - The - announced a tough opposition and Joan herrera - icv - taken. Today he is with Joan puigcercós - erc - Albert Rivera - ciutadans - and Joan laporta - solidaritat catalana - meet.
The altenpflegeheim confirmed that the deaths are not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the altenheims in olot do not rule out that their pfleger on 11 elderly people killed
The leaders of the altenpflegeheims la caritat in olot - gerona - gave a press conference yesterday, in which it pointed out what damage the criminal acts, Joan vila dilmés - the pfleger during his work at least eleven had killed old people, for which he was responsible, the institution had caused.
The head of the altenpflegeheims, Joan sala, came in support of his lawyer, Joan cañada on court and announced," La caritat would like to the responsible - for the deaths - accusations," but "the right and our haftungspflicht force us to accept the process and the civil liability."
The body must not only a social ansehensverlust accept, because it is the criminal acts of the pflegers had not found in time, but now a high entschädigungssumme figures of the rechtsvertretern of the families of the victims will be calculated.
Joan vila dilmé confessed that the first crime go back to August 2009 and that he had murdered further since then.
The judge ordered the exhumierung of eight bodies - former patients of altenpflegeheims - because he suspected that the deceased have personally investigated but no doctor by telephone the formalities because of their age and disease have been phased out.
The head of La caritat verneinte this point outright and stated that "lack of adequate measures keinerzeit might have been the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer of La caritat added that there is "no evidence in the legal dispute for negligent acts were a person other than the accused."
Already as "todesengel" getaufte confessed to 11 murders and declared the day before yesterday, the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second to have murdered the old lady.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime in which he had used a mix of various palliatives.
The head of La caritat said the access of the staff to the drugs is difficult to control.
The insulinspritzen and the beruhigungsmittelcocktail, the pfleger in six of the nine crimes committed, in order to liberate the patients with the death of their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory analysis will be whether vila is lying and for his first victims actually chose a less cruel death or whether it from within ausbrannte by showing them bleichlauge verabreichte, as he had done in three women according to the confession that he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La caritat is one the statements of the pflegers do not believe, even as the number of gestandenen murders, which could well be more. This attitude is justified that vila had made very different statements in court and that it does not make sense to change his approach after eight successful murders suddenly.
You say that you have you for this reason, and the information available to the scope of these incidents of the judiciary.
Drohgebärden of the European Central Bank - ECB -
Investors reacted strongly yesterday on the threat of the ECB President Trichet, warned that "the markets should our reaktionsvermögen not underestimate."
The risk premia of the euro-peripheriländer have increased dramatically and by more than 5% of the shares of European banks.
We should, however, can deceive the possibility that the ECB, the euro has appreciated in little points, not underestimate what led to concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, to the extent that he collapses in recovered again, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investors will not lose its fear for a long time.
A month ago today the European Central Bank asked us to our liquiditätmsaßnahmen to reverse that the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably has to make a number of times in the future, taking a step backwards.
The Bundesbank asked the beendung of the plan to buy sovereign debt, as they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquiditätsmaßnahmen. It should only be a einwöchiger permanent access should be maintained.
After the irland-krise, we expect that the current liquiditätsmaßnahmen "at least until March" extended and the quarterly contracts with unlimited access to the quartalsende to ensure liquidity be maintained until at least June.
We also expect that the programme to buy securities continued and a stärkendes signal will spend.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday back and if halstarrig insisted that we will liquiditätsmaßnahmen withdraw, Only God can help us.
As well as in the ezb-sitzung in May, in which the bank confirmed, the purchase of staatschuldpapieren does not need to be considered and then collapsed the markets, it could repeat history tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, they showed the teeth and on Wednesday said they have already bought a lot, and they provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday was the auction of a year staatstiteln rather weak in Portugal.
The state. Asset Management was only 500 million to 5,28% from to 750 million 4,81% in the previous auction.
However, the interest rates in Portugal by 30 basis points in the whole of the curve and exhaust so that a wahrnehmungsveränderung reflect the markets after the words of Trichet's.
In Ireland, the figures of the schuldenlochs of allied published and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is to about 10, 000 million in the short term and possible further estimated 15 000. There is time to February to obtain private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has totally lost its credibility after it had not identified the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are within the framework of the rettungsplans acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the government must receive the parliamentary approval of his new budget next Tuesday. as it is still does not have the sufficient support Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has its discourse with regard to the Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December designed moderate. There political unity is asked to show that we are together the same partitur play.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries of the ninth sinfonie Beethoven's.
The Spanish regierungspräsident asked yesterday the plan of action, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as in the financial institutions, reducing the deficit, liberalization, privatization and arbeitsbeschaffungsmaßnahmen. The measures in the ears of the investors such as vivaldis sound four seasons.
The doppeleffekt Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
In comparison with the February was the reaction of the government and the Spanish Central Bank quickly and convincingly, and we will benefit from the überraschungseffekt.
Today there is a crucial auction of a three years staatsanleihe the benefits from the trichet-effekt will draw. Therefore, we are a strong demand, the doubts about all of our umschuldungsfähigkeit will eliminate.
For Spain would be the request for a hilfsplans a selbstaufopferung.
We would receive liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has available to 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. The terminate interest rates are very expensive and would have access to the markets without any notice closed.
Nevertheless, our strategy should comply with the motto of women cäsars: "Now is not only that, but also the appearance."
Only courage, we create.
The CEO of eulen fechtet at the request of his children, the gesellschafterversammlung of vega sicilia to
The storm in the Álvarez family open conflict, owner of the societies eulen and El enebro, flaut not from.
David Álvarez, founder of the unternehmensgurppe, the gesellschafterversammlung of El enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on 16, to challenge because he believes it to "absolutely Void." his children are trying to obtain a majority, of the bodies of the company - winner of the weinguts bodegas vega sicilia - to control.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José put the legal measures for a new justizkapitel in their dispute over the control of part of the group.
The founder of the biggest holdings for unternehmensdienstleistungen does not seem to be prepared, in his legal dispute on the control of the institutions of El enebro irresistible.
From the board, he was from five of his seven children herausgetrieben. This is appointed to the aktionärsversammlung of 18 January this year in the handelsregister is already registered as a contest to verwaltungsratsmitgliedern.
The gesellschafterversammlung of El enebro by the judges of the handelsgerichts number 2 in Madrid was called for 16, has a new donnerschlag caused in the lap of the family Álvarez.
The appeals to the judge is the only legal way, the announcement of the Assembly of the scheduling of the gesellschafterversammlung guaranteed.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, emilio Marta y elvira álvarez mezquiriz will of David álvarez as "a desperate means of applicants, his five children, designed to use legal technicalities, fraudulent schemes and rechtsmissbrauch recognise the Assembly for declared void of 18 January to let ', as official spokesman explained.
This argument is the basis for the challenges to the Assembly after the event, in order to explain them as "absolutely Void."
The same protagonists in discrete silence tried already unsuccessful in June, to richterlichem way to convene an assembly.
In El enebro - vermögensgesellschaft and holders of bodegas vega sicilia, among other assets - control David álvarez 'seven children of 100 percent of the capital.
However, calls for the founder of the dienstleistungsgruppe according to familienprotokollen 51% of the capital on the right of use.
This is the real thing on the background of the judges in the hearing for the treatment of the challenge, for which no date has yet been set to decide.
Red bull Triumphs in the f1 with a geheimwaffe of Siemens
The car will be improved with a software in real time.
Since red bull in 2004 in the world of Formula 1 eindrang is the speed of their history in this fine universe surprises and be marked.
Initially, no one paid the neuling attention and despite his sharply rising background during the last saisons, the endspurt last November, all on the victory of the ferraris of Fernando alonso.
Without the skills of the German pilots and weltmeisters sebastian vettel or the leistungsstärke to want to reduce the motors of Renault is the "geheimwaffe," which the multinational firm Siemens red bull presented in the hands and that a siegerteam created to become legend.
In reality is a powerful software to simulation of processes, the purposes of the German company in 2007, not with autorennen, have to do on the market.
This as plm called informatikprogramm was for the development of montageketten in factories around the world, energiewerken and precise instruments used.
Aim for a faithful reproduction or simulation a product or process before this is actually built, so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs.
Plm, the development of the cameras of canon, the aircraft of sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles of nissan easier.
Siegfried russwurm, head of the industrieabteilung of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the formula 1 - factory red bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the amendments and improvements in the race and can be found in the tests, design and implement them.
Russwurm leads from that in 1992 in the rennställen an average of ten technicians working could introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
In red bulls team today are 180 highly qualified young people work. with powerful edv-anlagen they lead analyses and all kinds of changes to the rennwagen through.
The siemens-manager stated that the plm-software is in a position to all parts of rennwagen of red bull to analyze and improve, with the exception of the motors, responsible for the only Renault said.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamik and the safety elements will be changed.
The changes can thanks to advanced production facilities and hightech-autoklaven in less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulators be transferred in the reality of the situation.
The only border this mad technical perfektionismus is set, the Formula 1 40 million dollars, the A - team for his race can spend in a season.
Red bull has its hightech-fabrik for the development and production of its rennwagen built 50 kilometres from London in a remote place.
It is two buildings in which visits, particularly of journalists, are severely limited.
All what happens there is top secret.
The workforce consists of 580 people, including the two pilots, The World Champion vettel and Mark webber.
But red bulls true Formula 1 - hero is zweifelslos the latest world champion sebastian vetell.
Behind the huge technological resources the energy-drink-hersteller in the services of its participation in the rennstrecken there is other protagonists, whose support priceless and their bekanntheit is zero.
The technologichef of the plant, Steve nevey, stressed that, five years ago, you could say that the progress in the field of R&E for rennwagen contributed with 50% for the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the anteilswerte changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey recognises that vettel and webber never by edv can be replaced because they "are not voraussagbare gladiatoren."

Sabadell wants his rivals in three years to steal millions of customers "
The Executive Director of banco sabadell, Jaime guardiola is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but rejects, first of all a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the schuldenkriegs.
Nevertheless he sees a slump in the zinsspannen advance the banks with increases of the charges and try to offset the price for loans.
Sabadell expected in three years, a million retail escaped, reached a still existing.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years, and to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will be a new one in 2011 dreijahresleitplan introduce.
The goal is not just to survive without the support from the public frob entitled to take, but also the market share for a million Retail - 700 000, if we withdraw the clients, the bank will lose - to increase. That is the great challenge before this bank is, because until now, it has its geschäftskunden more attention than their retail.
This year it has 250, 000 retail and 50 000 companies hinzubekommen.
Its market share in retail is at 3.5 percent, while the geschäftskunden represent more than 10 percent.
Another principle of geschäftsplans 2011-2013 is the increase in the productivity, or austerität, kostenreduktion. It faces the challenges that the bank, it will, together with jahresabschlussbericht imagine.
Only a few banks dare to set goals and to publish it in these difficult times, as all the plans of the banks have been confused by the financial crisis worldwide.
Sabadell will this year in their four years ago set leitplan optima conclude. This was initially designed to three years, but as a result of the market situation, he was extended for a financial year.
The customers who will leave the building societies, are the main objective of the bank.
In one of the apie organised breakfast stressed guardiola, 2011 would have a "difficult" year "with great scope."
The manager is considered that Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult" to create "work in two or three years," essential for the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war to liabilities, the zinsmargen punished - will wane, the risikozuschläge, the banks and building societies have to pay for their emissions to the conservation of liquidity, as a compensation for waning profit margins already shifted to the price of loans.
"The liquidity and financing issues are a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We do not have the Hahn marginalised, but the zinsdifferenziale are very high," was guardiola.
Banesto was already the order on Thursday in their filialnetz from restricting the allocation of long term loans and the zinsdifferenziale to increase - vgl. cinco días on 22 and 27 November -.
Of the managers, also a, the banks currently pursued the stategie to increase "the charges," but "within a framework of competition obedience."
Sabadells leitplan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
Not for nothing, he assured that in Spain," bigger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year will change everything," he assured.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "enormous" and does not exclude the possibility that some of the Spanish financial institutions in red figures abrutschen.
He is of the opinion that the frob could replace the monetary market on kaptitalaufstockungen.
After he assured that sabadell could survive a temporary closure of the markets, it weakens the argument of bankers, already predict a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing can be put in circulation, but in contrast to the incidents in June, could be short on funding repogeschäfte REACH and to deal with the crisis.
Ceca excludes the possibility of a second wave of mergers of Savings Banks
The Director General of the ceca, José Antonio olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday the possibility that it could come to a wave of mergers of Savings Banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
When the Spanish konzentrationsprozess savings banks began, there were several savings banks to take part in the first phase. they retained the second round.
On the other hand, assured the Director General of the Spanish sparkassenverbandes - ceca - José Antonio olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the merger is completed. The inclusion of cajasol in the group banca cívica cannot be considered a second round, it was far more adjustments."
"The biggest part is closed. It may be that we instead of siebzehen 13 or 14, but all important processes are already complete. they were of banco de españa, which has strongly supported all transactions, controlled."
On one of the Association of Directors and managers aragoniens - adea - organised breakfast led olavarrieta from that of the konzentrationsprozess "was taken as soon as possible and that we have to be satisfied with the process after time in previous times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with banco de españa was set," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28, 000 million vermögensbestand to 17 with the 75 500 million is a historic unvergleichbarer process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much more that what we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he pointed out.
Olavarrieta said, "There are a number unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, the unseriösität and absurdity of revealed" because "banco de españa warned us to complete before the end of the year on time."
The Director General of the ceca, José Antonio olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain is one of the rigorosesten finanzierungssysteme Europe and "may have" all over the world, and added that those who anzweifeltenn would do so "without deeper knowledge."
The managers said that we in the current wirtschaftskonjunktur "not concerned" about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks must make a "very significant" konzentrationsprozess have gone through, "will happen as soon as possible."
He also pointed out that the Spanish banks the stress tests, the ECB had conducted in July, were very good.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has for the beibehalt decided of the euro, but at the same time to set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tension in the markets have triggered a double response of the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero presented new adaptation measures, starting with steuerermäßigungen for small and micro, the regulation of zeitarbeitsunternehmen or the lifting of the 426 euro support for the unemployed, take the no arbeitslosengeld, through to the privatisation of 49% of aena, the management of airports barajas and El prat and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, supports the Deputy regierungschefin, Mrs salgado, with the help of the former regierungspräsidenten Felipe González criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis herausbeschwört have.
How are these transactions to understand?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro.
It is Germany a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, which is at odds with the maintenance of the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of opposition in Europe it begins in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis spekuliern.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area.
The second: the reintroduction of the German mark, although this sounds currently more according to science fiction, supported by a majority of public opinion, around 50 percent of the population.
The third: a transformation of the euro under German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict management; punishment of the countries that the cross targets; möglichereweise the zahlungseinstellung some countries and the extension of the costs of potential measures on the private sector.
The German position is clear and is already on for some time. Therefore, there is no excuses now.
First in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits were a constitutional reform and the German government come up with, in order to prevent this from 2016.
It was the first signs of the auseinanderdriften between what Germany is necessary - Strict steuerpläne and stable public finances - and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign, the Central European country, as Merkel to rescue the decision of Greece painful hinausschob.
At the time it was heavily criticised. but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, Merkel in the last oktobertagen with a clear position of the new. It calls for a reform of the agreement of the European Union, in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, the private darlehensgeber to commit a bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since they irlandkrise and everything on the following.
But their proposal, if somewhat sweetened, has been approved. In the next few months, we will be in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures as of 2013, participate.
Germany has drawn a red line which does not to exceed it.
It says all that, even if now unpopular measures must be taken, as of this date, there will no longer be the old functioning of the euro.
In 2013, the geburtsjahr be a new currency zone, in which the zuwiderhandelnden countries be severely punished, can be forced to explain to go bankrupt and in this case the private sector must take a part of the cost.
Germany shows that we have a hard wachstumskurs need to take, with high savings and investitionsraten, moderation of consumption, improving the productivity and competitiveness, and positive external salden.
The other option on the debt and construction industry with huge löchern based in the balance of payments, as it was mentioned in boom times by Spain, simply will not be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad, not to understand it.
It is not just a question of the deficit to three percent by the year 2013 runterzufahren.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst of what we could do in these circumstances is ourselves to cheat.
I hope that the current turmoil in move more calm.
And be given the opportunities, the US, that we will use by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this so well and the announcement of his double - the promised reforms last Saturday after the meeting with the companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday - points out that the hypothesis, despite the criticism of Merkel to create its own house in order, has caused their way.
But the Red line drawn by Germany is there, and it is not so that it would change things.
Under the opportunities in the consideration is that we fully the countries with little serious gestopften euro area to leave, not be ruled out.
In this case, Germany could still tell us we have warned us.
Sport and regelumgehung
Tricks like the alonso and Ramos in the game against the ajax show erfindungsgeist, but not the will to avoid a sanction.
The supposedly of two players of Real Madrid - xabi alonso and Sergio Ramos - angezettelte exclusion in the game of 23 November against the ajax led to a lot of ink in the Champions League was spilled about whether it is a unsportliche Act was or not and whether any both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before spielende - their team had already clearly won - time and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as the Real Madrid would give his group, the two players of the mandatory sanction the next ligaspiel against the auxerre meet and embark on the next spielphase without cards.
Finally, the disziplinarkommitee the UEFA, the coach of the clubs, José mourinho, with two to play and the players involved with different amount of money.
The provocation of a yellow card is not a new practice in such or similar circumstances, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport befolgten rules.
Part of that debate set forth in the case is back to that that a team of Real Madrid club - the anthem in his edelmut and honour and provides its players had punished for similar incidents in other occasions - and played the lead role, and on the dramatisierung by mourinho more of an episode of its long history as theatralischer and provozierender technician has added.
In any case, is the debate about whether this not explicitly banned by the statutes behaviour is against the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions represent a regelumgehung. Indeed, this approach to the Statute of the sport, but seem to avoid its meaning.
In this matter should the sportsgeist damage caused to be studied.
The sportsgeist defended the physical integrity of the counterpart, an aspect that was not endangered by these acts, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified use from the gegenteam draw. This did not happen.
The paradox of the Act of Real Madrid players is that it does not coincide with what we usually under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly taken to avoid a penalty, but it should be as striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players waited, and happily took the sanction.
A different question is what kind of benefit of the zuwiderhandelnden from the deliberate fouls Drew.
This should be stressed that the rival has not been brought in a less favourable position still benefits for the gespielte game erheischt were because the obvious result of this action was that continue to play their own team with fewer players.
It is also no useful strategy for the next game because the club has not then on these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players of the next round of the Champions League spielphase without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game, begin.
But it is a long, uncertain Advantage to a certain extent, as the team could eventually retirement. the players also received a sanction with this approach and go on in the second kartenzyklus, in which it because of kartenanhäufung retiring with a card of less than in the first cycle.
So that it is not clear whether it really is an advantage.
Eventually put such procedures are not against the sportsgeist, which also includes strategic decisions, in order to benefit from the provisions of a maximum.
In this case the players wanted to avoid no sanction - this would really be a clear case of regelumgehung -, they wanted more to choose when they undergo this.
They took a strategic decision to avoid without a penalty or to flee before her.
Although the Border between imagination and regelumgebung blurred is, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it by two selbstausschlüsse was and because of the nature of the unprovoked regelübertragung.
The damage that was done by these acts of the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Angebotoffensive the kundenfang for gruppen-weihnachtsabendessen in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the kalenders this year is an avalanche of reservierungen fall on the days of 16 and 17 December.
Celebrate the employees paid themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
As the turrón and the weihnachtslotterie there are, in vorweihnachtszeit again gruppenabendessen, the gaststätten- and freizeitgewerbe emblematic bring oxygen. But as a result of the economic crisis to solve a preisoffensive from to the kundensegment escaped, which is the huge crowd: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on an mittag- or dinner, confirm the surveyed companies and associations.
So that the accounting is a bit more complicated, the calendar - being New Year's Eve falls on a Friday - all bestellungen drop in the week on 13 December, with the result of an avalanche of reservierungen of dinner in two spitzentager - the 16 and 17 - and almost no bestellungen in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have the gruppenabendessen from haushaltsgründen suspended.
In order to not have to abandon this tradition, many workers pay them out of their own pockets.
As the economy is always, it will be niedrigstpreise demanded confirms the Chairman of the gaststättengremiums of Barcelona, gaietà farràs.
The representative of the dachverbands dares not predict until now, as the holidays will be in this month.
"The people consider it 'tens of times before they Reserve."
"They would like to come, but they respect much on the prices," he said.
The business in which will go well," The Quality adds to offer good prices with a good service," he added, and calls to remind us that the customers to save in times of crisis, and that is why prices are most checked by 25 euros.
In a recent poll in various Central nearby restaurants, it turned out that the evening of 17 dezembers the supplier leads to collapse.
The group soteras says that the demand for this Friday, with the intention to spend less than 30 Euro would boom. The group has its menüs with komplettangeboten adapted to the cycle between 25 and 35 euros.
A leading group to another andilana, which has 16 hotels in the city - hostal de la rita, market, La fonda and others -, the eigentümlichkeit of kalenders too early reservierungen, even led from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to the vorjahrespreise with menüs for every taste of 19,95 to maintain EUR 30," he said.
In terms of grup, the El mussol, attic, ququ and you lose the optimism is not a total of 23 local charge after flourish again since the second quarter of the revenue and good, if concentrated on a few days prospects for the weihnachtsgeschäft just.
Sources of the group would point out that the 18 a überaktiver day with freundesgruppen, will be the Christmas vorfeiern.
The six gruppenmenüs was a weihnachtsmenü for EUR 30 or more than preishit added. One has the impression that the customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and, in turn, want more details, such as cava.
In some of the firms you see green sprossen sprießen why the employees be invited again. This gives the impression that the gruppenessen are once again on the rise.
From the dachverbands fecasarm - with associations such as the kneipen-, restaurant- and freizeitverband of Barcelona - familiar to the Deputy Chairman, enric gomà to to see the end of the tunnel and noted that the reservierungen as a whole are right "lively," although the customers' a maximum herausschlagen. "
The fun on celebration was not, however, decreased, regardless of who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme is a great deal of concern in the United States
Islamabad is faster than any other country since "nuclear weapons."
Revelations of WikiLeaks confirm relations between Pakistan and the Taliban.
Of the internetportal WikiLeaks revealed content of the correspondence between the American Embassy in Pakistan and the us-staatsabteilung confirmed what Washington is enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program.
On the margins of the informative and hefty details the documents on the content of the talks and offer the thinking of the accredited American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear security is not strengthened but, on the contrary," is waning," and that the unstable Asian country of more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhytmus produces than any other country."
The nature of the Pakistani atomic programme, in particular that the weapons are not put together, but their einzelteile are stored to hamper their destruction in a possible attack - put Washington sleepless nights.
Following risks include the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, on: "the proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area of the attacks of Taliban, the expected verstreuung of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The great personenzahl in the nukleararsenale and the raketenprogramme implies, will not only by the United States, but also from Russia more than ausufernd seen and reason to proceed with caution.
"Pakistan must strictly gläubiges staff to stop the surveillance of nuclear facilities, due to the low educational and cultural levels extremist organisations have more opportunities for people in nuclear or raketenprogrammen participate, to reklutieren," said the expert yuri korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with his American counterpart.
What is new in the Julian assanges internetportal hit documentation is that the cooperation between the United States and Pakistan decrease in terms of nuclear proliferation and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message, which describes the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," said: "There is often no transparency; on assistance offered We received no reply, or they will be rejected."
Confirmed in a different communication Peter lavoy, official of the state intelligence service for South Asia, that "despite the economic disaster of Pakistan nuclear weapons as soon as no other country produced."
The ambassador patterson asks Washington during a visit of the Supreme heeresleiters, General ashfaq kayani to clarify the "responsible" that "Pakistan's army its tacit überstützung stop terrorist groups."
On the hunt for WikiLeaks head
Obama will appoint a High responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf to prevent new revelations.
Interpol is a red warning for persecution and search of assange.
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founder, jullian assange, related, is a complicated maze, in which the only difficult situations to investigate.
Yesterday, Interpol was a "red" warning to "search and persecution" of assange.
However, it is not a traditional order to arrest.
In addition, it is not new, it dates from 20 November.
It has nothing to do with the recent disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States to do, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, which must put the Australians in Sweden.
The lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark stephens also assured that "The police knew where and how they contact with Mr assange could begin."
Already was the International Police Office with headquarters in Lyon on 20 - France - at the request of the Order of Sweden, but it was until yesterday after receiving power by the Swedish authorities have not made known.
So are the things. The 188 interpol-länder are dependent assange to identify and locate," to arrest him for the time being and hand them over."
Although Interpol the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning not to consider many Member States can impose the red warning according to the organization as a licence for a arrestierung, which must be carried out by the National Police, especially if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where assange is likely.
The approach of Europe is outraged assanges lawyers, the gestures published a letter in which they informed about this, that the 39-jährige founder of WikiLeaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also recall that assange requested the exit from Sweden and the staatsanwältin with the sagenumwobenen lavrentiy pavlovich beria, sicherheitschef compared by Stalin, which received the approval.
"This is like a hunting, not as a legal persecution," is charged in the letter.
While the world is seeking him, and his mother from Australia the innocence of its sohns claimed - does assange in an unknown location to, but not in silence.
On Monday he was the head of the magazine time by Skype of an unspecified location from an interview. during the conversation he requested the resignation of the staatssekretärin Hillary Clinton of the United States.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the order North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus against has violated international agreements signed by the United States, they should resign," he said.
His opinion was yesterday by the pressesekretär of the White House, Robert gibbs condemned, the request for resignation described as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not sure why we should attach importance to the opinion of a type with a Web site," he told the CNN station.
Obama himself has a high responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf, rusell travers, with the prevention of new dokumentenenthüllungen charged.
The attempt by the spokesman of the präsidenden Barack Obama, assange less attention, is in contrast to the opinions of the Conservative politicians and commentators say these days.
The congressman Peter King, from January of the Chair of the National sicherheitskommitee will lead of the House of Representatives, the staatsabteilung asked to investigate the possibility WikiLeaks to put on the list of terrorist organisations," to seize their money and each of support or to pursue a contribution."
Tom flanagan, Advisor of the Canadian President Stephen harper was actually went even further, and he had to have his statement, assange "withdrawal should be killed."
"Obama to turn it into a target and not bemanntes plane or So what use."
Who is not apologizing, Mike was huckabee, baptistischer Minister, former Governor of arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it has always been, in the Government Information durchsickern was that he is guilty of treason and all what is no execution is eiine to mild punishment," he told the fox station.
Puigcercós looking with a augenzwinkern to the carod close to peace in the erc
The Republican leader allows the party a secret VOTE ON HIS continuity in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the vollversammlungsprinzips.
Joan puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for this is the umpteenth time of internal turmoil in the ranks of the following the loss of 11 members and half of the popular vote richtungslosen erc from the way to go.
The leader is aware that his rücktrittsdrohung the close of former parteiführers Josep lluís carod-rovira is not enough. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is so weakened as their mentor itself and other former currents will spread, as he is not worried about the same.
Therefore tried the leader of esquerra with a augenzwinkern to win the new critics, which would secure its position before the next municipal elections.
For the beginning announced yesterday that the more than 200 Regional Council members of erc over his remain in office could express a secret.
With ballot papers, not with superior hand.

Such a blockade, which was announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators could on the vote of the Dream Act, law and other projects, such as the ratification of the new start-abkommens impact with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

Put the finger in the head with literature
The second round of the 'desire in the language of' was a walk, in which the participants for the strong narrative made
"with the sex in the language I do understand, but... the finger in the wound? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa valenzuela, the second round of the 'Los placeres de la lengua' should open a cycle of the spanischsprachige literature and on this occasion celebrated the untertitel your question used - to a different event was devoted to the sex in the language of the Round Table, they said -.

"brings us in difficulty," spuckte the Argentine schriftstellein sweet contrary to the public, which is mainly from young people zusammensetzte on the International Book Fair in Guadalajara - fil - met to that of marisol shultz moderierten round table to attend the valenzuela, Sergio ramírez, mayra montero and Luis García montero took part.
Luisa valenzuela read a text which they Gonzalo celorio devoted, and the shultz then marked as a great narrative. Luisa told in the first person and is a champion, which is on the search to know what is a "wound," and Doctor to a doctor, of which it is no answer, but evidence for the Guide receives its narrative.
The infektologen leaves convinced," Patience is not my strength, maybe that is my head."
Finally, after a frustrating rapprochement with the trauma theorists, of their middle of the breath raubte on the motion, and her but said that wound was not a scientific concept, enthült the psychoanalytiker the secret: "The wound Is this really open, the symbolic is the narbe."
The hauptfigur the narrative seufzt easier and that it includes "of the wound only learned that this really is open and does not exist." But It is convinced that the desire to confuse the language and its fall.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with two.
The nicaraguaner Sergio ramírez asked a entzückende narrative, which he called 'praise of the invention', and in the the finger in the wound was not mentioned, but will be discovered.
To statements to the magical realism he told of a famous zauberin, the emotion of the clouds, far gereiste men zurückbrachte or the virtue of a girl lost wiederherstellte. The narrative made a turnaround and reported of America, the great novel, which it from the start, not on its own chronisten lacked and he quoted bernal Díaz del Castillo, of the abundance of the eroberen told stories of criticism.
"Cervantes, invited the US all - the writer - spottete the mock witnesses, which appeared in the stories described as true, but in a different way, the history of America would never been told, with einbildungskraft, who was lost even the shame."
But he stands out," It is the mad and liar, the "best present the things, and there are coming closer to reality and lie to each other, where we no longer know to which side of the narrative is where the fictitious literature reached the summit.
He calls the indeed the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him, that to be what will be told."
As mayra montero was in the series, annotated and praised the writer of the diversity of the interpretations, to which the invitation of the fil had contributed to the Round Table 'the finger in the wound'.
The kubanerin and puertorikanerin devoted their contribution of the large wound of social violence, which affects their country, as all of Latin America, as a result of the fighting in the drugs trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poesie, good songs contain a tacit, not deliberately planned commitment," they said, after they had pointed out that literature is communication and engagement between the author and the readers how to build a "chemical reaction."
The evening decided the Spanish poet Luis García montero, whose contribution also "committed this finger of the writer in the wound of The Writer" hevorhob.
He said that, in a rapidly changing world of the intellectual habits and the control of awareness on dogmatismen aim and to forget," that behind every confirmation of a small No, and that behind every denial of a small yes."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and the reality, we must define: and define often means to put the nail in the head and to harass those who feel much more comfortable if it in the form of cartoons, in black and white, think in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful prefer the world in black and white einzuteilen said he and invited to do so to rediscover the meaning of the letter.
Romano is fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in endspielen, he has seen the and ABS in his career, but he played crucial games three times.
In the match between Santos laguna and Monterrey in the end game are also two different styles with set by their respective coaches, and their of her meeting gegensätzen is reflected in the results.

Of The Argentines, the second champion with the coin coverage, he is a step has lagged behind the winners and surprisingly with the same team consecutive endspiele fought.
The santistische stratege reached the first end game as coach of the 'torneo apertura 2002' when del morelia had to restrain in the hand with which he against toluca with 4-2 learned a great defeat; later, with the 'clausura 2003' he reached the decisive match that he also with 3-1 against rayados lost.
Already with Santos laguna on the 'torneo bicentenario 2010," in which you against Los diablos played, had to rubén again share a setback because the game with 2-2 against Los choriceros after 210 spielminuten began undecided, but take the penalty kick he came with 3-1 forward and had two options, losing his title, but ultimately missed three of his players of the eleven steps and the game did to a 4-3.
Rubén had already two endspiele with the diablos rojos and one with Monterrey, its major rivals, lost. so he would not be pursued by the accident again and get rid of the bad guys zauber in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he confirmed that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I would like to be champion, I do not want to break the statistics, that is my affection for a club for which I am hingebe and, therefore, the title will come to me, but what happened before, is the most important," commented on the steuermann when it lost on the endspiele asked.
The last end game is he still remained strong in the memory, he assured to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from this is that by the referee, not the end to act, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared to the line, the players, because the last time we were with two elfmetern already prepared to auszuscheiden, and I believe that this is a lesson to the game is not over, there is no cause for celebration."
To know that this series by elfmeterschießen could be decided not worry him, because he used his players," It will never be the elfmeterschießen arrive and that we would like to conclude in the regular spielzeit, but sometimes, there is no alternative and we must be prepared in the previous tournee we were prepared, but unfortunately we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of the severe anxiety or desire to keep the title already in the hands of the left us with something for this end game, and we hope that this time it will not come to this."
It is in romanso power, not only to be second champion and bring glory to cost of the title for the first time.

The new unit is no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new, the unity of the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean charest many observers call to the education of a public inquiry on this issue.
Robert dutil, Minister of Public Security, said that this idea come not from yesterday, Quebec would already have last January, the New York Department of investigation consulted on this issue.
The Metropolis has since 1870 about a possible unity against the corruption.
However, the announcement is more than just a surprise by Wednesday.
We have to say that this measure at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the quebecer police force on 29 October last year despite the presence of Robert dutils was not discussed at all.
Because it lacked also not Stéphane bergeron, critics and member of the parti québécois, this announcement in terms of Public Security as "out of the hat gezaubertes White Rabbit" and "in a tischende rightly gebastelte qualified solution."
Minister dutil had turned to those, in turn, the fear that the political power of too much influence on the question, can have a future unity.
"You will see the result if we will announce it," begnügte to confirm it.
"It is aware of this problem."
According to réjean parent, the President of the csq, nothing can replace the implementation of a public poll.
"The more M. charest insisted, want to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think that he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to be able to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean charest," said for his part, Yves boisvert, dozent for ethics and politiksysteme in the ena - staatl. University for the training of high verwaltungsbeamter -.
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposes the Quebec, the finanzprüfungskontrolle acknowledge a specific mandate so that they can make the appropriate checks on corruption and secret agreements.
"We should be able to extend the mandate of the prüfungskontrolle," he ruled.
He also believes that the Quebec of prüfungskontrolle could give the same authority as Commissioners, which would allow her to the people to commit to the statement.
The formation of the unity is not the only project in existence of the Government charest.
The Quebec will also demand of Ottawa, to amend the Penal Code to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This demand comes from the operation oberstaatsanwalt marteau, the Minister of Justice jean-marc fournier has informed that the administration of justice in this kind of prosecution is not clear.

450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-québec in mutual agreement projektplanungsfirmen 450 million dollars in contracts for the wasserkraftprojekt eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the firms bpr, dessau, Groupe sm and axor, which is the most important part projektleitung, has received a sum of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, known as the 'énergie gérance," has been in 2004 as a corollary of the decision of their responsibility to the private sector hydro-québec broken, this important hydroelectric project in the level of a sum of $5 billion to überantworten formed.
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium "énergie gérance" the lucrative Treaty without that it might have been a public tender.
For the parti québécois, the resort on unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem, that the risk of wettbewerbsverdrändung and evokes an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of abgekarteten game and refuted the competition."
"This means that we rather than fix games instead of in a secret way now carried out in open form," declared yesterday sylvain simard, member of the pq, at the press conference.
On early morning had simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems to understand him, such as the public interest in this way, can be served.
Ressourcenministerin nathalie normandeau had the afternoon responded to it by vehemently denied it was that this Treaty is a abgekartetes game would have acted.
"I remain faithful to my line," lashed out, by confirmed that the pq had acted "Dishonest" and it "lack of its severity."
They said that it "is the least" that the pq apologize.
The model of the consortium is standard practice in the world.
It is usually a time such a temporary alliance, which allowed two or more companies, their expertise known concerning a necessity for a tender for a complex project to join.
The project "eastmain" has a high komplexitätsniveau with regard to his arbeitsausmaßes.
The bauverfahren is under way and is to be set up by 2012.
However, the Treaty was awarded without a competition had can take place; it had already been negotiations.
The model of the consortium is also in Quebec Even with relatively simple projects no longer an exception.
As the newspaper "Le devoir noted" last week, is in the area of bauingenieur- and beratungswesens model of the consortium applied the subject of regierungsermittlungen.
A brief overflying the quebecer unternehmensregisters allowed it to name more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be consistent duration.
In this way, for example, the company is working dessau in partnership with the majority of their kernkonkurrenten, to which cima +, génivar, snc-lavalin or Roche and tecsult count together.
Any link, and there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely to dessau.
With regard to the consortium of "énergie gérance," Minister has normandeau stressed that "the territory of the baie James a special arbeitskräftedynamik is subject to and that hydro-québec account of this fact since the 1970s in a special way gives."
Réal laporte, the great employers Société d énergie de la baie James - sebj force, has issued a statement, which has the nose on the fact rümpfen let that the Treaty on the projektleitung after the agreement was approved.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few candidates, your prices to soar."
"You have two options: Either you nimmst people to this mart are and you say to yourself: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, is that not the price is crucial, but underlined the expertise of the people," laporte.
The consortium that "énergie gérance" APPROVED Treaty is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50,000 by the parti québécois received dollars.
The contracts were either of the hydro-québec or the sebj for the project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert approved.
Was to review the newspaper "Le devoir" more than 100 ingenieurs- and beraterverträge, the firms or their branches, including, in particular, ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010 were allowed.
Snc-lavalin had 22 contracts in gerafft, génivar had received 16, tecsult 14 and dessau 10, not counting their involvement in "énergie gérance" here.
All of these contracts are negotiated.
They amount to 449 in the entire $783 344, including the treaty with "énergie gérance" about 295 131 $564.
Sylvain simard had indicated that the four firms, which form the consortium - bpr, dessau, Groupe sm and axor - the "parti libéral you québec are well known."
Minister normandeau had let full capacity, the pq is equally associated with the companies they "financed" before they specify that it was about their leaders.
Barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - the "green" label is not inspire me with confidence
Green, but not sceptical.
The quebecer consumer has little confidence to the key players of sustainable growth, however, nor to the characterised brands or the öko-kennzeichnungen to steer his election.
Pity, although there are in a media universe, where it of information for a verantwortungsbewußteren consumption only as if: the barometer of responsible consumption has led to a lack of credible information, a shortcoming, the brakes on his commitment kenntlich power, as the first reading showed that was held yesterday.
Although they promoted the use of the so called socially responsible products in 2010 appear to have the quebecer Yet those who try to sell them to show little credit.
Two thirds of the quebecer population is, in fact, the umweltengagement of the firms to pay as little faith as the Greens unternehmenswerbung betrays the responsible of the University verbraucherzentrum sherbrooke sophisticated administrative tool.
Out the other findings: half of consumers doubts the trustworthiness of official, to the supposedly fair products angefügten certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands, as umweltbewußt declare, so the barometer.
For equal pattern is the discourse of politicians on this issue of only 14.6% of the quebecer population taken seriously.
The information about responsible consumption appears, however, important to stimulation this konsumsegments which currently of approximately only a third of the quebecer consumers boost.
In fact, dämpften empty and dubious character of the information the zeal of 46% of the consumers.
This is the second after the higher price of the products, from the barometer identified brake.
Also, a third of the quebecer products and services of the performance of the Greens, which it is trying to put you in the hand, with mistrust.
According to a different communication had already on half of the consumers in 2010 changed their habits and changed the brand of one or more products, mainly in order to give the expression of their conviction.
According to barometers, they were purchases in traders to 61% of their stadtviertels preferred and encourages the purchase of food products grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of umweltbewußten consumption this year had a 64 of the maximalwertes achieved by 100 - the homo consumus of Quebec loves it to present itself as a king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by he takes care of the welfare.
But the social and environmental awareness seems to make it stop before his car, so the barometer: just 28% of the quebecer have indicated in 2010 used public transport or the mitfahrzentrale prefers to have in order to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The zufußgehen and were also from the cycling 39,1% of the participants in this comprehensive verhaltensumfrage supports the klischeevorstellungen sources.
Staatsanleihe for the takeover of excentris
The quebecer government, which has been called on by the Société angus and the company parallèle financially in the takeover of the kinokomplexes excentris declared to participate with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The entwicklergesellschaft angus, as well as the company parallèle a donation to the tune of seven million dollars by the kultusministerium for the adoption of Daniel langlois belonging kinokomplexes excentris on the boulevard saint-laurent had hoped to have this back its actual cineastischen role to überantworten, do not seem to get what you have demanded.
Although the government has accepted to involve in this matter, but on their own terms.
Instead of the expected donation offers the quebecer government instead of a bond in less than the amount originally hoped to launch the conditions to benefit a viable solution could, at least according to opinion from the state gerüchteküche entnehmbaren sources.
A first action plan and a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the bittgesuch was again since the summenmäßig revised downward.
A proposal, along with a plan of action have already been the president of the "Société de développement des Entreprises culturelles' - sodec - François macerola, Minister of st-pierre broadcast, which chairs the excentris file.
Several days ago, he had her a last sachbericht send.
The counter-proposal of the Cabinet, the sodec, however, sent on Wednesday.
Parallèle and angus now have time to respond to this by the end of December.
In any case, the premise of the staatsspende really been pushed to the side.
Let us remember that the quebecer eigentümergemeinschaft of cinema and kinokomplexe against a direct staatsinvestition to support the adoption of excentris aufgelehnt had issued by the argument, the culture minister have no financial aid for immobilienprojekte to play there, which he does not other kinosälen have to send.
Several other participants of the segment, but in contrast to a substantial, economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel langlois had after the eigenfinanzierten construction of the cinema for more than ten years under great difficulties, the autorenkino in the premises of his kinokomplexes presented what could justify the's unique position on the part of government money.
The lack of kinosälen, the independent films show is more than evident in Montreal, and excentris knew his clients want to keep on board.
The Société angus and the company parallèle with Christian yaccarini at the top, taxes, for its part, a privately funded campagne, of which they hoped for a sum of $700 000 to stimulate the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009 is only a single screen that continues to show films in excentris, namely Le parallèle.
Aim of the future erwerber it is, the three kinosäle on 27 February next year with the exhibition of the very successful film of Mr beauvois "of the hommes et the dieux" to open a new one.
Christian yaccarini but the newspaper "Le devoir" has not removed, and they ignored what he and his group of the proposals to keep you has made to the bottom respectively.
Secret of the komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted
The new American diplomatenleitungen by WikiLeaks were spread to reveal the mystery over what the United Nations under the Canadians' inferiority complex towards the Americans consider; they, but with the same blow the überlegenheitsgefühl letztgenannter open to Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters in the Round does not have the kanadisch-amerikanischen relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the Conservative government to impose its budget by 2009.
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were spread publicly yesterday to offer more pikante details as the very substantial content in which we have to knabbern.
One of 22 September 2008, together, that is, in the period in which the federal wahlkampage in full swing befindlich was reported about the point from which the United Nations no longer participate in the operations discussed by their political bosses.
To the great surprise of David wilkins, of the American ambassador used in Ottawa.
Mr wilkins offers various erklärungsmöglichkeiten this situation.
"The kanadiern almost innewohnender inferiority complex, led the Canadian, political leaders may be much more likely to talk about internal disputes of daily life, as the United States in this election, blaming the buck - like in 1988 in the campaign on the trade protectionism," he describes.
The United Nations, schlußfolgert he are thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipräsent, but potentially threatening to speak of him."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" even less, as the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assessed, "it should have the ability of one of the candidates, a party and even more of a parteichefs to lead such an essential relationship, which has the polls as a key factor in the sense of the voters."
The other is expression of this sense of importance on 22 January 2009 by Terry in the breese, geschäftsträger in Ottawa, gesendeten communication, the President is to prepare Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Their trip will help the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget to ensure the beginning of February, his first deficit in the Canada will be known after more than a decade, the result of a belebungsprogrammes has arisen in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars," describes breese.
Nowhere he had mentioned that the Government had have to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas, in order to prevent that Parliament would be toppled by the coalition and the continued existence of opposition parties as conditional on the quality of the proposed belebungsprogramms would impact.
A further, by January 2008, and from the Ambassador wilkins communication written agreed by the increasing negative image that the Washington on cbc broadcast, spread dramatic series of the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts as border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and h2o in which there is little subtle statements to Maher arar," or the "no-fly-list abführungen for the purposes of by muskelprotze examinations administered by the CIA can monitor.

Global Plan for the renewal of the lighting
The UN has a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households yesterday in Cancun, Trade and Industry in 100 countries in relation to the achievement of a reduction in the treibhausgases - CFC - proposed that the equivalent of nearly a third of the additional reduction, which must be carried out in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the specific projects, which hopes to implement the UN in Cancun, in order to compensate for the absence of constraints reduktionsverpflichtungen of developed countries.
After the plan expressed yesterday, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes would - gt - of CFCs because of the lighting made on the earth be avoided if the weißglühenden pears, which has yet to constitute a monopoly on the market from 50 to 70%, by fluoreszierende or, better still, by leuchtdioden - led - would be replaced.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
This represents an equivalent of 70% of the smoke of global fleets.
In Copenhagen had the big last year abgasemittenten such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including those from Canada also was to voluntary reduktionsplänen to the global fckw-emissionen of 53 gt to 49 gt herunterschrauben should.
From this record, it would, however, still 5 gt to withdraw today by the year 2020, the klimaanstieg to stabilise 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent this spiral out of control.
In the weißglühenden pears entweicht 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced by 75% of the energy consumption, with the new led-glühbirnen be reduced this energy once again in the double.
The kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep between 6,000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new led-glühbirnen, such as those of the manufacturers Philips has put on the market this week, the society has, in the uno-studie part - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours pears and use less energy than a weißglühende 80%, which is a suggestion of the einsparmöglichkeiten of auswechselungsplanes message that should be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that iese completely novel make very little heat incandescent light bulbs, they can also with a regelwiderstand work.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves are because they contain mercury and that they are so as sondermüll to dispose of what is not always possible, except in the developing countries, the producers are a Bring Centre available.
The main source of quecksilberemissionen on the planet, according to the report, however, does not have the kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal plants that emit much more mercury to the weißglühenden pears wasted to produce electricity.
In the United States alone push this coal plants 25,000 tons of mercury from every year.
The report gives detailed the profits of each country thanks to this international programmes would earn.
Indonesia would, for example, a billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and save eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 kohlekraftwerken, whose erbauung Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expected criticism of the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon Has the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in the Ivory Coast directly after their fristablauf demanded.

The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo by with a constitutional council be taken into account.
The gbagbo-kontrahenten, however, are now more of the view that the country's High Court was not neutral, as it by Paul Yao n 'dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo will be led.
Alassane ouattara, man of the north, of any link with the ex-rebellen denies that the delay in the announcement of the election results has judged as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect it, even if he did not go so far is to demand the victory.
His bündnisparter confirm Gbagbo blockiere the publication of the results, because he knows that he had lost, and submit a complaint before the Constitutional Court, after it was prevented from the electoral commission to publish the results, seie illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday were for the crowning glory of of association and versöhnungsprozesses kept a country that, for years, was divided into two parts.
The United Nations had the politicians of the Ivory Coast on Wednesday warned that it could be held responsible for this in the event of possible riots.

Affaire clotilde reiss: the elysée-palast exaggerates his mittlerfunktion for Syria
In more than six months, from July 2009 by May 2010, was the fate of clotilde reiss, a young French forscherin, which was held for "espionage" in Iran, the French public in breath, left the diplomacy in alarmbereitschaft and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Tehran and Paris.
All of this look under the attentive the diplomats of the United States.
The WikiLeaks received and the newspaper "Le Monde" durchgesehenen American documents be some price behind this crisis.
They describe as the Elysée had declared his strategy of the Americans, which went so far this advice on dealing with their own 'taking of hostages' crisis in Iran - a small group of wanderern - to give in.
They show on, as the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young französin not the release of Majid kakavand, a held prisoner in France and as a result of trade with material by the American justice system in favour of the Iranian nuklearprogrammes sought iraners to gegeleistung have.
They finally set the way with which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media to the purposes, this is the idea to make credible, the Syrian president bachar al-Assad have a central role in the liberation of clotilde reiss played in a harsh light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatentelegramm is entitled "Iran: French comments about the way of dealing with the taking of hostages."
François richier, elysée-berater in strategiefragen, had accompanied by patrice paoli, Director of the Quai d orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomatin kathleen allegrone.
They said the method of the French.
The advised the Americans to do all we can to their own nationals rückzuführen, which would forcibly held in Iran.
"power of noise," they said, 'articulated loudly and clearly and without unterlass "the words" grundmenschenrechte, "" innocence, "" immediate release "in the media.
This is necessary in order to bring the Iranian regime in embarrassment, respects the very sensitive to his image.
"This is all the more so because you ask the Iranians not to do that."
Because "silence solves nothing," over the diskussionsversuche on on unauffälligem ways, the Iranians are "champion in ausweichmanövern."
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners' geläufige that Iranian tactics "was:" taking hostages for the purposes of political blackmail."
He is on the release of clotilde reiss from the prison - which should be reached on August 16, in the days, in the refuge in the French Embassy - "Want the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians' - 230,000 euro bail -.
And he is known, the Elysée antizipiere other hostages taken, a phenomenon that "will become even more acute."
The Iranians could "in the near future a different of the roughly 1,800 arrest French nationals living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde reiss is 12 days ago has been released from the prison, but is still held in Iran.
Information was put into circulation: the Iranians Majid kakavand, whose extradition to the United States because of illegal trade in empfindlichem elektronikmaterial call to Iran is to entscheid a judge in Paris has been released from detention.
The American message is, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing koinzidenz.
For Washington, which the illegal Iranian networks of the purchases of the material planned for the nuclear programme is followed the release of Majid khakavand bad news.
France has taken a horse trading in purchase?
The liberation of the iraners against one of the französin?
At a new meeting with kathleen allegrone assured on 4 September François richier that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised" by the decision of the judge, but have also tried to prevent it aufzulehnen.
"It has been a rain of exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" - currently michèle alliot-marie - but the French Government "cannot change the judicial decision," he said.
Mr richier would also like to point out that Majid kakavand remain under supervision of the French intelligence service is "strict."
The elysée-berater chooses a telephone number, sets back on, then informed the American diplomatin, the Iranians "would currently in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris."
During the gewahrsams of clotilde reiss in Iran care not to use his efforts of the Elysée statements given and organised by the media to make "fluchtversuche" Believe that the Syrian president bachar al-Assad games an "important" and "influential mittlerrolle."
The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony and say that the manipulation bears fruit, as several articles reflect the official French version.
One of 25 August 2009 datierendes telegramm calls "the medienblitz the French authorities" inevitable.
What is so much "dankesbezeugung" with Mr Assad asks the message in Paris.
"Despite their statements full of lobpreis be secretly to the French authorities that they have only a vague idea of what the syrier have actually done."
The document is also concerned with the reasons that have led the Elysée fall of this fiction.
The intensive kommunikationsbemühungen "aims to Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria to confirm," he analysed.
A policy launched in 2008," at the time by many kritikerstimmen in France and abroad as premature and unverdient was felt."
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" attempts to engage in Paris' Syria in mind, what belobigung we can achieve it by playing a constructive role in the region. "
The aim is also "to sow discord between Syria and Iran."
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François had richier entrusted to it: "Of course, we do not know whether the syrier which also have always done."
"But we have, in spite of everything, thanks to you."
"This should at least cause confusion in the Iranians."
Clotilde reiss go back on 16 May 2010 to France.
Nicolas Sarkozy in the Elysée receives it.
In a press release he thanks the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria for its "active role in favor of the release of our compatriot."
No internet gambling for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean Government will adopt a law, called "The aschenbrödel," which it will ban the young people, after midnight online-games to play them by blocking the access, later regierungsverantwortliche.
A bill, the online-spiele-betreiber is to encourage young people under 16 years after midnight to deny access to these games, will be submitted to the Parliament in December, schilderten representatives of education and familienministerien.
"Many children play this Games spent the whole night and then have difficulties with Learning in the school and, thus, to lead a normal life during the day."
"We are of the opinion that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo rin, with this bill betrauter ministerialbeauftragter, the French press agency agence France Press.
The online-games are then available again from 6 a.m..
The herstellergesellschaften would have time to prepare for the application of the law for a year, so he to specify.
The Government fasser as well in the eye, to ask the manufacturers, the daily granted access to these Games for the time limit to those young people whose parents ask, added the responsible.
As those people who want it to happen, it will gratisprogramme available, which will make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "network" countries, and the newspapers regularly reports from various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in world online-game-wettbewerben.
In November, South Korea to 58 other nations had four goldmedaillen cyber war in the world games won.
World Cup 2018-2022: the FIFA will appoint the ausrichterland
In bright excitement because of korruptionsverdacht will appoint the exekutivkomitee the FIFA on Thursday ausrichterländer of World Cup 2018 and 2022, a highly political election, in which the rangeln for influence, and it was lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria in the background.
But one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the FIFA königsdisziplin will take place in Europe, their traditional hochburg, - the 4 candidates: England, Russia, spanien-portugal, niederlande-belgien -.
The edition 2022 will then be exotic something; the International Football Federation hopes new territories after the first on the African continent in the year 2010 - Qatar, Australia - can win for themselves, or its branch in the United States or in the Far East - Japan, South Korea - to pursue further.
The list of people who belong to the delegation - David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Zidane, beckham, cruyff - is the degree of economic and political use of a World Cup.
The actions behind the scenes are therefore encourage until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to draw up a hierarchy of candidates.
In the aftermath of the FIFA evaluationsbericht, provide the English, spanisch-portugiesische - 2018 - and us - 2022 - acts bessseren arguments than its competitors.
But these considerations for the 22 members of the exekutifkommitees not be so strong on the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, which provoke the suspension of two members of the exekutifkommitees - reynald temarii and Amos Adamu - was the beginning of the revelations, if the opportunities for their own country as well, can ruin the cradle of football, was allowed to fight the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC had given the breeding ground renewed on Monday by a dokumentarbericht had broadcast of the three senior members of the kommitees, Ricardo teixeira, Nicolas leoz and issa hayatou is under attack.
Reason enough to anger the FIFA and the English leaders to bring in embarrassment, in the first place, with David Cameron in these last few weeks, an intensive was lobbying had operated.
The Head of Government hopes for a resumption of the of his predecessor Tony Blair successful schachzuges, which in 2005 had reached the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games to London.
This intensive use would be sufficient to the image of England before the kommitee enhance again?
Nothing is less safe because the duo spanien-portugal there is no shortage of trümpfen, with its already ready stages, his expertise - 82 World Cup in Spain, 92 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal - and his fußballkultur.
But the economic and financial downside of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal make the opportunities of Russia which, despite its gaps in the dossier - stadiums, hotels, transport - The important outsider has become rise.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided that the unumwundenen suggestion to the bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the kommiteemitglieder denounced.
"You bewirft them with dirt, you try to compromise," lashed out Putin.
For 2022 seem strengthened by the experience of the United States in 1994, the logical favoriten.
First economic world power, seat of the country fifa-hauptsponsoren seems a long list of yielded benefits to Japan and South Korea, which have set a very good project separately.
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries, the competitions in 2002 mitorganisiert had.
A different threat: the hotly desired by the FIFA approval for the World Cup 2026 for China to let the lapse of the Asian opportunities to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, with the aufwartung futuristischer stages had drawn all register, the FIFA has its expansion in the direction of new areas, but these two countries constitute a greater risk because certainty.
Australia could as well as Japan and South Korea under the weakness of the European countries akquittierten of television rights - because of the zeitverschiebung - have to suffer the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
Second mandate: the offenkundigkeit
De Gaulle had really gestutzt.
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze.
Mr Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next existence.
The current head of state will be so candidate in 2012.
But the offenkundigkeit is the side of the mysteriums the präsidentschaftsfunktion connotation, and not good to face.
So we must do so, as if the doubts would be to take.
In one, as well as in the other way.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe that.
On 15 November Nicolas Sarkozy assured in ernstem tone "his decision to take" At some point in the autumn of the year 2011.
On that he dienstagabend in the Elysée before the ump-parlamentariern would let the prospect of "two mandates" full capacity, therefore had a little fieberhaftigkeit spread.
This was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President was just to remind that the amendments to the Constitution by 2008, the number of five years of all terms to just two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned at such meeting in a humorous tone of the presidential election.
"You have, at worst, seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010: "does not believe that I do not reflecting on the stage after that."
His words of the day before yesterday does not make him more on the candidate than the previous day, but no less.
They should cause comments, then from a double reason.
The acceleration of wettlaufes about the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the inclusion of competition with Ségolène Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy this is to reveal.
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidacy in 2012, the many Members of the PS early call to challenge than anticipated.
The poor surveys on the other side.
Together for the first time would the voters of the right a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy - 46% against 44%, according to the poll, bva-l 'express - prefer.
"We have a candidate, and there are with the ump no discussions about this," responded immediately and careful the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he would find a defeat as possible, he would not candidate," Mr Raffarin with shares.
"He will always believe to be able to win," corrected Alain juppé with the offenkundigkeit has resigned.
Euro, the ECB is forced to their ankäufe of staatspapieren maintain
The final assembly of the zentralbankrats the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to identify opportunities such as it emerges from the crisis, or at least the order of a large number of using unconventional measures of monetary policy to declare the end of the year to reach its conclusion.
The crisis of public debt to the European Central Bank in Frankfurt cannot afford it certainly, the current tense situation on the European bond markets, more than verwirken in order not to provoke their deterioration.
The political costs that would be far too high.
The French finanzministerin Christine lagarde had yesterday during a press conference held by the ECB, active role for the solution of the staatshaushaltsverschuldung welcomed in Europe.
It has not dared to say whether it is of the opinion that the central bank could do more, for example, by boosting their programme of the ankäufe of government bonds.
"I do my reasons for my European trading partner before - containing inflation."
Mr Trichet, President of the ECB had the previous day in Brussels, at his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is not very redegewandt shown on his plans, but rather content to point out that the programme of the purchases of staatspapieren on the secondary market would be "weiterbetrieben" and that we will see in the Assembly on Thursday "as the decisions to be."
Only certainty that the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historical lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the obligationskäufe the schatzkammer by the ECB last week to about 1,35 doubled billion euros.
And according to leaks of some traders to yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese staatspapieren have made.
Overall, the central banks of the euro system made purchases in excess of 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the traders will be for the anticipation of a weiterverfolgens of kaufkurses not doubt - see page 29 -.
The volkswirte already expect no longer remarkable change of course.
If the anleihengeschäfte of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still in the full geldmittelreserven on freigiebige make way to create, and over a period of a week of up to three months.
The volkswirte are already taken today to it that this measure will extend for a few months yet.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a significant way."
"Otherwise they would take the risk to provoke new tensions in the short term," suspected Michael schubert, volkswirt the commerzbank.
"A for the course of the first quarter in 2011, progressive exit seems to me to be more likely," anticipates, Norbert bräms, volkswirt in sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their intervention in the market of the public debt," the ECB should such a kaufvolumen to securities aufrechthalten "given that the sluggish market, Norbert adds bräms added.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks on the markets of the public debt in the euro area, the Central Bank has no other choice but to keep their presence on the market.
"They must at any price to the steller enter the lack of investors on the market and such action to the rash of enthusiasm about the returns paid to the most vulnerable states to prevent," bezeugte yesterday an important obligationeninhaber.
Because if the interest rates begin to boom, the States would prevented even more to reduce its debt, or only to stabilize.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Berlusconi government is in Italy in cover
After a worrying for Italy wochenanfang yesterday, the situation with the decline in the eckzinsen a little down to 10 years.
A return to a deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the economy minister had the regionsvorsitzenden Giulio Tremonti qualify as "unentzifferbar" to the situation and have it with a weekend of "unvorhersagbaren" expect to hear what the person concerned, however, immediately,.
On Tuesday, the gap with the German interest rates would have achieved its record of 210 basispunkten, and the prices of the Treaties to meet the konkursrisikos had risen to 263 points, what a certain kopflosigkeit had caused in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had in his Council of Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates in 400 basispunkten lies.
His right hand, gianni letta, but had as "seriously concerned" by the "market turbulence" and said a possible danger from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro zone, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is such as Portugal," said Irwin stelzer, volkswirt at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language may be the problem is the absenz of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtigen steuereingänge, put in danger, the state will no longer be able to cover its financing needs.
The last of Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and expected of 1.4% in the year 2012... although the has been submitted to the Senate for consideration haushaltsbudget counts with 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, it is calculated the EU Commission, will represent the budget deficit in the next year or 4.3% of GDP - contrary to the governments of the projected 3.9% - and - instead of 2.7% - 3.5% in the year 2012.
Therefore the turmoil for a new haushaltskollektiv that after the feiertagen could be used to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new tightening measures need to be taken," says Auditors Olli Rehn.
On the hour, Italy is the support of international institutions.
"The very foundations of Italy's economy is in order and its accounts are settled, we have repeated that for a long time," assured arrigo sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy.
"At the moment, there are no problems in the short term, nor in the long term, because of Italy Despite its high debt - 119,2% of GDP in 2011, A. D. R. - lower stabilisationsfortschritte as demanded by other countries," observed Pier Carlo padoan, chef-volkswirt the OECD.

According to météo France, covered the intensive schneeschauer the Gironde north and the charentes, it schneit easy on the ET ile-de-france.
In the departments concerned will be schneedecken from 2 to 5 cm, expected by 7 to 10 cm in places and 1 cm to 3, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
Affected are the regions charente, charente-maritime, côtes d armor, finistère, Gironde, dordogne, poitou and the regions basse-normandie, ile-de-france and limousin.
The snowfall early are substantial enough to verkehrsbehinderungen approaching and to affect certain economic activities, says météo France advance.
In the region côtes d armor are several regionalstrassen for the schwerverkehr closed of over 7.5 tonnes, including the transport axes guingamp-lannion and saint-brieuc-loudéac.

The dgab recommends the flugpassagieren to contact their airline.
The Gatwick airports in the south London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro grand Paris: first financial skizzen
Since the debate about the modernization of the transport industry on the ile-de-france is in full swing, it rains billion.
At least in the discussions.
You call this the 23 billion for the grand Paris underground in memory, in particular the Société du grand Paris is to be built.
To the baubeginn the sgp in the ways to implement the state has declared a kapitaldotation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical consideration, this is the sum of the sgp would then allow on the markets is a part of the finanzsumme to give their double.
Today, it is, after all, first hochrechnungen come.
The ergänzungshaushalt by 2010, studied this morning by the finanzkommission of the National Assembly, contains the proposed measures to raise the first part of that money.
It is two measures: the creation of a special tariff on erschließund and a higher tax of the offices on the ile-de France.
The former, remove the article 15 of the gesetzesentwurfes, is "in favor of Société du grand Paris' public service center.
Quantified these is: "is the product of this tax to 117 million euros per year."
Zweitere is a renewal of existing tax: "In order to modernize this, in order to increase the product resulting from it and the increase of the Société du Grand Paris to überantworten."
How much would bring this?
A mystery.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
Of the 4 billion it is far away.
"It is said that the fiscal resources of the 4 billion euros in the kapitaldotation be added to be paid by the state and the Grand Société du Paris to be done for the project and after," is to come from the explanatory outline.
In the sgp this system will be not offensive.
"Since the moment in which they scored the Revenue - The two taxes, D. R. -, you can projektierung on for three years, and only then draw from the 4 billion," will be declared.
"This is listed in the budget and after and after deducted."
The sgp estimated that will be started in 2013 to note the 4 billion for the budget in 2014.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions we will be able to seek still long, is in danger of had a right to provoke parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on December 7.
Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies
The affaire WikiLeaks has a dual importance.
On one side, it is emerging as an obvious scandal, a scandal, just a scandal in the sinner hypocrisy is that the beziehunge ruled between the states, the people and the press.
On the other hand, it is of profound changes on the international level, and is a taste of the future dominated by recession.
But we are in the series.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file prepared by a Secret Service - a old nation - exclusively from zeitungsausschnitten made.
The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw from nothing more than what it for months, did anyway to read in every old journal - except those whose owners is Berlusconi - and the shocking karikaturierte profile gaddafis offered kabarettkünstlern already substance since a long time for their sketche.
The rule that the secret files should be known only from already news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go in a library, the esotherischen publications on, they will see that each work - about the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-chateau, the templer or the rosenkreuzler - exactly a repetition of what has already been written in previous works.
This is not alone, therefore, that the author okkulter texts do not want to publish research - yet, therefore, that he does not know where news on the nicht-existierende would be to find -, but because those who, the okkultismus to believe in nothing other than that of what you already know and confirmed what they have learned.
This is also the erfolgsmechanismus by Dan Brown.
As the geheimakten.
The informer is lazy, and lazy - or limited spirit - is also the head of the Secret Service - otherwise he could be as always, for example, Editor in libération - the only considered as true, what he recognizes.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi had sent by the American Embassy in Rome of the staatsdezernat were the same as those of the newsweek already had published the week before.
So why was such a fuss made the revelations of this dossier?
On one side is this what every educated person already knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the government can call each other or can take a plane to take the Dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small repräsentationsaufgaben, have turned in spionagezentren.
Any old viewers of ermittlungsfilmen know this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that we do so to ignore that.
Nevertheless, the fact that it violates publicly to repeat the task of hypocrisy and serves to the American diplomacy to put in a bad light.
In second place: the idea that a x-beliebiger hackers the geheimsten secrets can tap the most powerful country in the world, carries the significant blow against the prestige of the staatsdezernats.
The scandal also brings, rather than the victims, the "scharfrichter" in trouble.
But we are giving the profound nature of what has happened.
Former to Orwell's times, one could combine all power as a Big Brother, which controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prediction would have since then can turn out to be absolutely right where you can control any movement through the telephone, each transaction, which made hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens visited the total would be victims of the power auges.
But if we in mind is what is happening today that even the secret krypten of power is no longer the control of a hackers can escape, so, the kontrollgang to be directed to unilaterally, and will zirkelförmig.
The power of control of all citizens, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - erwählt as vindicator of the citizen - can get the SECRETS OF THE power in experience.
But how can keep a power, which is no longer able to maintain their own secrets?
It is true that George simmel have already said that a real secret is an empty secret - and an empty secret can never be exposed -; it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's, in fact, a secret free of geheimis is as it reveal the public sphere, but in the styles of WikiLeaks disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, is to deprive them of power.
WikiLeaks neither Sarkozy nor Merkel has done wrong, against but Obama and Clinton.
What will be the consequences of this violation, which was inflicted on such a huge power?
It is obvious that the States will ask no information reserved in the future more Online - that would be one on the street corner angeklebten aushang to.
But it is also clear that it is with the current technologies in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports on secret telephone.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State has contacted moved in a plane and one of his colleagues.
How could in future, private and only for certain ears certain relations?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment to science fiction and romanhaft sounds, but I am compelled me the regierungsagenten present, in a secret way diligent on uncontrollable marschrouten moving, nowhere else than the mere memory with their communications written order, and also the few of the information they have to get in the schuhabsatz verbergend.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed existence: in fact, the spionageversuch as WikiLeaks made less success of Watergate.
I had the opportunity to write that, today, the technology is like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraf had revolutionised the communication, reconstructed the Internet a telegrafen with - Telephone - draht.
The - analogue - videokassetten had the filmforschern allows a film bond for band auszukundschaften forward by one of the spulen and all the secrets of the montage could drop, while the - numerical - CDs today allow nothing more than to jump chapter by chapter, that is, in makroportionen.
With the fast trains will be within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this by plane, including the umsteigens requires three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary return to car and horse that policy and communication technologies.
A final observation.
In previous times tried to understand what the press for secrets between the messages were forged.
Currently, it is the messages demanding the confidential information to the press.
Climate: as France, its finanzversprechen schönredet
A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time the observance of the dissolved quickly finanzierungsversprechen - also "Almost start called" or premature Finance - to investigate, which were implemented by the developing countries.
And already are the gross French schönredereien exposed.
With the Treaty of Copenhagen, the developing countries have committed to allocate 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France - i.e. 420 million a year - 1.26 billion euros.
At the opening of the cop16, the EU has drawn all register their level of commitment to its partners of the fact with regard to the fast-start-finanzierungen to convince: detailgetreuer vorgehensbericht of its Member States, the press conference, great nebenevents, broschürenverteilung.
The operation of transparency is remarkable and extent of its real value estimated: the developing countries and the civil society would like it if all developed countries of the same on the same präzisionsniveau made.
The EU announced, in 2010 2.2 billion euros to have released what they on the right way to respektbezollung brings its commitment of 7.2 billion in the year 2012.
If one looks into detail but things are a little more complicated.
This money should be "new and additional" according to the Treaty of Copenhagen, to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, without to be to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonisation certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today everyone chooses the benchmark he considered as the best.
The EU Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of the year 2009 for: the international funding will be maintained, and is within the framework of the funding "fast-start" 150 million over three years to do so.
Other countries have similar benchmarks, either on year or about conditions at the level of the elected public development aid.
In return to France was of the opinion that the funding "of all new projects" are "new and additional" of the year 2010.
In other words, there is no benchmarks in the spending of the previous year, or at the global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the total of the French support for the developing countries can remain stable - or decline - is - France, its commitment with regard to the "new and additional" comply with funding.
Another key element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
About there is no rule, and everyone elects its rechenmodus.
Some, such as France, are 1 lend _ _ donated as the equivalent of 1.
This is apparently difficult unacceptable: is not comparable to the effort.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment - often to the emissionseindämmung linked projects, based on technologies effektivster - can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro, which we captured as equivalent to a donated euro... there should only be the cost of loan for the kapitalgeberland to be counted as a commitment - that is to say the equivalent of an interest rate -.
But France has nothing different in the sense as the following thought of it, '"respects its commitment of 420 million euros by 91,5% loans - 389,8 million euro - includes accorded and 8.5% - 36,1 million euro - - see the EU documents in order to convince themselves.
France is the only country of the EU that loans up to a large extent.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or the Slovakia - among other things - their commitments to investigate 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 _ spends to fulfil their commitments, France is just 10 cents and understands including a similar use.
Fine hokuspokus!
All in all, operates France in its fast-start-finanzierung with a double fraud: a part with a weiterentwicklkung the action on the time, and the other part with the reality of the financial contributions.
France will be able to let it believe that 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promises and saves in 36,1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Treasury - as it seems to be that it bercy was to have carried out the arbitrage - could lead to a double negative effect; even eu-intern - Why are continuing with the other Member States of the donations made, but if there is enough to lend? - and then in the negotiations because the developing countries is not completely to deceive...
The chapter of premature finance only a small question in a relatively short period in comparison to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could be too much of the drop in the huge machine of the unfccc.
We hope that this will not be the case.
As it always was, it is vital to its lesson from this first year verfrühter funding to learn.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in his verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of respect for its commitments and the compensation justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring the discussions on the funding of the term streitgegenstand forward - another crucial and currently discussed subject -: you escapes the question of "verrechenbarkeit" or the verbuchungsart not of its loans.
France could change its position, to be as advanced in terms of the disputes, as it is for other things.
So the hope is based on the new Environment Minister kosciusko-morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement on the fast-start of France and his vision of "verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would raise the international vertrauensbasis from nature, which is necessary for further discussions.
Sounding the alarm - of children received pesticides
A child of 10 years, on the day of 81 different chemical substances, so this Wednesday of the Association générations futures - former movement for the protection of human rights and the respect of future generations - published study.
The association, which said that their results "given the small number of analyzed samples do not reflect a statistically significant value, but illustrationscharakter represent the issue dealt with," the usually within four had between July and September, food consumed by a child to the meals for about 10 years, plus a zwischenmahlzeit bought in the supermarkets in oise and Paris.
This is typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh frucht- and obstteilen three of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day, were as well as naschereien laboratories on the search for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants are investigated.
The tellerbilanz is stunning: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possible or likely carcinogenic that and five as safe karziogen klassifizierte, as well as 37 substances with endokrinin-störfaktor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International krebsforschungszentrum.
"Even if in the annähernden all the cases of the legal limits for any chemical, individually had substance not be exceeded, remove one of this collection but very well that the reality in which the consumer may be carcinogenic substances or substances with endokrinin-störfaktor is suspended, is worrying," said the association.
Already included in the breakfast alone the butter and tea with milk already more than ten of potentially carcinogenic residues and three sure as carcinogenic proven, as well as more than 20 residues, the hormonsystem can affect.
The apple imported from Brazil, as zwischenmahlzeit planned for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a banned in France fungizid.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including the lunch, on which the study traces of a strictly banned in the EU insektizids has said.
Also were the hacksteak, the tuna from the Pandora, even the baguette and the kaugummi full of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the leitungswasser the analyses of the presence of nitrates and chloroform brought to light.
The dinner was the lachssteak identified with 34, chemical residues on "richest," and even the to insist the meal in the mikrowelle used plastikteller was not free.
The schlußendliche risk this "schadstoffcocktails" for the consumers' will probably be undervalued, "the study.
The "Alliance Europe ecologie-les verts' - ee-lv -, for its part, has" given the urgency of the situation, "proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop the" increase in diseases of civilisation."
In July, a study for the European Food Safety Authority - EFSA - about the presence of residues 365 identified various, identified in fruit and vegetables pesticides, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in getreiden.
