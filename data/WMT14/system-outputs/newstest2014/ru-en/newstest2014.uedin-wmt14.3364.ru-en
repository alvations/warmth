Anger over the verdict organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed as a result of the bombing in Bali in 2002, reacted angrily to the verdict of the last of the conspirators who appeared before the court, and claimed that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the creation of the explosive devices used during the attack.
He may be released within 15 years, if you get parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of the attack on the two night club in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.
He was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism-related charges, including in a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that the man nicknamed "prined" for his reputation as a master for making explosives, should be sentenced to death.
This decision deepened the painful memories of the mother of Perth Curtin Joon, who lost his 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in terror, effected Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
Barely restraining his tears, she said that Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.
"I really believe that he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the stre team, "said Ms. Courtin AAP.
"I must live every day knowing that I will no longer be grandchildren and I don't see my daughters."
"The Sari Club" was destroyed when it was described in the massive bomb in a van parked outside, just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the bar "Paddy" where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack with explosives, just 20 seconds earlier.
After that attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times, being connected to a life support system.
Mr Hughes said that Patek must share the fate of the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty more than all.
Save his life, well, there is no reason to save his life.
Get 20 years after he killed 202 people and wounded hundreds - it is not so much.
Patek is the last of the participants in the terrorist attack in Bali tried.
He was a fugitive for nearly ten years, but in the end, was arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed the former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence data showed: Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore the link between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and al-Qaeda.
"He did not surrender," said Ms. Courtin.
Until recently, he does not regret about how much grief he caused to other people.
The sentence imposed on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be seen later this year in Bali and Australia.
"This year will be a lot of tears," says Ms. Courtin.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.

Once the birds have departed to warm regions, grandmother Anne phoned in Taricani РЕЗ, which belongs to support.
And even did not expect that there will respond so quickly.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovo, they were surprised that the nest in general still holds, "said technical director of DTEK in Dneprooblenergo" Sergei Berezovsky.
On the wires that were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighs 150 to 200 kilograms, started the corrosion.
At any moment, the birds could perish from electrical discharge.

According to experts, it is enough to put the old branches as the basis to hear the birds nest and returned to him.
Even then the storks have completed his house.
A month ago, in the village of pink Novomoskovsk district was reconstructed the first nest.
Next to the electrooporoy set a new reinforced concrete column and placed it on a platform with the old, already livable jack.
The whole operation cost power suppliers in nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrikov district on the grandmother Ani.
Here cemented the platform at the same place, only hoisted above the wires.
Ornithologists sure that cautious, conservative birds don't even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has undergone a major overhaul.
Until the end of the year, the same reconstruction expects another four nests at Pokrovskoe and Dnipropetrovsk Taricani areas.
By the way, while some are saving rare birds, some of them mercilessly killed.
The other day the whole area was excited the sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka Apostolov district, on the opening day of the hunting pheasants, poachers for fun shot swan family, bite at a local pond.
Noble birds is not afraid of people - locals fed them and not offended.
When the villagers heard shots, come to the pond, four of the beauties-swans were lying dead in the water.

Vitaly Mutko: Sodomy?
I think we are for 15 years ago have returned.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the riots in the stands during the match of the Cup of Russia "Shine" - "Spartacus."
I support the idea behind all this meet the organizers of sporting events: The clubs, the league, the RFU.
But we see that they have taken the drug position.
They expect that someone will come from and clean up.

We have now developed a special resolution of the government about the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will tackle this problem.
But I still need to get all the organizers of a football process.

The attorney with cocaine addiction, who warned the gang leader about the police investigation, jailed
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditta transferred information fugitive criminal authority Nil Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction will be disclosed
He was sentenced to three years in prison Liverpool royal court.
The prestigious lawyer who told baron on a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug dependence, was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta transferred a fugitive criminal authority Nil Scarborough classified information about the investigation of his activities for drug trafficking after he was under threat because of his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer who receives the nickname Bas and nicknamed among criminals "steep" lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to conduct surveillance of Scarborough, which he represented in court previously associated with drugs.
Officers noticed how the 32-year-old Scarborough left three sachets of cocaine at the lawyer's house in the town of Blackburn Rovers Lancashire County, while he was at the dinner of the association of lawyers with colleagues.
The investigation exposes that Dita "regularly used" drug class A, after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were at the time under the supervision of the police as part of a massive investigation into the activities of the criminal organization of sales of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and another 32 people were later jailed after being seized by police during a series of raids heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million as well as more than £200,000 in cash.
The 42-year-old Ditta convey information criminals out of fear that his cocaine dependence will be disclosed.
Today, in the royal court Liverpool Ditta, who works at the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was covered in disgrace after admitting his guilt in two cases of intentional obstruction of justice on the results of the three ships in Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed in possession of cocaine on one of the previous court sessions.
The revelation of the lawyer happened after police investigating the activity of Scarborough, found that he regularly talked with Ditta on the phone since February 2011.
Two detective traced the suspects and discovered how he went to the house of the Diet Blackburn and put drugs 60 percent purity in black golf glove under the garbage boxes lawyer.
Soon after the transfer of Scarborough convened repeatedly with Ditta, who was at the dinner at a football stadium Ewood Park team "Blackburn Rovers."
The attorney returned home for drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court heard that Dita "regularly used" cocaine, after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, said he spoke with the suspected dealer, because that was his client, and insisted that their communication is "secret law."
During his detention, Dita took his wallet and attempted to remove several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, he also was taken a sample of hair.
In a police interrogation, he said that along with the workplace, he was the home office, and customers came to his home on legal matters.
However, the court heard that after the important arrests, he called the largest drug trafficking, a number of whom he previously represented in court to tell that detectives know about them.
In an accusatory speech Anne White said: "If someone and knows that it should not violate the law, then it is a lawyer in criminal cases."
Mr. Ditta accused of abusing his position of counsel in criminal cases, since he came in too close relations with certain customers.
Contact, we are talking about is not just a drug dealer and drug dealer, supplying drugs of his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations, of course, would be legitimate because it was their lawyer.
However, it is largely passed the boundaries of normal relations between lawyer and client.
He obstructed the police investigation as hard as it is possible to allow the parties to continue their criminal activity.
Mr. Ditta not honoured their profession, and its posers.
He is too close to certain customers, in particular, Scarborough, and allowed the question of his impartiality.
Ditta did not admit guilt and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and would like to convey information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the meeting of the senior officer Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta turned from a lawyer in criminal cases in the criminal offender as soon as he started to buy drugs from representatives of organized crime."
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main participants in the criminal gangs who trusted him to extract valuable information about the police investigation.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire the public trust and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and attempted to defend myself his profession.
The investigation in the case of Mr. Datta led a division of Lancashire on a particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already made a judgment on three occasions cocaine storage, and now the vosprepyatstvovanion implementation of justice, demonstrating our commitment to achieve a just punishment for the perpetrators.
Let the case will serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and attract to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after admitting his guilt in a conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people who participated in the machinations, were sentenced to a total of 153 years for crimes related to drugs.
On its website Ditta arranged a conversation in the form of questions and answers, in which he says that the job of his dreams is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the perfect companion for him over dinner - Mohammed Ali, and the motivation to work is inequality.
Manufacturers of the jet aircraft feud over the seat width, when large orders at stake
Among the leading manufacturers of aircraft provoke a bitter dispute about the width of tourist-class seats on long flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai air show this month.
The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights economy-class passengers whose interests are not always in the focus of airlines, with the volume of a dedicated space for them plays a key role in statements about the effectiveness of the last planes offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of the industry standard that would have included the seat width of not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class passengers, but its main American rival, Boeing says that it must solve the airline.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales of increasingly large versions of their motor long-haul planes, and on November 17-21 event expected potentially record orders.
Integration of the rear part of the plane - especially the whether sitting 9 or 10 people in a row - occupies a central place in statements about the economic efficiency of new projects "mini-tooling."
Boeing argues that its new 777X will contain 406 people on the basis of the seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width, placed on 10 in each row.
Airbus says that a competing version of its A900 will be transported in economy-class 350 people in the 18-inch wide seats, located in nine in a row.
Giants aircraft often exchanged blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is appealing directly to the public before the study in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what could be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing financiers slide, representing three people in a restaurant, pressed to each other, "you would agree on it?"
"Boeing is offering long-haul flights on seats more narrow than the regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
With the change of diet, people are gaining weight, but the aircraft seats have changed dramatically.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the glider Boeing 747 set the standards of modern long-distance travel, and abroad century, the average weight of American men aged 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
Bhat waist average American men of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistics of the U.S. Public Health Service.
Airbus argues that its rival, adheres to the concept of the seats of the 1950s, when the average waist girth of those who recently called "reactive audience" was already.
Airbus says that ordered the study, testifying that an additional inch in width seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputed Airbus figures on the size of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions on how airlines to find a balance between tariffs and amenities.
She said studies show that convenience shop depends not only on the width of the seats.
"It really comes down to providing airlines choices and opportunities to do what they think they need to do to achieve success," said Boeing specialist at Kent Craver saloon.
They don't want us to decide for them that will bring them a profit.
They know their job better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it increasingly becomes a factor that may affect the profits.
Behind this dispute is a race for orders for planes, estimated at least $700 billion computers on prices in the coming decades - enough to change the balance of the American and European exports.
As first reported in July, the Reuters news agency, the location of the seats is exactly what fuels rivalry in the battle between the latest rocket planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing have reported a 20-percent increase in profitability in one place in their last motor long-haul models, compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing claimed characteristics of partly based on a comparison of 10-local 777X ranks with the original 9-local layout rows of constructive solutions to the 777.
Winning the specific cost is reduced when compared with the 10-local layout used nowadays.
"The reason why the Boeing makes it, is to squeeze more seats and make your plane more competitive compared with our development," said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say the salons with a full 10-local rows for existing 777-point out that many passengers prefer dense seating arrangements that can go hand-in-hand with lower tariffs.
"Eighteen inches wide seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal due to the threat from 777-th model," said the interior upholstery specialist Mary Kirby, the founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing does not provide chairs, but offers a directory of suppliers, from which the airline can choose.
The travelling around the world jet sellers even carry a wheel to verify the competing layout.
Rashvalivaya comfort, all manufacturers also offer planes with a very dense interior layout for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus is offering a 10-A900 local rows, but says that she still did not sell it.
Until recently, Airbus highlighted the need for additional modifications of salons, offering broader space to pass on some of their planes.
Without the support of the only other maker of large modern aircraft, as experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to "soar" but could divert attention from the wave of sales of the 777X model.

Concerns about security in Mozambique grows as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the using down the statue Samora Machel, president and founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo, chanting slogans about the world on one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want to return the world; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sus, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of their country, she replaced a business suit on a T-shirt decorated with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined on Thursday to a crowd in the capital's Independence Square.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo is one of the most violent clashes since the cease-fire for more than 20 years ago.
Renamo once was known rebel movement, which was driven by the first white authorities Rhodesia, and then the government of the apartheid-era South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the government of an independent country.
After the 1992 truce, it has become an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again falls to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have forced nervous foreign investors and local residents.
The stakes are high for a growing economy, since the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west may attract more than $50 billion in investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling party Frelimo, a leading political force since 1975, and the party Renamo accused each other of responsability tension.
The party Renamo argues that the government has become the last big clashes, attacking its members in the province of diseases brought, a traditional point of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked the base Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, a leader of the group, told the Financial Times newspaper Fernando Mazanga, Renamo spokesman.
The government blames Renamo in initiating clashes, accusing the party in the attack on the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to dispel fears about instability.
Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt "loser" sathee use "all that is left of his forces to try to prove that he can impose the government's own decisions."
As Frelimo and Renamo insist that want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after reports that Renamo Mazanga said of the refusal of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that meant failure to comply with the agreement Frelimo party.
"Our goal is to return to the talks, but seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease tension, which led to a series of clashes this year.
"It's two influential person (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who heads," said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer of the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is not a good negotiator and none of them are not ready to go on the necessary concessions.
Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve the electoral reform, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections, scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted it as an effort to pressure oslabevshego movement to achieve concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of the vote for Renamo declines since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by former member of the Renamo is expected to improve its performance in this election.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, who must go down in the next year, when the end of his second term, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want to multi-party democracy, he does not want to transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he did not want to leave the presidency," said Mazanga.
News up to the possibilities Renamo, but she already has devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key highway leading from the north to the south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of diseases brought, which is located a few hundred miles to the north of Maputo, but includes Beirut's port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railroad tracks about a week after Renamo threatened to attack on the railroad.
Mazanga declince was when he was asked a question about whether Renamo repeat this threat.
The party Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not very good," said Mazanga.
Instability strengthened the discontent with the government, but many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and increased kidnappings recently, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media companies Mediacoop.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country have a government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultan, a member of the demonstration, said that people simply want stability.
"No one cares neither Renamo nor Frelimo, they simply want to the resumption of peace, they want free access to roads," he said.
The rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia so far will remain in force
Australian airline passengers will need to continue to switch off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite the US measures to mitigate the rules regarding the data devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration, the US has allowed U.S. carriers to change its procedures so that passengers could read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing on the condition that they will remain in the "flight mode."
Passengers can already do it during the main part of the flight, but many annoying that they do not have access to its electronic books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers consider this decision, purebed from American airlines to spend a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they do not intend to in the near future to change its procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they consider this statement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in the critical phases of flight ​ ​ still operate in Australia.
"The safety of civil aviation currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices on planes," it said.
This issue is governed by rules that require airlines to ensure the maintenance of security at any time and from passengers - to comply with safety rules, which they say the crew members.
The company Virgin, which has already discussed with the expansion of civil aviation safety aboard its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not against the changes, but said that it will follow the directions of the regulator.
"We would have welcomed the review of the safety of civil aviation issues about resolving the use of electronic devices, because we really think that it will improve the quality of customer service now when she (onboard wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft," said the spokesman.
Qantas said it will adhere to the existing rules for the moment.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices may not be used during takeoff and landing, and in the near future, we are not going to change it," she said.
FAA decision applies to the American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit the passengers, and we will carefully study the FAA decision and the reasons that caused it.
U.S. carriers for the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Services will have to prove that their planes are resistant to radio disturbance from mobile devices, and revise the manuals, training materials, norms of the hand baggage and instructions for passengers.
"After the airline will check and confirm its diagnostic fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, easy electronic devices, such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases, poor visibility crew will be to instruct passengers to turn off their devices during the landing.
In addition, according to the group's recommendations, the heavier devices should be placed under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during takeoff and landing.
Obama rejects his words about health care
Among the storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday went up about his often portrayed, explicit promise that "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it."

Coulson used a phone hacking to verify the confidential messages
The former editor of the News of the World newspaper Andy Coulson allegedly used the "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" when trying to confirm the false information about the novel by Charles Clarke, who served in the post of Minister of the Interior.
The prosecutor royal lawyer Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World was unreliable news that Clarke meets with his "attractive special services" Han Colby.
The newspaper commissioned a private detective to hack voicemail Mulcaire Colby and steal her at home to take the interview, but Coulson also phoned her and left voice messages, "the court heard.
"The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW," he is not a man who will stand beside somebody's home, hoping to catch someone unawares, he is a man who likes to suggest a story for people to see what they say, "said Mr. Edis.
He said that the News of the World newspaper used three ways to investigate stories: Hacking phones, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor personally implicated in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about the surveillance, he simply must.
What about the first?
Did he know about the hacking phones?
He says that there is, we say: "Oh, yes!"
Rumors about the novel Clarke first attracted the attention of the newspaper News of the World when the source, sexually interested in Ms. Pyle, said: "Do not waste time, she with Charles."
Cassette with voice messages obtained from her phone at least three times, was removed from the house Mulcaire in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the computer of a private detective, in which Miss Colby and her sister involved as "Projects."
During the period when she was under observation, grandmother and grandfather of Ms. Pyle received anonymous calls to provide information about it, said Mr. Edis.
At that time, the former chief reporter Neville Turbek and former reporter James Weatherup controlled the spying on movements of Ms. Pyle.
Leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and I would like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edis said Coulson participation in this story happened on the same scenario, and with other influential people, for example, with former Minister of Internal Affairs David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson came into confrontation with Mr. Blunkett about the novel with a married woman while he met with teches Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied entry in collusion with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Turbek and Weatherup admitted hacking into phones.
The Interior Ministry bases there is no group "Community of the circle," to which the United States ranked Leps
In the databases of Russian security groups "Community of the circle," to which Washington has rated singer Grigori Leps, does not exist.
As noted, "Interfax" in Russian law enforcement agencies, after reports appeared in the media about the making of the US Treasury Department Grigori Leps in control lists on suspicion of belonging to a criminal syndicate Eurasian Community "circle," were checked all the databases, but the group has not been found.
Dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia" that supposedly operates abroad, believe in the law enforcement agencies.
"Even in the name of 'Community' circle, there is a certain element of mystique, contains a hint of a secret box.
"All this is very similar to the PR campaign," said the agency's interlocutor.
The US Treasury announced on October 31 digitization in their control lists on suspicion of belonging to a criminal syndicate Eurasian Community "circle," Arthur Badalyan, Gregory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalko and Igor Shlykova.
Individuals listed in this list, suspected of links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, which are considered influential members of criminal groups and are located in the US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier to deliver money on behalf of Vladislav Leontief."
At the heart of the producer's Grigori Leps refused to comment on the U.S. allegations against the singer, calling them "delusions."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama took syndicate "Community of the circle" to a number of "significant transnational organized criminal groups" and instructed Minfin "prevent and undermine their global criminal operations."

Scientists shed light on how the movement of the tail of the dog associated with her mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied the dog wild tail in the right side (from the point of view of a dog), while the dog alarmed pahing tail mainly on the left side.
But now scientists say that other members of the canid family can ignore these subtle differences in vilain tail and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from Trent University, says: "It is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain differently are involved in shaping the precursors that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here, we try to look at it and other species.
He added that as a person, dogs have the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to various piling tails of other dogs, the researchers observed animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of heartbeat of animals and analyzed their behavior.
Perhaps soon we understand why their tails sometimes goes to one side, and sometimes - in another
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the video dogs with dogs - or naturalistic version or silhouette in order to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and guide the tail more left or right."
When the animals seen that otherwise nothing conveyed the dog was driven by the tail to the right (from the point of view of a dog wily tail), they were completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail tended mostly to the left (again from the point of view of a dog wily tail), their heartbeat ass and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said that he does not think that dogs are deliberately communicated with each other using these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from his experience, about what movements they should worry, and what is not.
He says: "If there is a couple of meetings with other dogs and often vile them to one side of the tail is associated with a more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts on the basis of this experience."
The researchers say that these results may give the owners, vets and dresses a deeper understanding of the emotions of its animal.
An expert in the field of dog behavior John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at the Veterinary School of Bristol University, said that it was not the first study to examine whether the value for dogs left and right hand.
Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn your head to the left, if you look at an aggressive dog, and to the right, if you look at the devil dog.
And in another scientific work of the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "Dogs often approached dog-robot when its tail vile drawn to the left, not the right, rather than become alarmed," the opposite behavior toward the Italian study. "
He said that the difference could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies do not fully perceived animals in films or dogs and robots as dogs.
It might be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.
"While on various mammals, there is ample evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes, many details remain to be specified, and the dog is no exception," he said.
However, considering the ease with which may be registered their behavior is likely to soon we understand why their tails sometimes goes to one side, and sometimes - to another.
Is Europe's elite to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April, with the obligation to gather representatives of business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the UK want to see in relations with the EU.
To this end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK, business and the EU.
The company YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of business in the UK in size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise for many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking for export opportunities beyond Europe, paying particular attention to countries that hold modernization and grow, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government dad priority of the new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on a long and difficult process of reforming the complicated EU institutions.
When they were asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to the laws on products, the majority of business leaders believed that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
Presented general dissatisfaction with the single market and business representatives said that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits from the presence in Europe's trade zone, "agreed with this even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-minded of all companies.
The last and most indicative of our business leaders, the poll found that a clear majority wants the United Kingdom conducted a course on climate treaty and the relationship with the EU based on trade and not on politics.
This result, which was among the enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that the business insists on a "significant change" that will bring powers back to Britain.
The stakes are high - achieving changes in the treaty and more favorable conditions for the UK will provide a 16-percent shift in voting to remain in the EU.
The prime minister, there should be no doubt: This poll shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain's membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects that the review will lead to a significant shift in the balance of power back toward Britain.
The best conditions for British businesses are possible and become increasingly necessary as the eurozone comes on the path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given jobs and economic growth in the UK, and the results of our survey for business, it means the increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in the regulatory activities of Brussels.

In Siberia should not be going vegan: Tomato greenhouses could not replace super
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, the RIA Novosti correspondent iraq.org.
People who are completely withdrawn from animal products, do not have to live in Siberia.
Here, they do not transfer the winter without losses for health, and no hothouse tomatoes do not compensate them, consider to be interviewed on the eve of the Day of vegans Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors.
Drink l oil
Strict vegetarianism when refuse to not only from meat and fish, but also from the milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, doctors and nutritionists believe in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia to adhere to such stringent standards in nutrition, at least poles for health.
A complete rejection of animal products harmful.
In animal proteins are irreplaceable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for the plant.
We must necessarily include a diet at least milk or eggs, "says nutritionist Marina Bay.
She cites the example of the fish containing an indispensable fatty acid omega-3.
The most rich them vegetable oil, linseed.
"To consume it in the necessary for the person quantities, l need to drink!" Says nutritionist.
Doctors believe that the people of Siberia, special attention should be paid to the diet in the winter.
In this season of vegetarianism is particularly salient.
In terms of our realities, the demands made food.
To do not freeze, need a high calorie.
"If a person is limiting themselves on animal products, respectively, this caloric Monty," says the specialist.
With this agrees doctor-nutritionist Olga Spanish.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the solution.
It is better to eat mostly products, which are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is configured for the best entity and the acquisition of these products.
And in winter, people want to have not gone without driving and hot spa or even something post, "explains its position doctor.
She said that may have a vegan, really useful various grains, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples, remaining in the winter, frozen berries.
But this, clearly, is not enough for nutrition.
According to the doctor, a gastroenterologist Claudio Arifulina, Siberians in levels of vitamins sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
The full transition to vegetarianism in our hard natural conditions, when temperatures can change per day at 30 degrees and snow in May, necelesoobrazen.
Organism for life energy needs, and it is, above all, fat, "the physician concludes.
The doctors say that vegan diets especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need a construction material, including in the form of amino acids.
And adhering to vegetarianism, we give them incomplete.
Pregnant also need a high content of protein, vitamins and microelements in the menu.
"Vegas depost them," sure Bogan.
Arifulina says that a grown man can choose anything, "to play in those toys, which wants to."
He has already formed the body, the skeleton, organs.
And the children still need to eat efficiently.
If the parents rob him any micronutrients or amino acids, choosing for him that he will be there, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of those or other substances for the development of the brain, bones tomorrow is not reconstruct," she says.
All respondents specialists and doctors agree about the low quality of the winter crop in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What to bring and grown in greenhouses, contains fewer required us to trace elements than (grown) in the open ground.
"The quality of products is not something," says Begay.
Arifulina also notes that supplied and hothouse vegetables and fruits are far from perfect standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to collect more crop damages the quality.
"Apples do not become brown on the minerals, quickly turn yellow and plesneveut cucumbers, tomatoes and flashy aromatic" - gives examples of a physician, adding that they are likely to spoon excessive amounts of fertilizer.
And become suppliers are not vitamins and fiber.
With this disagrees zavlaboratoriei Siberian Physics and Technical Institute for Agricultural Issues, candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and observance of all standards and requirements in greenhouses may grow full-fledged vegetables.
If you are trying to nudge more with a square meter, then, of course, and the water will become more frequent, and perekarmlivat plants mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too much nitrogen fertilizer, tomatoes are increasing rapidly, they are large, but the aqueous and sliced almonds, "she explains, adding that the issue of quality, primarily depends conscience from the manufacturer.
Russia out of the struggle for urban pollution cars
Attempts to solve transportation problems of major cities were observed in most cities in the world since the second half of the 20th century.
As a rule, it was either about their rebuilding and expansion of highways, or about the attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and time of their use.
It is widely known example of Singapore, where introduced strict quota increase in the number of private cars, and the right to their acquisition is bought at auction.
Its price may be two to three times more than the price of the car.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry into the center of the city.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introducing the so-called green zone, which is allowed to enter only cars with certain eclass using high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric cars).
Beijing's environmental protection agency, for example, approved in 2012, "the five-year plan of clean air," with a total cost of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As told Kommersant, director of the Department of Transport pollution of the municipal environmental protection bureau of Beijing Li Kunsheng, the main aim of the plan is to reduce the major air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, the increase in the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), as well as the increase of no more than 5% of the use of fuel per one vehicle.
According to the agency, now vehicles in Beijing is responsible for 22.5% of the total air pollution.
Among the major measures of the program is to limit the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the urban measures "green" five include accelerated compared with the rest of the country's transition to ENs fuel, the introduction of the local system standards and labelling of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of cars in the central part of the city, a ban on the use of outdated vehicles (besides, the creation of a financial incentive programs to replace the old cars on hybrid or electric cars), the development of electric transport (including public and official), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Among automotive innovations in Beijing also include a ban on all private vehicles on the movement within the fifth ring transport (all in the Chinese capital, six of them) one day a week (relevant information is contained in the number sign of the vehicle), as well as the issuance of the registration numbers for the cars on the basis of the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number of 2010).
According to the existing Programme "Environmental Protection for 2012-2020," the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012, there were 138).
According to the Ministry, in 2011 on "mobile sources" had 41% of all emissions of pollutants in the atmosphere of the cities.
In Moscow, for example, the emissions from cars in ten times higher than the industry, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In the Russian Federation until just beginning to think about the possibilities of the restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
The director of the Institute of Economics of transport and transport policies HSE Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for car trips, is patently unpopular, they can be accepted by society only under the condition of their utter universality.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem associated with the structure of its fleet, where there are two cluster weakly sensitive to any regulatory impacts - official and personal cars, as well as the cars "privileged" users, the total number of not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total fleet of Moscow).
The other day urbanists will from the center of Expertize ECOM in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzed the balance of urban areas between residential development, the area of pavement and a number of vehicles.
The main findings of researchers: Downtown secured roads in two times less than the required, and the majority of motorists living in the city, do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in the car parks or on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking and storage of cars, not to expand and reduce roadway (to the streets became more friendly to pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the security zone of the historic center (with a total area of approximately 3212 hectares, covering a number of central districts of the city).
The increase in the price of fuel will lead the tax maneuver, which provides the mining tax increases (MET) for oil simultaneously with the decline in export duties and excise taxes.
According to experts, these measures could bring in additional budget 619,3 billion rubles.
The trip on the dirt, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon
Bell and his team spend almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country of doctors are not so much - just one in 5,000 people
Progolosuyte here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 main characters that he became the CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 for the continuation of his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father came back to life and again fell into the unconscious state, wandering around the hospitals, which were not properly equipped to help him.
Jameh Belle was injured in a car accident in 1981, not far from Yaounde, capital of Cameroon.
At first, he was only a broken arm, but the augmented infection spread to the brain and caused hematoma, which recalled about himself until the end of life.
"In Cameroon was not neurosurgeons," said Georges Bwelle.
If we had the money, we would have taken him from Cameroon.
Instead, Belle years accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment that they could get.
"It's not easy," said Belle.
"You can go out of the house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be first, but you are not the first.
Patients are very much.
Some may die due to the fact that they have to wait.
The situation is not much has changed since Belle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon, only one doctor for 5,000 people.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States - one doctor for 413 people.
And even if the Camerons could go to the doctor, many of them it would be unaffordable.
Two of the five people in this country are living below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the cost of health care in it are private.
"Their only problem is poverty," said Belle.
"And because of the poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives."
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his countrymen, Belle became determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers spent 700 free operations.
He became a doctor and a vascular surgeon at the Yaounde Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips into the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers had helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and even up to 30 people clod in vans, tie to the roofs medical supplies and cross-country travel to visit the need of assistance to the village.
It is not always brings good luck.
Not once they had to push the car through the river and dirt.
But when they arrive, they are the true heroes: This holiday with songs and dances and the best facilities, which can only offer local residents.
Free medical care in these villages really is a cause for celebration, and Belle with his broad smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the brigade begins to take hundreds of patients.
"We accept 500 people in each trip," said Belle.
They come from all over the neighborhood within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people are receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and diseases sexually transmitted infections.
Others may get the walkers, donated glasses or free birth certificate - documents needed for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the brigade spends a simple surgery under local anesthesia.
Operations, as a rule, are held in the building of the school, the municipality or at home; after the procedure, patients up and go into a persistent area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator for lighting operating and sanitary processing equipment, Belle and his volunteers are working until the early hours of Sunday.
It is a crippling pace, but the determination of the brigade usually help maintain the village musicians.
"They all night to beat the drums, so we were awake and continued to work," said Belle.
On Sunday, members of the brigade are sent back to the city, weary, but proud of his work.
The group, composed of Cameroon foreign doctors and medical students, has spent 700 free operations over the past year, and they know that their assistance can have enormous implications for those who they are helping.
One man explained that they received free surgery for a hernia treatment will allow him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical methods on weekends and work in a hospital surgeon Belle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It is this second work, he said, provides 60% of the financing of his nonprofit organization; the rest of the funds are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he sleeps," said Kathy O Malley, a second year student called Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer at Belle group.
He has always either in the hospital or trying to earn money for the organization to continue the campaign.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O 'Malley, coming from the United States and Europe to join the Belle in the implementation of its goals, it is an opportunity to practice that they would never have received at home.
"We were able to assist in operations where we helped to remove blood stains or keep the tools for Belle doctors," said O Malley.
As a student-sophomore, you would never have received such a possibility in America.
The students and volunteers are usually pay their travel to Cameroon, often coming from pojertvovanmi medicines.
But on arrival in Yaounde their food, transport and education pays Belle.
"He's a hero, without a doubt," said O Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon indefinitely.
For Belle almost constant workload of work is not a serious challenge.
Help to live a happy life to others, to fulfill the promise of his father is what brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this job," said Belle.
"And I think about my father.
I hope he sees that I do.
I do it so that people laughed in order to reduce their pain.
Go to the site ASCOVIME and see what you can help.
The "Russian mafia" in the United States will hold a new name - "Community of the circle."
This week, the black list of the "Russian mafia" in America replenished with new names and four companies.
The US Treasury introduced the "Community of the circle of the" three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israelis.
One of the Russians was a well-known singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States suspected of transporting money for the members of the group.
In all, the U.S. blacklist of 22 people involved in "brat circle," and six organizations affiliated with him.
Nevertheless, many experts have expressed doubts that this organization really exists.
"The statement of the 'Bratsk circle' more like an attempt to unite the disparate criminal gangs," said previously organized crime expert and professor at the University of New York, Mark galeotti.
In his opinion, "Community of the circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia."
"I haven't seen anyone in Russian law enforcement bodies or anywhere else, who would have confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization," Mr. Galleotti American Center for the Study of corruption and organized crime.
With Mr. Galleotti agrees and George Mason University professor Liz Shelley.
"If they work together, then it is more like a criminal network, but not the organization," - leads her words of the Center for Research on corruption and organized crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark galeotti suggested that the "Community of the circle" unites more confidants of Russian thieves in law Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandpa Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activity of the Ashkenazi Laci and Zacharias Kalashov, extended list in 2012, was closely connected with Grandfather Khasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, Hasan had bison nephew.
Yet Mr. galeotti notes that some of the personality and does not have a relationship to Usoyan.
In his opinion, all of them united, rather common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the "Community of the circle," Grigori Leps - the beloved singer Russian President Vladimir Putin - attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we hope that we get from our American colleagues and partners for more detailed information, and the decision was made, why he was in such lists have made, "said the president's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all the citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.
Tony Blair has said that he will use the chance to return as prime minister of Britain, but admits that the return is unlikely.
On the eve of the night in an interview on the fifth anniversary of the departure from his post, a 59-year-old politician outlined their views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since leaving office in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussion of British politics, limiting most of their comments by foreign affairs and his role as ambassador of the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers.
Answering a question whether he would have returned to the post of prime minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely to happen, so..."

The British police presents Assange extradition notice
British police today handed a notice about the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London and requested asylum.
At Scotland Yard said that they have a 40-year-old Australian "official requirement to surrender" to come to the police station, adding that in case of failure of this requirement, it will be more subject to arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual crimes after he exhausted its possibilities in accordance with British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm will transfer him to the United States, on June 19, he took refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London, asking for this South American country of political asylum.
Scotland Yard "handed the 40-year-old man, a formal requirement to surrender, which obliges him to come to the police station in the day and time for our choice," the spokesman said.
He continued to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy refused to comment on the presentation of the police.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to charge him with the possible charges of espionage after the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic Depeche to anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
Now the Roman Sechin is located in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Altyshov" translated into French.
Recall, that his novel became a finalist four prizes: In all respects, "" Russian Booker, "" National bestseller "and" Big Book. "
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded the prize of the government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
The novel Sechin - clearly the leader in the current generation of thirty-year-and-somethings prose writers.
Virtually every publication of his hard, based on modern life stories material causes hot debate among critics of different directions.
You can argue that collected together articles about the prose and journalism Senna, reviews of his books and magazine articles create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s until the beginning of 2010.
In discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial modern writers," according to the criticism of Sergei Chuprina, for the most part is that its participants understand the word "literature" how they see the present and the future, not only of our literature and life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book is not allowed to include most of the articles and reviews of the regional media and the blogosphere.
The analytical and review articles are generally in the reduction in the sections "Paragraphs..."
J. Snowden may interrogate in Russia
Ex-US intelligence worker Edward Snowden, most likely, will not travel outside Russia to testify on business is done on the telephone conversations of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As stated, "Interfax" on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the Americans can answer the questions of the General Prosecutor's Office of Germany in writing or internally in Russia.
Trip Edward J. Snowden beyond Russia virtually eliminated.
"In this case, he will lose refugee status and may be issued by Washington countries - American allies," said the agency's interlocutor.
"However, in principle, the office of Germany could send their representatives in Russia or convey Snowden written questions," said the source, adding that the issue should be elaborated on the international level.
Earlier, a member of the German Bundestag Hans-Kristian Strebel reported that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of the German Chancellor done by American special services negotiations.
Snowden is ready to give testimony by German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
Ex-CIA officer made it clear that knows very much.
Despite the fact that the NSA, the US blocked all his movement, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
But to do that we need to clearly define the conditions of his arrival, "said Stroebele Euronews channel.
J. Snowden's lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement, "Interfax source," said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how - will decide itself.
The US citizen Edward Snowden, who worked at the National Security Agency (NSA), the US and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which spread information about secret U.S. intelligence operations on surveillance on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow transit, but could not leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was rescinded by the US authorities, in absentia provide him serious accusations, and until the beginning of August, remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport. "
On August 1, Snowden received a document to grant him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and on the same day left Sheremetyevo. "
Yesterday, an American lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said that his client took a job in a "major Russian company."
About the NSA surveillance for Angela Merkel last week, German media reported.
According to the journalists, phonecalls Chancellor, the Americans began to listen back in 2002.
A tracking station allegedly was in the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities after the publication of this information, said that the surveillance for Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
It was announced about the issue of the racing series of Land Rover
Inside are racing seats and shestitochechnse seatbelts, as well as the internal communications system.
Additionally, you can get the upgraded brakes, a package of services, providing access to the mechanic Bowler Works, logistical support and storage of the car between the events.
Drew Bauler, managing director of the company Bowler Motorsport, said: "The participants of the rally traded at Bowler, changed."
Some of them are not experienced riders, and people seeking excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with the Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different disciplines rally in the UK and abroad, as well as prepare participants to the harsh conditions and realities of the rally-raid.
We are pleased to have developed a car Defender Challenge - it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to take part in events in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East.
Children must study the myths and legends as "model of lifestyle," says the author.
Stories about the Torah could show that "brute force cannot win the refined trick," and the legend of King Arthur shows how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many of the myths are "too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools," Crossley-Holland stands for "careful selection" suitable for the age of texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I spoke for the introduction of their training program in twenty years.
He added that "excessive moralism" authors and teachers "guards of interest" in children, and the basic ideas "sublime" into a fascinating history.
Crossley-Holland, who translated "Beowulf" with the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote "Collection of Norwegian myths" for publishers Penguin and "British folk tales," said: "You, of course, may be the intention, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between adult author, a writer for adults, and adults by the author, a writer for children, is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy end, but it is necessary to be innate understanding of good and evil.
And it should be sublime; solved through the story, but not clearly formulated.
The old principle: To show, not tell.
Goldman Sachs warned of the risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks for the main driver fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
It is primarily a crisis of arrears on unsecured consumer loans and layoffs.
Our main concern now is not what growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.
Lately he's totally driven by consumption, which is almost not lifting the turnovers, "said Goldman Sachs chief economist for Russia, Clemens Grafe, presenting Quarterly Report investment bank yesterday on the Russian economy.
Now, the nominal wage growth in Russia - about 10%.
With inflation at 6%, he will be able to ensure the future consumer demand around the current level, expect to Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies falls, however, most likely, they will optimize staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: If wages are rising by 10% of GDP - only 2%, "explained Mr. Graf.
Companies were faced with declining profitability.
If it does not grow, it could lead to layoffs and rising unemployment.
Do not raise the salaries of Russian business may not, said Barclays Capital's chief economist for Russia and the CIS, Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment near historical lows, the competition for workers is high.
In order to attract employees from or keep the current, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia power ­ potrebcreditovania jets and very fast growth.
According to Mr. Graf, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans multiplicative effect on the economy of the country, this type of lending does not.
"Potrebcreditovania pools for the economy from the growth we did not see any of the money does not differ on the economy and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments," said the economist.
But the problem in another - at Goldman Sachs expect growth in arrears on unsecured credit.
They are mostly rich people who have nothing to offer the software.
The interest on such loans high.
As a result, they often do not return, "said Mr. Graf.
Therefore, the second threat to growth in Russia - a possible crisis arrears on unsecured credit.
The director of the Banking Institute of Economics, Vasily Solodkov now sees signs of their looming banking crisis.
Small credit organizations without access to cheap resources, which have owned banks were forced to raise funds for the population at a high interest rate.
In response, the state budget went on the warpath and began to cut lending rates, "the economist continued.
Small credit organizations cannot lend loans under the same interest, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state budget will not abandon dumping, Russia threatens to full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
A holder of the licenses of some banks in recent weeks, the economist believes the harbinger of mass collapse.
"The state budget couldn't cope with such a situation: The deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," the head of the institute.
But consumption growth will slow and without the crisis of arrears, believed in Investbank, "due to the refusal of indexing salaries of civil servants and the military, inherent in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the blow to the consumption will be reduced tariff freeze natural monopolies (and, as a consequence, the decline in inflation).
But only partially: If investments don't rise (and there are no preconditions for this - see certificate), consumption growth is still slow, sure of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital until it sees the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still fall in oil prices," he says.
In his estimation, Russia's economy will shrink at the price of oil below 90 dollars per barrel.
At Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank has not been able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradox: Inflation has fallen, and banks have been raising rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, a renegade targeting transition to inflation, "said Clemens Grafe.
The interest policy of the Central Bank on market rates do not affect, affects only the interbank lending rates.
"For the Central Bank is the failure of all the hopes," praised Clemens Grafe.
The money received at auctions of the Central Bank, banks are not lending to the economy and to manage its liquidity
Once the reduced rate, immediately changing the exchange rate, it means that the funds are trying to leave on speculation against the ruble.
"Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Graf and reminded that let the ruble in a "free float" state plans by the end of 2015.
But will have to either do it sooner, or raise a key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he said.
In his estimation, the rate of the ruble now artificially overvalued by 10%.
Ruble only one road is weakening, "concludes the expert.
But if the Central Bank seront financial specialists in a shadow of a doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy on the weakening of the ruble, it could bring the ruble is much stronger.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's done
The member of the Bundestag, Hans-Kristian Stroebele met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the conversation, discussed whether Snowden may be questioned as a witness in the trial of the German Prosecutor about possible US specsltujbami Chancellor of the phone is done.
Snowden expressed a willingness to give the necessary evidence.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, "said Hans-Kristian Strebel - which knows very much.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency under the Keith Alexander blocked all his movement, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, the first need to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival..
Meanwhile, US lawmakers are starting to take action in response to the scandal surrounding the U.S. spy programs.
Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved the bill, sparkling enclave additional restrictions on the activities of the American electronic intelligence agency.
Fau: "Air passengers can now use the gadgets on planes (but not call from a mobile phone)."
Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but did not speak on mobile phones, "according to a long-awaited new guidelines, published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect that the changes occur immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, said FAA Administrator Michael Worth Botanic Garden at a press conference.
Companies will have to show the FAA as their planes meet the new guidelines and that they update their textbooks for members of the flight crew and rules for the installation of devices to meet the new guidelines.
Fau announced that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on airplanes.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines, which have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the state of the plan we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices, as soon as the plane door is closed.
They do not have to restart them until the plane did not reach the heights of 10,000 feet and the captain did not give "good."
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane goes down for planting, and do not include them until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, the airlines whose planes properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and steering, the FAA said.
Most of the new airliners and other planes, modified so that passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, is expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of professional stewards, welcomed the changes.
"After the new policy will be implemented safely (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win solution," said Glading.
We are frankly tired of feeling "duty on the school" when it comes to this issue.
But the connection to the Internet for surfing, exchange of emails, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
Thus, still no "Words with Friends" - the intellectual online game, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011, when there was a notable case: The actor was removed from an American Airlines flight for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the plane was at the gate.
And more severe devices, such as laptops, still need to be carried in the luggage, because they can injure someone if they fly around the salon.
Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also remain banned.
Regulation powers on telephone calls are owned by the Federal Communications Commission, and not the FAA.
Fau may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Council for Transport Safety, a national security expert at the carriage of CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered risky.
"Cell phones is really a problem, not only because they can potentially create obstacles for navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCC that they may interfere with cellular towers when the plane is in the air," said Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to study the issue, recommended last month that the government has authorized the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, heightening the pressure on the FAA to easing restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator from Missouri Democrat Claire McCaskill, argue that there is no good reason for prohibitions related to security.
Compliance with the restrictions also becomes increasingly difficult to provide, as the use of the devices has become commonplace.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions turn off their devices.
Fu began to limit the use of passengers of electronic devices in 1966, in response to reports of impediments encountered for navigation and communications equipment, when the passengers began to wear a FM radios - high-tech gadgets of the time.
The new airplanes are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of planes, but they are also being developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines are offering passengers to use Wi-Fi for cruising altitude for several years.
The planes, modified for Wi-Fi systems, also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of the aircraft adapted for wider use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, said Worth Botanic Garden.
Today's electronic devices usually emit radio much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading electronic books, for example, emit only minimal signals at relisted pages.
But the signals are becoming more powerful when downloading devices or send data.
Among those who sought easing restrictions on the use of the passengers of electronic devices, the company Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives have downloaded a airliner with their devices for reading electronic books the Kindle and flew on it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the advisory committee of the FAA expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices pose any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of airline passengers said he believes interference from the actual devices, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only some of the messages pilots, confirming that the device may interfere with the aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.
Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAA has allowed pilots to require passengers to disable the device during landings on devices in poor visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed the changes, calling them sensible step toward passengers who now use a lot of technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAA acknowledges that the comfort of passengers is not inconsistent with safety and protection," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out informational provocations against senior officials of Lithuania and the countries of the Eastern Partnership - the agency BNS made in the republic's state security department (DGB).
Information about it published on the portal DELFI.
According to the message, in particular, Moscow intends to "negotiate" Lithuanian President Grybauskaite Dahl and publish fraudulent documents allegedly found in the Russian Gosse concerning the facts of the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the security services, the preparation of the informational attacks leads Department analysis of public governance processes of Russia's presidential administration for Interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
Структуру headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, not once attended Lithuania and took part in the Congress of the People's Party.
It is also a member of the operation allegedly is an employee of the Department of Vladimir Smirnov.
According to security service, Smirnov under the guise of scientific work until the end of 2012, regularly came to Lithuania and contact with local politicians, political scientists and representatives of the media.
Now Smirnova not permitted to enter the country.
On the eve of the Lithuanian President Grybauskaite said that knows about the upcoming informace on it.
In her opinion, the main reason is the successful chairmanship of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and the country's commitment to energy independence. "
The Lithuanian leader previously not once criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So, she claimed that the Kremlin to Lithuania are "insufficiently respectful."
In addition, Grybauskaite accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin's nomination to Lithuania "requirements alone."
Recall in September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of the Lithuanian "mole" in Russia.
Ball that the quality of the products do not comply with sanitary norms.
Then the Lithuanian leader said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the government of the country must prepare the appeal to the WTO.
The new antinicotine vaccine may deprive the process of smoking pleasure
The scientists have developed antinicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before the trials on humans, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the first results are reassuring.
"We very much hope that such a strategy of using a vaccine may finally help millions of smokers who try to quit, Surrogate all methods available on the market today, but discovered that their nicotine dependence strong enough to overcome it with the help of these modern facilities," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies stalked by any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker nicotine strike.
The mouse vaccine tests, which subsequently gave the nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mouse, which did not give the vaccine, "rasslablalisy," and it is a sign that nicotine reached out to their brain, "say the researchers.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccine failed because they contain antibodies.
In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to do so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns the liver cells in the factory antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it could give the children before they will be willing to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will know that if they begin to smoke again, they do not get the pleasure of a nicotine vaccine, and it may help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but warned that further studies are needed.

Frontier Airlines will charge a fee for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for what they sneaked hand luggage on board his flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda pop, although their announcement on Wednesday's verdict that passengers will be able to leave the rest of the bank.
The new hand baggage fee applies to the bag in the upper luggage compartments, however small bags, placed under the seat remain free.
Frontier said that it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelling will pay only caught at the gate.
Predstavitelnita Frontier Kate O Malley said that a fee of $100 should make the passengers take care about the payment in advance.
"We do not want to charge for it," she said.
The carriers have started to charge for the first and second bag, probably in luggage, in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these fees, the line as much as they can in hand baggage, placed in upper luggage compartments, these compartments are often not enough space.
Fees is one of the ways to get carry fewer passengers on board.
O 'Malley said that this new fee is actually not for the sake of making money.
The point is that the most loyal customers of the Frontier say that finding a place in the upper luggage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the website of the airline, does not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the Frontier flight may get the opportunity to carry the bag for free, while another passenger in the queue may pay $100 for the same bag.
O 'Malley said that changing the procedures on the web site and at check-Frontier intended to ensure that passengers will know about gathering before they get to the gate.
The new collection of Frontier for hand luggage will not apply until the summer, although the date has not been set.
Passengers often complain of fees for baggage and other fees, but the airline of their love.
They argue that the baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service, should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street believe adding baggage fees sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses.
However, the majority of them are not touched fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. has introduced the first hand baggage fee three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other airline with such a gathering is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the extra fees.
In his assessment in a report from December 2011, hand baggage fee brings the Spirit of $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew flight Spirit, and he was wondering what he finds at the gate, where passengers will face an unusual collection of Spirit for hand luggage.
"The landing was very smooth from those that I have seen in my career in the airlines," he said.
I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing was rapidly."
Frontier also follows the Spirit of fee of $2 for coffee, tea, soda pop or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who get soda pop or juice, can leave yourself all the bank and that Dole coffee will be provided free of charge.
She still will be handing out free water.
Us Airways while trying to charge for drinks in 2008, but abandoned it after seven months after the passengers began to complain and no other major airline has not followed her example.
The initiative to levy the Frontier hand baggage fees when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last resort to attract customers on its Web site.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
It gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, and does not apply to the online travel agency.
However, the Frontier went further than all in this area.
In September, she began to give two times less bonus miles often flying passengers to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday presale she cut the number of miles up to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.
Thus, the trip to 1,000 miles from the Frontier, acquired by the online travel agency, would get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the site of the Frontier.
The Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown of Denver, but its business is declining and becomes unprofitable.
Revenue fell by 9 percent, and flight opportunities fell by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial results, published on Wednesday parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to mend finances Frontier within the sale of the airline.
Putin has made impunity for his friend of Assad
And now, the news from the ocean, namely - from Syria, where, as we learned today, Israel dealt a blow to the Russian-made missiles, which reportedly were intended "Hezbollah."
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - November 1 to destroy its chemical weapons production.
This was done in the framework of the agreement reached under the mediation of Russia and enabled the US not to conduct a military operation to which they closely came this summer.
Learn more about weapons and what it all means for the Syrian president, will tell our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington said that Assad's regime will be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from the poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of U.S. bombing, and in the form of a deal that gave a friend of Assad - Vladimir Putin.
Syria relinquish its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria knocked out unannounced factory for the production of chemical weapons.
A more long-term and hard task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components to it.
As we understand, it is about a thousand tons.
Previously, Washington said that Assad's days are numbered.
I believe that Assad must go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it happens.
He is no longer legitimate and must go.
But Assad remains.
And feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly equipped.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many go hungry.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The agreement of the Chemical Weapons Convention called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad made the impression of a man ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the U.S. ambassador in Syria had to answer the tough questions.
When a child dies from hunger, his mother is hardly easier from what he was not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is held.
And changes the weapons on power.

Tomsk Leninsky District Court sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory work resident of the city, which posted on the social network video extremist orientation, RIA Novosti reported on Friday, a representative of the press service of the regional court.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted on his page on the popular social network footage, which put on the federal list of extremist materials.
For it was opened a criminal case under article of the Criminal Code "actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as the humiliation of the dignity of the person committed publicly."
"The Leninskiy District Court considered the case in a special procedure and found a man guilty of committing the crimes, appointing the punishment of 240 hours of mandatory works," said the agency's heroine.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Parents intersexual children can choose the "uncertain floor."
Germany became the first European country that recognized the third floor of the children born to the exterior intermediate type.
Broden will no longer need to attribute the male or female gender.
The new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children, allowing parents to specify the floor as an "uncertain" or "undetermined" in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who can take hasty decisions about operations for Assigned newborn sex, and counteract discrimination intersexual people.
One intersexual people, according to the BBC, said many years later: "I am not a man and not a woman."
I will stay created doctors patchwork of product with bruises and scars.
About one out of two thousand children born each year, is neither a boy or girl.
They intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of "violations of sexual development" is a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (mines or seeds) or unusually ravishing exterior.
Wallis Simpson, perhaps was intersexual.
Gender identification is still poorly studied, but most experts in the US say that if the floor cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign him than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the surgery, if it happens at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds like a good idea."
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have a life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention, but the majority of children do not have them," he said.
You can assign the floor without the surgery and then see how develops personality.
Science about how the child will develop any gender identity, not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It is like a mystery about why people being homosexual.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersexual people as different from the transgender or transgender, because their condition is not disaggregated, but to their biological structure that does not correspond to exclusively neither male nor female, and typically for both simultaneously or not typical for either one of them.
These characteristics may emerge in secondary sexual symptoms such as muscle mass, hair distribution, chest and physique; primary sexual symptoms, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and regenerating.
The report also gives a general idea of discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
The boys with gender disorders now has a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put a male, female or "third gender" in its official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia Welby-year, police became the first person in the world, acknowledged "pole," having upheld in court the right to preserve "vague" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passports will be used by a third designation in addition to M & F-X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighboring France, gender issues still cause contradictions, according to a news release on the channel France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this strongly Catholic country, signed a petition to confiscate a "gender theory" of school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online Web site also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is involved in a new state, where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity - no, we still Praid two pillars of civilization."
One mother of the newborn baby from Maryland also told the Web site Baby Zone that she would prefer that the children set the floor at birth.
"Raise child is difficult and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child," she said of the Web site for parents.
The children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sex organs, called hermaphrodites - named a beautiful Greek god who wielded the characteristics of both sexes.
And yet, just ten years ago, the medical community stand gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything, and then draw again.
But now, many are questioning the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will be assigned to perceive him to the floor as an adult.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called" urgent mental case "," Drescher said.
When such children were born, you are not called psychiatrist - you rang the surgeon.
Dominating theory about how to deal with children with genitals intermediate type, was proposed by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the gender easily amenable to change.
He introduced the term "gender identity" and argued that the signals of the environment, including social - how parents raise the child, "interact with genes and hormones of the child, determining whether people consider himself a man or woman.
But in one case, 1966, known as the "John / Joan" his theories have been called into question.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during the negligent circumcision, fully castrate child, removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it was not true," Drescher said.
When he was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
But in the 38 years he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now, some doctors are still "apply this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived the sex-change operation, said about himself, "unhappy with the result."
Such was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from the state of Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but genitals intermediate type.
Doctors could not accurately determine whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a "normal life" men.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, the external sexual organ and testicles Bruce were surgically removed, and he was brought up as a girl.
He began to give female hormones at the age of 12 years.
"I knew that I was not a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
In the 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty.
But being in depression and realizing that something is wrong, he demanded the medical documentation.
What he learned, it was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one has ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a violation of sexual development, which gave him the body to produce enough testosterone for the normal development of the genitals.
Learning the truth, he again became a man, receiving injections of testosterone and removing their breasts.
The operation has made his fruitless.
Today, he is acting in defense of others in the organization under the name Interface Project, trying to lead a normal perception of people with intersexuality.
But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California legal association Advocates for informed Choice, concerned that the German law "urges labelled and stigma."
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to take hasty decision and give the child" uncertain "floor," she said.
We are afraid that he will promote the intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign a male or female sex, and then wait.
But we have not seen the show themselves this law, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, because "it allows adults to make a choice in favor of the third floor."
"Adult people should have the opportunity to make their own decisions about the formal sex," she says.
The German law implies its assignment at birth.
It is a battle in which young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow, then they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, mammal ultrasound diagnostician from Pittsburgh, which has a daughter with a violation of sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law "support" as parents and children.
Bart daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a violation of sexual development called "full nechuvstvitelnosti syndrome to androgens."
Because its androgenic receptors are working correctly, Kathy developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but there is no uterus and ovaries.
Now, at 29 years, Kathy married and passes studies in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite the fact that she is barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy motherhood.
"The law gives parents the time not to take hasty decisions by themselves," said Bart.
He gives them time to do some tests and understand the situation, as well as the period of time before they write "male" or "female."
In this case, you in order to raise a child, like a child.
Do you have a wonderful child, and you feel the joy.
We don't need to hastily to do the operation that is irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that motivates parents, because they do not feel they are doing the right thing," she said.
After all, the child will decide how floor he or she is more comfortable - and it is wonderful.
It gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.
The US secretary of state: The security services sometimes "went too far" when collecting data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry conceded that when collecting data and sometimes slacks American intelligence agencies "went too far," the politician nonetheless noted that appeared in the media is done about 70 million people do not correspond to reality.
I assure you that innocent people during this process will not be affected, but the attempt to gather information was.
Yes, in some cases, it came too far and was proper character.
I admit it recognizes and the president... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future, "AFP quoted Secretary of State.

Completely unfamiliar people in the arena thought him so phenomenal that wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebb-Weil in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt, Sharon Howell, which sets the horses for more than 10 years.

The court suspended the execution of the decisions on the practice of "stop-iost" in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court suspended the execution of the court decision, demanding changes in the program "stop-iost" New York Police Department, and ousted the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the second US District said that the execution of the decisions of a judge Shira Scheindlin will be suspended pending the outcome of appeals filed city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how he performed a program on the street detention and interrogation.
The city appealed on its decision and the decision of the corrective measures, including a requirement to appoint the controller to help the police department to change work practices and related training program.
On Thursday, the appeals court heard oral hearing on the request to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal said about the need to remove judges due to the fact that she violated the Code of Conduct of U.S. Judges and not posts with the need to avoid demonstrations of bias, partly due to a series of interviews to the media and official statements containing the public response to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unreasonably referring to black and Hispanic under the program "stop-iost."
It has appointed an external controller for the supervision of large-scale changes, which include reforms in the field of policies, training and oversight, and decided to launch a pilot program for testing on the body assigned video cameras in police stations, where most of the detentions.
In August, New York came to the decision to stop the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people, work on which were stopped after the police checks.
Debates on appeal of the city must take place after the March 14, 2014.
Tactics "stopped and searched" criticised many lawyers in civil rights.
"Stop-and-search" practiced for several decades, in one form or another, but the number of documented stops increased sharply during the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching a record in 2011 at 684 330 people, most of them blacks and Latinos.
In 2004, four people, all - representatives of national minorities, filed a class action filed in court.
Supporters of the changes in the program "stop-iost" in the New York Police Department said that these changes will end unfair practices, to forge a more reliable and effective police service and can affect how other police departments implement this practice.
Opponents argue that the changes reduce the morale of police, rather than the level of criminality, will lead to unnecessary expenditure of money and will not solve a global problem of complex conditions in police due to reduce the number of officers at several thousand over the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of "stop-iost" that complies with the constitution, but changes the way how New York police stops of people.
Azarov promised Ukrainians crash in prices for goods after the signing of the association with the European Union
Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices will fall significantly in the country after the country will sign an association agreement with the European Union.
He said during a conversation with readers of his page on Facebook. "
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a number of factors, including, including, and customs duties.
Now, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions of the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will fall significantly.
And it will mean that the prices should fall.
"This is what concerns the goods that are coming from the EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be mediated.
But, nevertheless, there also should not be rising prices.
So the message on the billboard, which recently appeared quite a lot in our country that the association with the EU is a growth of prices, it is not quite true, or if more accurate to say - not so, "Azarov summed.
The rescue measures in the amount of $325 million for Tasmania's Health
The federal government insists that the bailout package of $325 million for Tasmania's weak health systems will be supplemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the state government did not spend the money wasted.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent measures" to prevent the crisis caused by the aging of the population of this island state, higher levels of chronic disease and system constraints.
The decision on funding for four years, was taken after consultation with the government of Tasmania's deputy independent Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which, we believe, will solve specific problems facing state," said Ms. Plibersek today.
The package of $325 million includes $31 million on a blitz-campaign for planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and surgery to remove cataracts, will help bridge the gap.
There is also money for clinics that accept patients without reservation, in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care after the patient, the training of medical specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals.
"These investments will go on leading doctors expressed by the implementation of ideas on how best to help Tasmania's health system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The minister insisted that Tasmania's government will work in a strict accountability and responsibility.
State will need to maintain the current levels of funding in order to receive the funds of the Commonwealth, and the monthly report about where he spends these additional funds.
The commission will be created from three people to make sure that the state provides services as more efficient and powerful.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will solve nothing, "if they do not follow the real reform that will put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable basis."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for a response to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first asked the prime minister at the beginning of May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will greatly facilitate the withdrawal of the state of the health care system from a critical condition," said Mr Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional selective procedures are largely offset recent cuts.
But the federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement represents "solution, a similar leycoplasteru."
"The reason we are here is that the state Labor government ripped $430 million from the health care system," he told ABC television TV.
When the government lifts the state almost half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth is investing 300 million, you cannot pretend that this is good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek guarantee that no one dollar from the rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The scream of desperation Obama's voter
I voted for President Obama twice, dividing the hope for the possibility of change
He says that Obama has allowed obstructionism Republicans nullify laudable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify the problems with the website reformer Obama health care system, the drone attacks
Memoirs of Obama's campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder that could be
Nathaniel P. Morris, a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I read a terribly sad book these days.
I thought that this book will inspire me in times of gloom in the second year of medical faculty and revive in me a sense of hope.
It is called "dare for victory," and it's memoirs of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish the evening to write reports on my patients and go to bed, this book brings me at a time when the policy inspired millions of people, and the speech could capture the spirit.
The victory in the elections was formidable, and the leading news programs were doing a pause for reflection of this historical moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents who guarded all the newspapers that they could find.
At the White House had come a young team of strategists, and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's entry into the office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Return at present is a rude awakening, as verging of dreams.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism - they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years that have passed since I dropped his first ballot, the changes actually occurred.
It was something that I could not even imagine.
I give Obama credit for his large and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the abolition of rules of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the party has blocked obstructionism too many attempts to promote our country forward: Immigration reform, the choice of public health and the closure of the base at Guantanamo, among others.
But after countless number of times when I've been on the side of the Obama administration, defending her in front of colleagues and peers, I ended the explanation that I can provide.
I reached a point of political despair.
Obstructionism Republicans cannot explain the permission to prosesu foreign leaders or striking pilots on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the collection of data about the private lives of Americans, the National Security Agency or the persecution of the whistleblower, outlines the government's misconduct.
He could not explain the murder of an American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, without charge or trial or failure to comply with the limits of public financing and spending during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which says that the attachments White House effort to silence the media, are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And lately he cannot justify what cannot develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable medical care.
I don't know whether I should expect it.
Should I was at the age of 18 years to understand that the administration may contradict the political campaigns that precede him?
It is obvious that the work on an elective office is not a predictable program of action, because our public dialogue will be formed an opposition political party and random events such as the carnage in Newtown.
Yet for all listed above me examples show that they were largely on their own choice of administration.
And this is what bothers me most of all.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an obvious and crass alternative, it seemed that he was not in a position to make a decision on their own policies or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, meets that we've heard for so long.
However, when this week, Obama's approval rating dipped below 45%, back in 2008 through this book has become much more difficult.
It makes me homesick for many promises that uletuchilisy.
This week I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton dealt Obama deafening defeat in the primary election in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting on the analysis of the causes of the failure, he told his employees that they should go back to normal and remain true to its goal.
"I want that we returned our appeal," he said.
"We must remember about who we are."
It has been five years, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.

In Egypt, takes the oath, the first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi takes the oath, but his day celebrations will return unlikely an end to the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when taking an oath, becoming the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 black-robed judges in the court building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that most of the 84 years of its existence was banned organization round, a target for tough action by successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen, when Morsi arrived with a small cortege shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to greet the new president, and, unlike the presidential fanfare Mubarak's era, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his convoy on the normally busy road linking the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi uncharismatic ridiculed as "spare wheel," "Brothers," his personal prestige has risen sharply since his victory and headline performances, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate, not just Islamists, but also all those who want to bring the matter before the end of the 2011 uprising against Mubarak's authoritarian.
"Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Morsi, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, the judges in obit wood panelling hall where he took the oath.
Later, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to pronounce his inauguration speech.
He was provided an official reception with the army orchestra to land the national anthem, during which he stood at attention. "
Products military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.
His arrival was met with the slogan "Army and the people are one hand" who chanted hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s, has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising began, servivce Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and promised to return the powers of the president, which his office was deprived of the military council that has made the case against the deposed leader.
But agreeing to accept the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he performs the will of the military, and it is a sign that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatre populist gestures.
Schools urged to pay more attention to the math, spelling and grammar
School courses of English literature will require that students have studied at least one Shakespeare play, the novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and modern British fiction since 1914.
The exam will also be presented "programme texts" to encourage a more extensive reading.
Joint course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015, pupils will be required to pass a separate exam in language, with assertive recommendations of the choice of English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education will tomorrow release a new training programs for English and math - the first subjects subjected to the radical revision.
He will make changes in other major items in the next year.
Separately, the regulator in exams OFQUAL will present a revised structure of the high school final exams, with a new system of assessments and less coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said he was "reached a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," insisting that the school graduation exams will be "more challenging, more ambitious and more stringent."
Studies show that English schools devote less time mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, the Australian schools give an average of 143 hours per year, and in Singapore, students are about 138 hours.
Although the formal requirements to spend more time in the schedule of mathematics will not, coalition sources said that large-scale school graduation exams in math, combined with an increased coefficient rating in the table, likely will serve as an incentive to provide additional training schools on this subject.
The curriculum will be focused on the "challenges of real life," including financial mathematics.
Football is a cause of discord?
In the Duma within the "Open tribune" politicians and experts were talking about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals sounded and this: Prohibit football in the North Caucasus, because of this game - some scandals and discord.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin reminded about the recent events in Biryulevo and said that in order to reduce the degree of tension in society, "politicians and the media should be careful in the statements.
Perhaps he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovski, who at one of the programs threatened to encircle the Caucasus barbed wire, if they do not want to limit the birth rate...
All speakers talked and on measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and on measures to harmonize relations between peoples, occupying Russia, which made sunburst discussion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that events in Biryulevo - "the conflict that could predict," but "for these questions we meet too many people and the courts," and many child without the eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which for a long time against migrants practicing Europe, according to the army personnel, failed, and we need to find their way.
Historic Yuri Petrov pinned high hopes on a new single textbook history.
"It is necessary to create the cultural history of the peoples of the country to schoolchildren in Tatarstan knew that for people living in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyuganov has proposed to criminalize the "appeals to dismember Russia": "If the United States said on the radio that we should give Alaska of Russia, then arrested and will give you 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard, "not create."
As usual, in everything he accused journalists who get sick and sharp national problems on public discussion: "In the heat of polemics knows what to say!"
The leader of the United Russia faction, "Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised reporters to sign a" charter "and agree to talk on the subject carefully, and then the same obligations may take and politics.
We have taken about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the whole procedure is installed, said Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that imposes on regional and municipal authorities responsible for ethnic peace on their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko delight about this law is not divided: There is no "clear understanding of what the adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits.
So the actors will be interpreted in different ways, the volume of these powers.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the resources needed to solve such a complicated issues, there is no money and methodical recommendations, which they could use, the center does not give them...
The head of the Duma Committee for Nationalities Gajimet Safaraliev offered to create a special agency with a formidable name "Department of Homeland Security," which would have dealt with the issues of national policy.
But Valery Artem, who in the 1990s headed a similar agency, pressed subsequently, opposed.
It is enough to have at the federal level, a special person, "the minister without portfolio," which could be addressed, if that.
"We walk on the edge of the shells are snapping close, it is very important to the representatives of different ethnic groups and religions together against the provocations, and this work must receive a decent informational support," said a spokesman for the ROC for relations with society Vsevolod Chaplin.
No state neutrality toward dangerous ideologies, including religious, to be, in his opinion, should not.
Here, Oleg Nilov drew debate in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, another search is necessary, but don't push them on the road, not on the road," he said.
"Not the way" is the development of football: "The football player beaten the entire crowd, then burned flags, comrades stones pelt each other...
May not need us to such a football?
There is another kind of sport - rugby is called...
"Rave they will not be in the world in this sport!" - hotly cross said.
Rugby in the Caucasus, no one will not play! - immediately intervened Mr. Zhirinovsky.
You still curling them to offer!
We need to know the identity, it is still what grousing "Zaporozhets" offer... "
In Yaroslavl wild behavior in the stands made by representatives of the Moscow club - during the game with a local club.
Football will have to ban across the country...
Recognition of the National Security Agency reinforce paranoia corporations against state surveillance
Term day in late August, the German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Service for the protection of the constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence service, his assignment was to photograph the roof of the building of the United States, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV had hoped to discover the antenna observation equipment, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin.
James Clapper said, Director of National Intelligence, the United States, in September, again assured that the United States will not use the possibility of foreign intelligence "for the theft of commercial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden is a contractual employee who became razoblachitelem - began to publish its treasury of US intelligence secrets, European governments and executives are not sure whether to believe the director on the word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to the data stored in the cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoia of corporations, caused by the state's wiretapping, to new heights.
The last straw was the news that the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel auditioned, perhaps about ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe may be a target, then, of course, are potential targets and business leaders.
Snowden made obvious intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the United States and companies.
I think it is quite likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grun, president of the association BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies are convinced that the United States now represent almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July, consulting agency EY.
All of the documents uncovered by Mr. Snowden, nevertheless, still do not have evidence that the United States passed the trade secrets of foreign companies in their own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the opinion that he should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says that we must create a German Google.
I can just close your eyes and slowly open them again...
"This is not an option," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company SAP software supplier for business.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, should not have let her die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: From coal to cars and farmers.
All except the IT industry.
Yet the scope and the technical development agencies under the US espionage, became famous thanks to J. Snowden revelations, were the shock for some companies, which previously thought that the biggest risk of surveillance is China.
The big shift is happening in cloud technologies, where the leaders of European companies better realized that the data stored in the United States, are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by the trade association Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-American participants abandoned plans to use the services of the US cloud provider after the revelations of the American mining program Prism.
Jim Snabe, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: "We see that consumers are asking a question that has not occurred a year ago, namely: Where my data and whether you can ensure that they are physically remain in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders argue that the last message is just a confirmation of what they already knew: Powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and, therefore, these data should be protected at all costs.
What happens the economic espionage, is not surprising.
He always had a place.
"It was the subject of debate for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate," says Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of the chemical company BASF.
Americans spying for us on the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spies behind them, because it is in our national interest is to protect our commercial enterprises.
The leaders of corporations usually do not like to boast the retaliation that they have taken, as this may provide an advantage to the enemy.
In large companies have long been learned that take a free drive at the exhibition or leave your laptop unattended in the hotel room is at least imprudently.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of Audi, says that for many years, it is standard practice is to collect mobile phones before the board meetings, so that they could not be used as bugs.
Federal Service for the protection of the German constitution recommends that executives of companies to consider the possibility of using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign trips because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Propane mobile phones subsequently discarded.
Nevertheless, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to intrusions and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are leaders in the world market in his particular niche.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, employees and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," he warns in a report, the BfV.
The United States warned their own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
The national intelligence summary of the United States in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel in the second series of offenders who are engaged in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the Board of Directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French worst of all."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI reportedly said in an interview this month: "The service is well aware that all countries, even when they are cooperating in the fight against terrorism, spying on its allies."
Los Angeles International Airport was evacuated due to a fire in one of the terminals.

According to preliminary data, the man was shooting from a high-power rifle.

"Was the question debated during these calls, the question of development of the commercial lease policy?" Asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy Mr. privileged.
"No," replied Mr. privileged. "
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not something.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the recommendations for schools regarding allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations, which issued the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children who suffer from food allergies, is growing.
Now, one of the 20 children in the United States have a food allergy.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to provide assistance in case of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools keep stocks of adrenaline - often for injection used automatic medical syringe EpiPen - to assist with the potentially deadly anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently made changes in the regulations to allow schools to make stocks of adrenaline with fewer difficulties.
The notice also contains a list of typical symptoms, framed by children who developed an allergic reaction.
Children can say: "I feel as though something pokes into my language," "a feeling that I have the hair" or "shiplet language."
Kenyan press indignant provocative law on media
"This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: What could not prevent the destruction of the Parliament of the independence of the judiciary in the future?" He told the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group - the parent company CapitalFM, which includes one of the most respected in Kenya, independent radio stations and news site.
He said that the new judicial authority in the media "will always be partisan, because it is a continuation of the government," and the content and advertising restrictions would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and regain his deputies," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new law essentially will allow the government "to take a stranglehold of the media" and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya, "received a serious blow," and attacked the bill as a "draconian."
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security after the attack most Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping centre.
Kenyan media have aroused the wrath of the authorities, surveillance cameras recording homemade YouTube ™ epics, where troops who were sent to the scene of the attack, allegedly rob expensive shopping mall.
Related police chief David Kimayo became the challenge of two journalists and media official for questioning, although the challenge was canceled after the mass protests of the media.
Under the new law, publishing houses can be fined up to $20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists - up to one million, with an additional risk to be "excluded from the lists," that is, to get the ban on the receipt of official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property infringer, if the penalty will not be paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine enough to paralyze the work of the majority of FM radio stations."
She also said that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called "lively blogosphere" Kenya.
Politicians understand that by forcing the media silence, they can do whatever they want, with impunity.
"No one ever know," wrote journalist Nation Mutuma Matthew, described the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.
"Left to themselves, politicians will ruin the country and return us to hunt and collect," he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers were the target of public anger and in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of the cuts, appointed by the National Commission on wages, and the restoration of the size of its huge salaries averaging about 532 thousand shillings a month, tax-free, is one of the highest in the world.
Investigators check the information about the ill-treatment with a child in Biysk
On October 29, media published a message that the teacher of one of the city's kindergarten Bianca for educational purposes child locked in the basement.
Currently, investigators realized all the circumstances, and also provides a legal assessment of the actions of the employees of the kindergarten.
After the accusations of durgs Yevgeny Vasilyev spoke
Yevgeny Vasilyev, almost a year to the person that draws attention to the media, still never commented numerous publications in the press as the embezzlement in the Defense Ministry and is personally about her relationship with ex-Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and the love of valuable things.
However, on November 1 figurant affairs "Oboronservis" broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasiliev said: "Originally, of course, the task was exactly one: Pull out of me any negative information about the former Minister of Defense."
There was blackmail for what I should give testimony, otherwise I was imprisoned.
Today, these threats stopped.
Then we go to court, we will prove his innocence.
With the victory, we are confident at 100 percent.
At the same time of the interview, we can conclude that, perhaps the most Vasilyev collided words that she doesn't matter with taste.
Probably, a statement by the official representative of the RF IC Vladimir Markin that in the collection of paintings, which collect figurant affairs "Oboronservis" were fake.
Among the arrested property has a number of paintings that hostess, being confident in their deep Poznan art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the arts expert appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings, found that they do not have any artistic value and, simply put, are cheap counterfeits, "Markin said in early October.
Some paintings, stolen from the Ministry of Defence.
Then still acknowledged that they are not stolen from the Defense Ministry, said that I have a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, it's just an outrage, "says Vasiliev.
At the same time, the question of whether she admits his guilt even in one of the 12 accountable to her criminal episodes, Vasiliev said: "Certainly not.
Private nothing at all.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
Just insert the people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's announcement of the RF IC that Vasilieva shies away from exploring the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer figurant said that he and his client "investigator does not get acquainted with the case."
What caused the revelation under house arrest Vasilyeva, still not bashed with the press?
Perhaps, as a woman, she could not respond to the accusation in bad taste?
Or are right journalists "Komsomolskaya Pravda" ill repute a couple of days ago that she "sunk into a greater trance under house arrest" because of the news about reconciliation, Anatoly Serdyukov, with his wife and his return to the bosom of the family?
The famous military observer "KP" Victor Barnet in his article, "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" Wrote: "Investigators do not exclude that after such a shock, it may become more talkative on interrogations."
Earlier, Vasiliev some accusations of illegal sale of real estate took the Defense Ministry.
"Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci" does not help the team in the Italian championship match with "Parm."
According to Football Italia, the coaching staff decided not to include him in the application for the game to extra before the match of the 4th round of the Champions League Group with "Real."
Also did not take part in a duel with "Parma" Lichtsteiner, hopes milestone.
And forward Fabio Quagliarella recovered from injury and ready to play.
The British government announced about the study, directed at improving the economic benefits for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
The project involves the discovery of the HS2 high-speed communications with Scotland and the north of England, with the beginning of the First Phase of 81.
The transport minister Baroness Kramer noted that the project "will unite Britain."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was "delighted" by the prospect of working on a plan with the British government.
The first round will be to build a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When will be completed the Second Step, the line will be built in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government raised the estimated cost of the construction of the high-speed line between London and the north of England with £12.2 to £42.6 billion.
Britain's government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, mandated by the HS2 Ltd to consider further improvement of the railway capacity and reducing the length of trips to the North of England and Scotland.
This should include the ability to overcome the path from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal of HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make the UK and its cities closer to each other."
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring, are huge.
Without him, we will face a crisis of bandwidth in our rail network.
But it also comes to transport links cities with each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive the best message thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government Keith Brown urged Mr. Carmichael "unequivocally" to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed railway has all the chances to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland in a common argument for high-speed railroad across the UK."
Therefore, we are happy to work in partnership with the British government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and a continuation of the railway line, Glasgow, Edinburgh, which is already planning to Scottish government.
I'm looking forward to reviewing the results of the study with British ministers in the next year and a joint decision on the next steps.

U.S. congressmen continue to argue about how we can further reduce the government's financing.

The Japanese electronics maker, Sony Corporation, completing the past quarter with a net loss of $19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced forecast profit for the current financial year.
Sony's results for the period from July to September 2013 were more sobering than expected due to falling demand for televisions, video cameras and personal computers manufactured by Japanese corporations.
Sony's TV business, in the second quarter, the company gave the first three years, the operating profit of $5.2 billion yen in the reporting period again fell to 9.3 billion yen operating loss.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing hard times, especially due to a decline in demand for televisions.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of the main rivals Sony, Panasonic Corporation, recently shifts the emphasis on industrial components: Here, the company's sales are growing rapidly, especially at the expense of automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the financial year, which ends in March 2014, Sony expects to get 179 billion yen operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to the Thomson Reuters agency, analysts suggested that this figure will be much higher and $221 billion yen.
Seeking to get out of the crisis, Sony expands the product line.

Acer offers amounted to extremism insulting patriotic sentiment
For the legislative protection of patriotic feelings of citizens from anti-Russian provocations and insults "Fair Russia" offers to equate insulting patriotic feelings to extremist activity and punished for it five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Izvestia, such amendments to the legislation prepared spread Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheev, has already sent to see a conclusion to the Supreme Court and the government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments offers to understand the emotional connection of a man with a country, of which he is a citizen, featuring love for this country, a responsible attitude to her fate, respect for its history and culture.
As pointed out by Mikheyev, in domestic legislation, there are sanctions for violation of a formal characteristics of state power - the flag and emblem.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be injured and insult state symbols, and other forms of disrespect to our country, in the Russian legislation established enough.

On the eve of the main nationwide holiday, Victory Day on May 9 - is the real orgy of every year.
Uprating of wits and "alternative view" on the story, some publicists reach the reasoning that say how sorry that cultural Germans have not conquered the wild Soviet Union!
I think this is absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride for the story remains the main "spiritual" cement of the nation, "Oleg Mikheyev, doubts.
In addition, according to Mr Mikheev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers and offend patriotic feelings, you can almost with impunity.
According to the people's candidate, should equate insulting patriotic feelings to extremist activity and prescribe a 282-article of the Criminal Code of the appropriate punishment.

Treason - social structures that control the conditions in prisons.
The case of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhayev, unrest in cope colony - it is through treason get publicity, the majority of high-profile incidents behind bars.
The control of treason is a battle between human rights activists and lobbyists security forces.

At 1800 vacant seats claim less than a thousand people, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria contests could not organize due to a lack of candidates.
PR promises to organize donor on vacant seats.
Moscow's treason is one of the few commissions with the competition, despite the fact that the new members instead of 20 to 40 participants.
According to Borges, in the current composition of the capital's commission on human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the case, which is located on the vote in the Chamber, the ratio is changing at 17 to 23.
In the metropolitan commission wanted to get 30 human rights defenders.
But in a new composition may re-enter the representative of "Boys brotherhood," Vyacheslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the treason for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borges believes that security forces, appointing a chairman of treason, will be able to do the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so the activists do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of the siloviki coordinates U member Anton Tsvetkov, head of the "Office of Russia" - the organization of upholding the interests of the security forces.
"I don't eat babies on ­ occupied the truck," said RBC Daily Anton Tsvetkov.
He denies that argues the promotion of any lists and says that is not going to prevent defenders to attend the arrested opposition.
According to 1972, he did not even interested in what the list of now vote in the Chamber.
Barodd Borshchev information he considers a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders - planning change of leadership Chelyabinsk treason.
Her former leaders pushed aside from last year's copy unrest.
In the Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
The treason of Rostov-on-Don can pass from human rights defenders to the uniformed services.
Of the new lists of the "disappeared" human rights activist and chairman of the local committee, but was one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013, the federal Public Chamber disqualified him for unethical behavior.
Lists of Moscow and Rostov commissions Borges believes "revenge for Cope."
Probation Hope Tolokonnikova has not affected the treason of Mordovia, which considered the "power": A new members wanted to get only one human rights activist, and she doesn't even have taken the documents for the contest.
A member of the Chamber, Nikolai Svanidze, told RBC Daily, which voted against the proposed list because he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.

I think that this case will not be limited.
However, the authorities in the next two years, does not plan to take any programs in support of regional enterprises that are in a difficult position, "he explained, adding that when making a budget, the government does not consider stagnation of production in the region and a great job cuts.
In "Forde" this information does not refute and does not confirm.

NSA blames "an internal error" and not the hackers in the termination of the site
Octane secret National Security Agency announced on Friday night that the cessation of their site for several hours, caused a technical failure, not hackers, as stated in the network.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to the internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," Intelligence Agency reported in the official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Statements that flows into the work was caused by the distributed attack like "denial of service" (DDoS] are wrong.
Earlier tonight online monitoring system registered the servers that NSA website has not worked for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable for some users.
Earlier, the representative of the NSA, told ABC News that the internal secret network of the agency "does not" was hacked.
No secrecy information is not in danger, the official said.
At least one online group of hackers and activists said that it is responsible for the withdrawal of the NSA website using DDoS-attacks.
DDoS attacks are designed to explode in the target site traffic until the servers are not overwhelmed and the site does not go down.
Tactics hackers are relatively simple, but the attacks are not intended to infiltrate into the internal network of the target system.
Earlier, the NSA supersecret, once received the nickname "No Agency there," turned out in recent months at the center of public attention and fierce criticism after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and within the country - all this reaction to NSA secret files, stolen from the agency and published disappointed by former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has provoked reflections about the fact that today's incident was the result of a determined action of hackers.
Gazprom chief Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, Gazprom said.
"Today was a significant milestone: Began construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, a very large and important project in Europe," said Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
"South Stream is meant to diversify export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, where there is a large part of the Russian gas intended for Europe, raises the level of risk for regular routes, officials say.
Miller said that a direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries, eliminated "forever."
The Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the "South Stream" at a discounted price, as in 2015, the whole project will begin to work.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries located on the route of the pipeline, by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
The agency "Rosbalt" denied the status of the media for нецензурні лайки
Court on October 31 decided to void the license of the registration agency Rosbalt, "writes" Tape. "
The deprivation of the status of the media insisted ABTA - for the systematic and gross violations of the law on the media.
During the process was created by a bad precedent: The court considered it possible to close the media, effectively denying the right to rebut.
What is "Rosbalt."
"Information agency Rosbalt" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the agency has opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
Also, the agency has offices in the countries of the former Soviet Union.
Since 2001, "Rosbalt" evolved and functioned as a federal information-analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s agency included in the list of the most recognizable private online media in Russia.
The Los Angeles Times has always held a very specific niche: The nucleus of exclusive agency publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement bodies.
Talk about the next edition to the security forces continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Along with the fact that "Rosbalt" had a broad base of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions talked and what led the project was Natalia Chaplin's wife, Viktor Cherkesov.
This Chaplin role in leadership "Rosbalt" until the end is not clear: It is often referred to as "the head of the project."
Director General of the agency is Larisa Afonin, editor-in-chief, Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, "Rosbalt" is not involved in the ratings of federal media - neither the quote, nor in the audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the rating of the attendance of Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, Bytva ukrajinskyh mist audience Rosbalt.ru site is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials for the past five months - notes about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the band's lead singer's death, the "King and jester" pogroms in metropolitan Biryulevo.
The conflict "Rosbalt" with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when entered into force amendments to the law on the media, banned journalists нецензурні лайки.
But found the forbidden vocabulary in two published on the website of the agency videos ("digit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot oskvernili oil rigs").
The further describe in different ways.
ABTA discovered the video accused "Rosbalt" for the gross and systematic violation of the law on the media and turned to the courts to take over the agency license.
In "Rosbalt" stated that the agency claims bogus: First, the videos were not redaction materials, secondly, the meeting, the words were masked in them, and, in the third, immediately after the warning videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roscomnadzor claims in the world court - and when the October 22, 2013 Roscomnadzor Court has accepted the lawsuit, consider these complaints have continued.
However, the world number 25, the judge decided not to favor "Rosbalt": Editor Nicholas Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 rubles - about 10 thousand for each clip.
Obviously, this predecide and the outcome of the hearing in Khodorkovsy - if to abandon the idea that the outcome could be decided even earlier.
October 31, the court decided to recognize the invalid certificate of registration "Rosbalt," effectively blocking the agency status of the media.
This is not to say that "Rosbalt" during the standoff remained alone.
The agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (a statement in the name of Roscomnadzor head Alexander Jaroff on October 10 signed the 26 deputies; the document was filed on the initiative of the Communist Party).
About the closure of the magazine stated that the head of Russia's Journalists Union Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and head of the Presidential Council on Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roscomnadzor even gave him any guarantees that the license revocation to deal would not go.
The trial of "Rosbalt" showed: Under whose jurisdiction safer to be means of mass media in Russia today is a big question.
A gene speech was a stimulant education synapses
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School discovered protein, thanks to which the gene "speech" Foxp2 carries out its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study published in Science, on the site of the magazine, you can read his summary.
Foxp2 gene is the first known genome, the function of which is directly linked to the speech.
Establish his role was in 2001, thanks to the discovery of the family of several people who could not properly pronounce the words and sometimes even do not understand each other.
Scientists found that the family members had been breached by the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function, was not known.
In the new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their functions of the Foxp2 serves as a stimulator of new synapses in the area of the brain associated with the formation of speech.
Is he thanks to another genu, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for the factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes found by the authors, while only on his activity set Foxp2.
What SRPX2 really affects vocalization, scientists have confirmed in the experiment on mats.
When the animals, the activity of the gene was artificially lowered, they are less shouted when sharing with her mother.
If the activity of the gene rebuilt, was recovering and frequency of published sounds.
Earlier, the mice also was shown a link with vocalization Foxp2 itself.
The animals, which injected human copy of the gene, the sabres more active and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know that the work of the Foxp2 and, accordingly, managed SRPX2 them with purely "mechanical" properties of education sounds or thinner processes.
Ponomarev left the "Fair and Just Russia."
A deputy of the State Duma of the party A Just Russia, a member of its office in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev filed a statement to withdraw from the political organization.
As the MP said in a statement he filed in the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.

Want to luminous in the dark ice cream?
The British entrepreneur has created the world's first glowing in the dark ice cream with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop a radiant food.
He came to this idea after reading an article about Medusa, and convinced the scientists in China chemically reproduce the glowing protein.
Ice-cream comes in response to the language of who eats it, increasing the pH level in the eye and causing it to glow.
Chris says that because the ice cream begins to glow when responding to the warmth of the mouth, it means that the more you light, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the company for the production of ice cream "line me, I'm a tasty," says: "It is an incredible thing, but still at the initial stage of production, however, for £200, you will get about 2 grams of the substance."
Protein that we use in ice cream, comes in response to your language in a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warm protein, it will raise the pH level and ice cream begins to glow.
We tested him over the last few months, and it seemed that the ideal would be to introduce him to the Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is perhaps the most expensive ice cream from those that I did, because the jellyfish luminescence at four times the price of gold.
So every ball cost me around £140.
But it is quite pleasant to taste.
Pilot Charlie Company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and taste of mosaic gold.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said: "I very much want to develop invisible ice cream."
It is, by definition, impossible due to radiation caused by ice crystals, of which is ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice-cream uses fluorescent jellyfish properties, synthesized Chinese scientists

The EU is preparing Ukraine's support measures in case of economic pressure.

Do not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to get the aid, and the international rating agency S & P, ponite on Friday, Ukraine's sovereign rating one notch to "B-" from "B".
However, EU officials say that IMF may show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.

The Italian workers with experience give way to the young
The Italian unemployment hitting record.
Published on Wednesday, the data showed that without work now 12.5% of the country's residents.
So bad things are not fewest since the Second World War.
Among the young, this figure is higher in several times.
40.4% of residents aged 15 to 24 years, do not have employment.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
This way is already the largest energy company in the country, and adopted laws allow the regional authorities to provide part of any pensions for workers with the experience.
However, on the other hand, Italy faces a common for Europe, the problem of an aging population.
And economists do not believe that the affair with premature file rotation of personnel will redeem themselves.
Syria destroyed the equipment for chemical weapons
Syria destroyed all announced capacity for the production of chemical weapons, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This is the first phase of the disarmament Damascus has completed the day before the deadline.
Until November 1, Syria would destroy the production and other auxiliary facilities designed for the preparation of warfare agents to the application, the BBC reports.
The destruction of the stocks of toxic agents or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, currently toxic substances are found in sealed vaults.
International inspectors went to Syria after on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 during the chemical attacks were killed, according to the United States, more than 1,400 people.
The main task of the inspectors was not to lose time - not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more chemical weapons - and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and equipment of ammunition.
For these production facilities will now watch carefully to prevent their repairs.
The next milestone is a mid-November: This time the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
The questions here a lot.
Where they will be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All of the Syrian statements will be carefully checked by western razvedslujbami.
They readily advise inspectors new objects to test, if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus was not fully candid.
The United States believed that this fire was held regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that it is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community has demanded from the Syrian leadership, according to the agreement reached under the mediation of Russia, is to destroy or lead to inoperable all facilities for the production of shells, toxic gases and liquids and ammunition to fill these substances.
Now, when this stage passed, the next step should be the elimination of existing chemical weapons from the Syrian army.
It is expected that this arsenal may be more than 1,000 tons of nerve paralytic toxic substances, skin-nerve mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored at dozens of different places.
For its destruction is necessary to OPCW and the Syrian authorities agreed to start a schedule of action - it is given two weeks.
The head of field operations of the OPCW Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "personally watched the destruction of the equipment."
"They now there is no possibility to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapons," he said.
In a statement, the OPCW said that inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and made sure that plants for the production of shells and toxic substances either destroyed or are in disrepair.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to conduct inspections there, according to the document, but the equipment was transported from there and verified by the OPCW.
According to Smith, the process of destruction of infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was "particularly post" because I had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, a time to celebrate the inspectors have so far not found - they were too busy with work.
George Kerevan: The gap with Europe gives Scots choice
Another day, another strashilka about independence.
This time, we warn that an independent Scotland would join the European area of free movement as a condition of membership in the EU.
State turn stories about the passport control at Berwick and border with barbed wire along the shaft Adrionova.
However, Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the potential economic benefits of freer movements in the rest of Europe, although it is predictable - it's not appeared in headlines.
No one has also pointed out that EU member countries spend a lot of time to turn their formal rules as it is convenient for them.
Because Scotland is not included in the Schengen area continued non-compliance requirements will be a cheap concession for Brussels in return what he really wanted from the Scots.
So it's not interesting story.
And so old that it has turned into a fossil: The first time I heard "duck" that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting moment, lost in the paraphrase of ancient tales.
Why did an independent Scotland must execute orders in Europe?
Why change the yoke of London on the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is a real European news: The great postwar plan to unite Europe finally has stalled.
The eurocrisis project "Europe" is officially dead.
Across the European Union parties opposed the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a common currency, gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany "- based only this year - appeared out of nowhere and has received almost five million votes in the September federal election, thus essentially replacing the" Free Democrats "(the equivalent of our" Liberal Democrats ") from the Bundestag.
There was always the internal opposition to the plan of a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
Austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the chains imposed on the national economy through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to believe that the project "Europe" gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits, "it was true only for Greece.
Actually system blocked its members on exchange rates, favorable for German exporters, "that German politicians and want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in pre-production capability disadvantage in comparison with Germany.
The only means of salvation is to cut wages and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
In the current budget problems and the currency is a deeper problem of the productive capacity of Europe.
As a result of measures to "green" energy introduced Brussels, is a cipher for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, "the European industry is paying twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.
This paralyze adverse price terms, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
No freezing salaries in the world does not stop the overwhelming victory of cheap US shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, the revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the most ardent that she was a EU.
After the war, the French political elite is viewed by the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a level with Washington.
But Berlin is no longer needed in Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy, Europe, leaving the ruined economy of France in distress.
The result is a right-wing, anti-EU party serving Marine Le Pen's National Front "has just won a decisive election, throwing the ruling Socialist party into third place.
"The Front" is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labor that cannot proceed from the assumption that the rift among the right would automatically in favor of the left.
What makes Le Pen with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the elections to the EU in the next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If - and this is very likely - against pro-EU parties will receive support in this election, such a bloc will first take a dominant position in the European Parliament.
That's my opinion: Soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are fused together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but he again will become something of a vague "Europe (sovereign) nations" who liked General de Gaulle.
Germany and several dependent on her economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe to restore their own currencies.
I suppose that Britain refrains from this project, hoping to move closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific points to the likelihood that Britain will remain unaddressed in the cold Atlantic.
In what position it leaves Scotland?
We can choose to become the region (in fact) Little England.
Or we can protect their own economic interests, which means, among other things, send Berlin and Brussels to throw.
I suspect that Scotland could succeed in the framework of freer European agreement provided that we will keep its currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier to federal Europe nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of Norway and the preservation of our economic independence.
The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is - oddly enough - the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures that have provoked a formidable majority in 2011 due to objections against the spending cuts proposed (and implemented) Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Aleister Darling and subsequently seduced by the coalition of the Tories and the Liberal Democrats.
Scotland now it would be ridiculous to vote for independence, only to accept the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.

Bamford filed an appeal of his sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, at this time, she spends his holidays in Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Those in Thailand, legal sources said that Bamford currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could lead to the fact that the court will increase its verdict for up to two years and will force it to serve time in prison for adults.
However, after the recent killing of Australian agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its dissipated tourist image that will lead to an acquittal constituted rendering.

Early puberty: Aging earlier
African and Latin American girls usually reach puberty earlier than their white survey, the research shows.
The physical changes do not mean that puberty close
There is no evidence that blame hormones or other chemicals
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the launch mechanisms of early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is not as expressed in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should the mother frightened if her daughter are beginning to form the beginnings of breast cancer and pubic hairs to grow at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, a pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time, calming parents - usually does not mean the rapid onset of puberty," said Kaplowitz.
Evident signs of development, such as growing breasts, love and muscle hair and body odor, appear before the girls.
But it was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and declined compared with 12,75 in 1970.
"After the chest begins to develop, is at least two to three years before the march," said Kaplowitz, also is the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: How to deal with this widespread problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will prosper.
The debate about what constitutes an actual onset of puberty, but is considered "premature" when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in the growth of up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow or fizzle is what the pediatrician can monitor carefully.
A more rapid progression can serve as a basis for tests at endocrinologist to exclude the serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.
There are procedures to detain the early menstruation and prevent another consequence: Premature aging bones, which ultimately could lead to slower growth and lower growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz cautious with drugs, but admits that "the suppression of puberty may soften behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from their peers."
Another big problem is clear: Parents simply do not want to do their very young daughters were menstruation.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or even about how they cope with health issues," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman, the daughter of menstruation which began in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school fearful and upset by the fact that she was the first among his friends.
There are a lot of muchheralded theories about the causes of early puberty.
Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual statements in the media.
The boys - like girls, puberty comes earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the premise, which has the greatest weight, is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years old, which connects the amount of fat in the body with the terms of puberty.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country of African-American and Latin American girls usually reach puberty earlier than their white survey.
There are various explanations.
Around the world in the early puberty apparently affects everything from economic conditions and change to the genes.
Another mystery: Although the boys pubic hair on the face and to appear at younger ages, the tendency to complete early sexual maturation is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors involved in the conference, AAP, confirmed the complexity of this theme.
The emergence of pimples and pubic hair found even in infants and a toddler.
"We must be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children's Hospital in Goryeb Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from the pediatrician about how to talk with their child.
"It may mean an earlier than expected, the conversation," explained Kaplowitz.
If you keep calm, your child usually respond well.
Devices that bloom early, you need to confirm that even when it happens early, this process is a normal part of life.

RBS shuts two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland, suspended from the work of the two traders in his subdivision on currency transactions, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is another proof that global regulators check alleged manipulation in the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world's largest financial market, the daily turnover of which is $5.3 trillion.
These two trader will be the first by the RBS, suspended during the unfolding investigation, which dovetails with scandal involving manipulation of the interbank rate LIBOR.
Case comment on suspension, the bank confirmed that this month he had received requests for information from regulators.
"Our current investigation of this issue continues, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators," he said at the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the knowledgeable person said that RBS gave the records of e-mail and instant messages, which received and sent his former trader, Britain's regulatory authority - the Office for control of financial activities (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, resigned from RBS in 2010 and, as far as we know, he was given a vacation at his current post as head of the European spot of currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was removed from the Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders have not been accused of any violations.
The group IM contacts Mr. Asher included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to knowledgeable individuals.
The bank UBS announced this week that he has taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator FINMA said that he was investigating alleged manipulation in the currency market in several Swiss banks.
At least six regulatory bodies in the world - the European Commission, FINMA, the Swiss agency Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice, the US and Hong Kong value management is considering allegations that bankers are engaged in a conspiracy to impact on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal audits or have received requests for information from regulators, said a person familiar with the situation.
Banks through instant messages and e-mails for several years in search of cases of offences.
News about the checks roused the traders in the sphere of activities that were in recent years, one of the largest sources of income trading divisions of the investment banks, which this year, however, faced difficulties because low currency volatility reduces the opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation, saying that the extensive and liquid currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that it is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge amount of daily trades in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use of the bank's internal platforms means that "you can begin to exert influence on the market for a very small price."
This news came on the same day, when the bank Credit Suisse announced that fired one of the traders of the stock trading department of the London Stock Exchange this week, after he caused losses amounting to almost 6 million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank immediately informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with regulators.
"We are confident that a trader acted alone and that the issue was able to localize," said Credit Suisse.

John Kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that the US espionage "debate went far."
John Kerry demonstrated the mitigation of the tactics of the protection of the U.S. surveillance programs, making an unprecedented recognition that in some cases, the US espionage "debate gone far."
The secretary also acknowledged that the guilty, along with Barack Obama, that was "on autopilot" during the high-profile appearance of Edward J. Snowden revelations about NSA spying activities.
These leaks of information put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video link on the open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government actually took some things happening on autopilot, because such a possibility already existed - and during the Second World War, and in a very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, on September 11."
Then he became the first senior member of the U.S. government to recognize that the US espionage went too far, but stressed that affect the rights were not violated.
He said: "In some cases, it debate went far.
And the president is determined to shed light on the issue and communicate to the people, and now holds a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has the feeling of abuse.
I assure you, abuse of innocent people in this process is not present. "
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted out of good intentions and that its tracking operation saved many lives.
He added: "We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow himself.
In the world there is a radical extremism, reckless and full determination to kill people, blow people and attack on the government.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?

In other Snowden probations were released documents showing that the NSA continued monitoring of the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as phones about 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended the spy activities against allies as necessary and said that it is a normal thing on both sides.
Amid the hype Murphy said that his office is organizing a trip of members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still at the stage of development.
While Murphy said that the purpose of the trip is to promote the improvement of relations, he said that some degree of hardness, "meaning" will also be manifested.
He said that European leaders must be honest with his people in which spyware programs they have used for many years.
"While we can change our tracking program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only ones who engaged in intelligence activities," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry should go this weekend in the Middle East and to Poland to solve the problems of hostility toward the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence activity.

We were allowed to eat candy with his sister, the late does not lie down and organize masquerade for our region.
Now I am more pokoju on crag.
I was called in the last two years, handing out candy in his apartment and will likely not begin this year.
However, the statistics show that I am white ravens on Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, a majority of Americans - namely 158 million - will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations.
The only thing that I am looking for every Halloween, is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the suits will take $1.2 billion from spent $6.9 billion.
This year, at the height of fashion sexual inanimate objects.
Women are no longer necessarily be members of the sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, or marks McMuffins.
As for the men, I think we will see a lot of zombies thanks to "shade marts', and I am sure that the astronauts in the style of the band Daft Punk get into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the suits, which are seeking more often, is a zombie, Batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps, there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We nargile our dogs last year, and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend this year of $330 million on costumes for pets.
That means a lot of funny dogs and hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we are not smelling.
Americans spend on them $1.9 billion this year, according to the Nielsen Company.
It is about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate bars, inc, chocolates Milk Duds, chew Twizzlers candy bars and Clark Bar.
According to the Ministry of Trade of the United States, it is excellent news for 41 million demanding candy children who are prepared to win our areas.
Moreover, we'll buy and is not going to deceive ourselves - eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing that we do not want to eat, is a candy in the form of corn kernels; and yet, according to the National Association of confectioners, nearly 35 million pounds of them sold under the Halloween.
It is about 9 billion of individual tiny corn.
It is a mystery that I have yet to discern.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween, as the haunted house.
They have tremendous names, such as "Horror behind the walls" (which, incidentally, is in a real jail), "Howl and cry" and "House of the shock."
Moreover, according to the Society of America Haunts, in America, there are 1,200 officially recognized the haunted houses, generating about $500 million of income, as well as those amazing photos, where you're almost piss that your friend posted on Facebook, but you can't remove, and then the guy that you like, sees the photo and leave a comment like "cool expression."
And finally talk about take.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great tics when we were children, and Jack resin lamp is like a Christmas tree decoration, what we are doing with childhood.
Fortunately for us, the fashion for a child in take began only last year, thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown by clipping the pumpkin, rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year, Americans will spend about $106 million on the pumpkin.
The lamp is Jack, slowly drying on your porch, probably came from the state of Illinois, who raised this year 542 million pounds of pumpkin.
If you want to work harder, visit Tim and Susan Mattison in Napa California and try to cut something out of their pumpkin weighing in 2032 lbs.

The owners of pawnshops in Singapore is doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
In Bendemeer draws in a shopping center in Singapore Janani Amirthalinga lays a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for the schooling of his daughter.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so that all my money is invested there," says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she and earns S $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia - where the volume of household debt is growing - is that ValueMax, where she conducts its deal, this week became the third Lombard registered on the Stock Exchange of Singapore.
Credit on bail jewelry is not just a quick way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Usually, pawnbrokers in Singapore, there are an effective annual interest rate of 17% - just above the 15.4% offered in the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a subsidiary in the same shopping center.
However, the pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or evidence of wages and can lend faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers, because families are feeling the pressure because of the rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth that followed the global financial crisis, and cheap loans, pitated loose monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and middle-income countries are turning to pawnbrokers to offset the decline in revenues as the slow growth of their economies.
This week, the Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, has indicated an increase in household leverage, mainly due to the growth of mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, compared with 60% in 2008.
Economists is also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely got out of technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with the rise in prices, people in the middle and bottom of the income scale [] will look for ways to supplement their incomes where only able to," said Song Seng wun, CIMB economist, a Malaysian bank.
Record high gold prices in the past two years, exacerbated the haste with which people are pawning their personal belongings, because they are using the opportunity to get money for their family jewels.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items contained in 200 Lombard points, the city-state, are gold products.
People say: "The price of gold looks good, let's lay a gold chain of grandmothers and get it back in the next month."
In Thailand, the largest operator of pawn shops EasyMoney observed an increase in the number of customers using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
Growth in Lombard business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the department in Bandera and 15 others, such as in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where he has four stores, but also outside Asia, too, says Jean Lee Ching, executive director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion, with 60 percent of the S $66 million raised this week as a result of the placement of shares on the Stock Exchange of Singapore.
While some lenders have caused the fire of criticism because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeoh says that a stigma not only offers cheaper rates than other creditors, he also does not increase the debt directly.
"Clients are pawning items that they already possess, and monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households," she says.
Clad becoming increasingly widespread public recognition as a means to get the short-term, secured financing.
And while Lombardi are not only those categories of people who are in dire financial straits.
Rich people in Singapore also use the offices of ValueMax, laying the gold bars or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short period for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses, which need to overcome temporary financial difficulties," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.
Bashkiria may reflect the grain on the auction until the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria during public procurement interventions may reflect the grain on the auction until early 2014, believes the republic's Agriculture Minister Nikolay Kovalenko.
Today, the market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales in intervention fund.
While the market price is higher, and there is demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be put up for auction, after the New Year," he said at a press conference yesterday.
The minister recalled that in this year's crop of agricultural crops under the harvest of 2013 totaled 3.1 million hectares, including grain area - 1.7 million hectares, up 3.3% more than last year.

Employees of the South-Eastern DR-Russia's Interior Ministry is checked.
Ashes question about the criminal case, said a senior official of the information and public relations of the South-Eastern DR-Russia's Interior Ministry of transport Sergei Olchovik.
Russian siloviki knows nothing about the group "Community of the circle of Novye Izvestia."
This reach writes with reference to the informed source in the Russian law enforcement agencies.
"After the reports appeared in the media about the making of the US Treasury Department Leps in control lists on suspicion of belonging to a criminal syndicate Eurasian 'Community' circle, we looked at all the databases, but such groups are not found," said the agency's interlocutor.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously wrote "OR" yesterday, the US Treasury published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal gang "Community of the circle."
Among them was named and the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears in the list as "Grisha," posted the day before.
The data of the popular Russian singer they coincide.
Specifies the exact name - Gregory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
Besides the Leps, there mentioned another five people.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another member of the former Soviet Union, whose nationality was not specified.
In the United States are sure that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket transported for bandits money on their behalf.
By this message accompanied by a photograph of the singer and include all its data, which correspond to reality.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The agency noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
Engine man in black lists of American Finance entails blocking its assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with people living in the United States.
Potica Serikova Mayan Leps said that no notifications to the singer were reported: "It is difficult to answer the question that whether it is Gregory, about which everyone is talking now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All that knows Leps is information to the media.
Officially to him personally, there was no notifications, although did not know whether they are in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other is surprising and unexpected," she told RIA Novosti.
She said that on Phuket Grigory Leps does not live, but, as the U.S. Treasury argues, the house on the Thai island he really is.
She said that Leps now is a long tour to the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him on the flight to the city of Blagoveschensk.
A black box you in the car?
While the American road designers are trying to find the money for the repair of highways dispages system, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box, neatly restroom on the dashboard of your car.
These devices, tracking every proezjaemuu automobilist mile and transmit this information to officials, are located in the center of the controversial attempts to modernize an outdated system of financing America's highways, undertaken routine bodies of Washington and Oregon.
Usually the boring arena of planning highways suddenly has generated intense debate and rich alliances.
Libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying the government for the right to use compact drawers to track the number of miles you proezjaemyh and even, perhaps, where you pass them, "and then use this information in tax bills.
The movement of tea in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about the private life.
And although until Congress cannot agree to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They ponder how during the next decade, you can go to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of road, which they can ride.
Thousands of motorists have already taken for testing of these black boxes, some of which have the function of satellite tracking.
It is really necessary for our country.
"This is not a question that we may be the right choice," said Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is preparing plans for the beginning of the state authorities tracking miles, proezjaemyh every Californian automobilist, by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
The technologies for this already.
The necessity of this is exacerbated by the lack of funds from the Governing Foundation for the construction of highways, funded by taxes that Americans pay at the petrol stations.
The Americans already not buy as much gasoline as before.
Cars travelling more miles per gallon.
The federal tax is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not appreciated for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even for one penny at high prices for gasoline.
"Tax on gasoline is simply impossible to save," said Li Mann, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state of the cars was recently installed on 500 tracking devices for testing poll payment system.
"It would be the best option in the long term," he said.
And call it pile user fee.
It is no wonder that this idea attracts urban liberals, because using taxes will change the nature of the trips to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Routine bodies in California look at this system during the development of strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of this state to fight global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Shuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House transportation committee, said that he, too, sees this system as the most viable long-term alternatives.
Proponents free market to fund "Reason" also delighted from what will force drivers to pay for each mile.
"It's not just a tax that will go into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of Political Affairs Reason.
People directly pay for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former ministers of transport in the United States, which in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction of poll payment.
The US Senate approved a pilot project last year worth 90 million dollars, which would be attended by about 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of fears of rural lawmakers representing the voters who in everyday life often have to come a lot of miles to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, nevertheless, are on the way.
The greatest enthusiasm is manifested in Oregon, where for participation in the largest experiment in the country claimed 5,000 drivers.
These drivers will soon be paying state for the mile run instead of tax on gasoline.
In Nevada pilot project has already been completed.
In New York, he is.
Illinois probe it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
A coalition of I-95, which includes transportation departments of 17 East Coast states, including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), examines how they will be able to carry out these changes.
This concept has not received universal recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government can track their every step.
"Concerns about the" big brother "and similar things is a big problem," said Allauddin Khan, head of the issues of strategy and management at the Department of Transport Nevada.
It was not what people wanted.
When the tests were underway, a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its Web site: "It will be difficult to turn these devices into a full-fledged tracking devices."
There is no need to create a huge, huge technological infrastructure that will inevitably grow to store records about everyday movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the few states where difficult search for inexpensive technology that would have allowed the state authorities to allow proezjaemyh car miles, but without the information about the place and time.
If you can do it, said Khan, the society will feel more relaxed.
The search for this technology have led some state agencies to a young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company is not engaged in promoting to collect state taxes.
She sought to enter the growing market of automobile insurance, in which drivers are paid on the basis of mileage.
But the device, which it tests, attract designers roads because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloadable via modem.
"People will be more inclined to do it, if you do not track their speed and do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There were several big mistakes in some of these pilot programs in the state.
There is much less expensive and less hypes ways to do it.
In Oregon designers are experimenting with providing drivers of the various options.
They can choose the device with or without a GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee, based on the average number of miles that can ride all the residents of the state.
In other places, are hoping to sell the idea of a careful public, forcing the device to do more, not less.
In New York, transportation officials are keen to develop nalogooblagaugee device that will also take charge for parking enumerators, to provide "pay as going" insurance and collect data about the speed of the pool in real-time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Automobilists will involve the benefits that they will offer," says the document urban design.
Some designers transport systems, however, think about is not whether all the talk of poll paying just a huge distraction.
In the urban transport commission in the San Francisco Bay area officials say that Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy trustee of the Fund for the construction of highways, raising taxes on gasoline.
Extra-time or annual tax would charge drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline, so that they pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgical intervention, when all you have to do is to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on legislation and public relations.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about his private life and many other things.
Pope Francis named the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will raise the dignity of the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in terms of his service on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and it is they who elect popes, so Francis will appoint its first group of people who eventually will be involved in choosing his successor.
Currently, there are 201 Cardinal.
However, after reaching the Cardinal 80 years of age, he can no longer take part in the election of Pope is the prerogative of a group of 120 "Cardinals-electors."
In announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony will be held in construction of a meeting of all current cardinals, known as consistory.
"Pope Francis decided to pre-announce its decision to convene the Consistory in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of the cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from the organization of the "Catholic vote," said that by February, the number of cardinals electors are likely to recede.
He said that the pope usually refers to as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinals electors-up to 120, as well as so many cardinals over the age of 80 years as he chooses.
Consistory next year will be of great significance because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, according to Valero.
At the moment there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance," he said.
In South America, home to 40 percent of Catholics, but they are insignificant number of cardinals.
It will also be the first chosen by cardinals since the formation of the Council of Cardinals Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, which is to seek ways of reforming the church.
In the past, the pope all decided independently.
"Now, Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it was "quite possible" that Francis will turn to considers for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before - all this is the first time for us.
Valero said that dads are usually built into the office of Cardinal Bishops from large parishes, but Francis "is full of surprises - so we do not know whom he cites.

Tax for foreign property owners will lead to what London bubble bursts
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary evaluation measures on capital gains tax, but expects a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced the state tax rate of 7% for homes worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in partnership, not as individuals.
At this point, the state duty of homes in areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, who constituted 708 million pounds in the 2012 / 13 financial year, already exceeds the total amount in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Humber taken together.
Mr Cook said: "After the increase in expenses on expensive homes and the introduction of related laws against evasion is very hard to argue that the taxation of expensive properties is undervalued, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this step could lead to the fact that some foreign investors will be reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners do not want to sell it," he added.
The cost of a first-class property - the top 5-10% of the housing market at a price - in the rich south-west London belt that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose to a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a survey by Savills, prices in central London continued to demonstrate the steady growth of 5.6% year on year, but they are eclipsed actively developing "domestic market" with the spike in the south-west, in the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) of the city.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Tyumen region took place on the basis of Yalutorovsk automobile plant.
As part of the event was the presentation of a new line for the production of welded steel tubes.
As told the company's commercial director Denis Gribanov, in 2011, with the advent of the new owner held marketing research to study the market steel structures in the Tyumen region.
Vysnilos that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of units per month.
After that, the decision was made about changing the profile of the plant and the installation of equipment for their production.
Already this year, shipped more than 7 thousand tons of product.
Investment in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles-lei, "said Denis Gribanov.
In October, launched a new camp that allows to increase the range.
The plant produces a fine profile of the pipe, which is used for personal and refined agriculture, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry and large - for the construction industry.
Plane reach a production level of 50 thousand tons of production per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another kind of activity, the number of employees at the plant has not shrunk - now it is 157 people in plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of more than 50 employees.
The company is retraining of employees, and the appropriate specialists are selected from the existing.
In the future, plans to introduce a new slitting unit became the thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of products, as well as another camp, with the speed of production pipes up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company will launch tubes, which are used in the housing and utilities.
The management of the company aims to close up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in this production.
Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostroumov, referring to the heads of productions, advised to pay greater attention to the modernization of the machine-building enterprises.
It is directed and form of state support for the industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and its leasing costs.
For the current year on these goals provided $150 million, two-thirds of that amount has already been spent.
The latest commission that will examine the subsidy contracts, taking documents from the companies until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimbursed expenses on the participation of local manufacturers in international fairs.
For the next year's budget includes funds of $150 million rubles, which can be used to offset leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to participate in the fairs, 3 million - on energy efficiency programs.
Negate up to 72 million rubles in compensation funds ordered and paid the equipment, which is produced in southern Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the long run, this form of support will stop because her motive was the introduction of the mining tax compensation that oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not and subsidies are direct expenditure mandate in the region.
Given the priority of the government considers a direct support of industrial enterprises, and not the financing of oil through them.
Aid budget will be tied to the investment projects, which will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders have expressed concern in connection with the prevailing situation in relations with the oilmen.
Dot coupe on their equipment is a competitive advantage of industry in the south of the Tyumen region, and its cancellation is hard to compete on price with a median strip of Russia, where more than cheap labor.
In addition, the unclear issue with the succession of the new owner of TNK-BP, Rosneft company that does not place their orders for Tyumen enterprises.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and applications for its renewal.
Currently, the enterprise south of the region who specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector cannot build a portfolio of orders for the next year.
There remains an open question whether taxes will come from the oil produced in the Uvat District in the budget of the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.

Syria destroyed their means of production of chemical weapons, says watchdog group
Syria destroyed the basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poison gas, said on Thursday, the international watchdog group, while fierce clashes raged in the north of the country, not far from one of the objects, which are believed to store toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists said that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The statement of the United Nations to ban chemical weapons was done in one day.
On November 1 deadline set by the organization based in The Hague to Damascus destroyed or made "unworkable" all the means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms to mix chemicals with poison gas and fill them with ammunition.
Completion of what is essentially an initial stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemical substances and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
This statement was made during fierce battles on Thursday in the town of Saphira, in which, according to experts, is a facility for the production of chemical weapons, as well as the place of its storage, according to the Britain-based Syrian Centre for the protection of human rights.
A group of activists who watched the losses through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that killed 120 296 people.
Of this number, as has been said, 61 067 are civilians, including 6365 children.
From the side of the government, said the group, 29 954 people are members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 are pro-Government militants and 187 - Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas.
Also among the dead, as said in the statement, were magnetic army defector and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to UN estimates on July 25, 100,000 were killed in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure does not go ahead.
The conflict has forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought several weeks in Safire with insurgents, many of whom are linked to al-Qaida groups.
The center said on Thursday there were casualties on both sides, but not cited specific data.
The fighting underscored the danger facing the inspectors on chemical weapons, gone tight schedule of its mission to wean Syria's toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
In a statement, the OPCW, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said that her team was "now satisfied that she checked and saw swept all declared Syria critically important means of production and mixing / filling equipment."
She added that "no additional inspection activities are not currently planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors said that they have completed the first round of verification, visiting 21 of the 23 sites Damascus declared.
They have not been able to visit two places for security reasons, said the inspectors.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that both places were, according to Syria, "... and abandoned chemical weapons program items in them, have been moved to other declared places that were checked."
Could not immediately determine whether the object Safire in one of the two places that OPCW inspectors could not attend.
Syria presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved in the next month, the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I salute the courage and bravery that you all have demonstrated in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken this organization," said CEO Ahmet Uzumcu Monitoring Group, in comments published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war puts the rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with Assad's government and its security forces, which are composed of members of his Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
As for other events, the center's director Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense site in the coastal province of Syria Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
The message: Obama's election staff viewed the exclusion of Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton's candidacy in the electoral list of 2012.
This discovery is the most vivid sensation of all the expected book by Mark Galperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 campaign "doubled bets: The game has changed 2012."
The publication of The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported on Thursday night that the president's close aides held a "large-scale studies in focus groups and polls at the end of 2011," to assess whether the exclusion of Biden to help raise the declining hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to The Times political columnist Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts of high-ranking officials of the campaign staff and the White House, namely the former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to estimate what the effect will vote on the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton vice president.
Possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in Chicago election headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, the former head of Obama's campaign staff Jim Messina and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that the replacement is considered.
The book "bets doubled," argues that Daley was the initiator attempts to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationship" but eventually withdrew from this step when their data showed that adding Clinton in the electoral list does not "significantly improve the chances of Obama."
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration really considered the possibility of replacing Biden Clinton.
"I actively advocated the examination of many things, and this was one of them," he told the Daily newspaper.
You must remember that at the moment, the president was in terrible shape, so we thought: "Oh God, what can we do?"
While the Daily described the study as "the necessary checks," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper has put the representative of that election staff enough invested in a study of whether the move will bring dividends on the vote.
"The electoral campaign offices do not spend such sums of money on polls and focus groups, if they do not consider something seriously," said Martin in the AK 360.
News, however, whether Obama knew that his team studied the possibility of replacing.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley, knew whether his then-boss about possible retasked.
While the Daily and said that he does not think that the president was "aware" of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration acknowledged that "perhaps," Obama knew.
Martin added that "doubled bets" does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political sensing came to Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin, seriously whether he believes that Obama did not know about the study opportunities to exclude Biden from the electoral list.
"Maybe," said Martin.

Legislative bans forced the Russians to drink less beer
The Russian brewers bad mood.
They calculated that beer consumption in the country in the next year will remain at the same level, and it is at best.
Although the businessmen initially counted on growth.
For the current year is unfortunate for them: Sales fell by 7 percent.
About all this told the head of one of the largest beer companies in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian brewers Isaac Sheps at the 3rd Annual Conference of the Adam Smith Institute "goods FMCG in Russia," which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already declined by 18 percent, because in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in part of the production and sales of beer is the drink with a small amounts of alcohol, "said Scheps listeners.
In no country in the world, there is no such tight restrictions on the beer market, unpredictable introducing more and more illogical taboos that bones allegedly struggle with alcohol abuse.
Pivovar complained that many of the legislative prohibitions, designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse, does not have a special influence, nonetheless appear all the new initiatives.
Boiled all the beer producers hit introduced this year with a ban on selling alcohol in kiosks.
"We immediately lost 35 thousand consumers," said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, the two brewers forecast.
Optimistic - the one that said Sept: Foamy beverage sales will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall for another 2-3 percent.
To preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to go from varieties, calculated on the consumer, in the class of "premium": The beer will be less, but it will be worth more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences from falling sales with a small amount of alcohol is not in sight.
"According to my observations, the level of alcohol diseases remains roughly at the same level," said the doctor-narcologist Alexei Sitnikov.
However, increased the proportion of patients who use surrogates alcoholic drinks, as well as those who are "addicted" to the perfumes refreshing drinks like "a jaguar," while ten years ago prevailed exactly "beer" alcoholism.
Why would the construction of the TPU in Moscow
Every year the city authorities promised to arrange more shipping centers (TPU).
Until 2020, is scheduled to enter into operation 255 TPU.
What actually turns the project, our correspondent sorting.
A couple of months ago at the station "Smolensk" Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line was a construction fence.
The caption read that goes the resettlement project.
It was very strange, because next to the "Smolensk" no land transport does not stop and, therefore, you cannot change to him.
To get to the nearest bus stop on the Garden Ring, one must overcome about 130 meters, including land transition through Carmanita lane.
For now, "Smolensk" almost all over.
Ices flower stall, demolished booth for newspapers, and asphalt before entering cobblestone changed.
That is the whole hub.
Transport and self-service transfer nodes are plane and capital, "explained at the press service of the Department of Transport.
Capital TPU is not present.
And planar require the construction of parking, the withdrawal of trade objects that could hinder the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and accomplishment.
Actually, the plane TPU even do not transporters and professional blagoustroiteli overhaul of the department of the city of Moscow.
Hub is not necessarily complicated structure, "explains the director of the Institute of Economics of transport and transport policies of the Higher School of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes a roof over their heads and the scoreboard, operate about the time of arrival of transport.
Here, for example, the station "lamps" recently opened a full-fledged 12.00PM. highlight the node.
Let without canopies, but with purchasess car parks and the scoreboard, indicating when the bus will come.
But in the pursuit of a number of officials recorded at TPU everything.
Back in 2011, the city planned to build on all about all 151 node, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now the plans until 2020 are up to 255 TPU.
Of these, 150 promise to pass more this year.
Although the city has TPU development program, has not indicated any qualitative criteria, "stated Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization" City and transport. "
Accounts by the number of objects, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often deteriorates.
Criteria, according to the expert, should be two: The first is to reduce the time of the transplant, the second - convenience.
First of all, the opportunity to change the mode of transport, not going under the rain.
In Moscow, the same arrangement of the TPU sometimes goes exactly the opposite.
A clear example of the station "Achievements."
Previously, commuter buses with Yaroslavsky highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the fairgrounds.
Now their stops moved on the opposite side of the Cosmonaut Yaroslavsky on the street.
Farther from the metro, much farther from monorails, but closer to residential buildings.
Freely that residents do not want to bus station under the windows and complained in every possible instance.
With the capital TPU in Moscow somehow did not immediately bring us happiness.
The first of them began to build five years ago at the station "Planner."
The project was designed to be a model.
And, indeed, is a sample of how 12.00PM. node, dan to investors, turns into a banal shopping mall.
No, there is a person for buses, shed not to go on the subway in the rain, and three floors of the parking lots.
True, Khimkinsky trolleybus No. 202 and No. 203 in Moscow TPU places are not given fundamentally.
Their as others pushed away from the station.
But the space under the trade more left.
One only 32 clothing shop, but in general, there is almost everything - from pet products to the showroom.
Well, in fact, suddenly somebody from the bus passengers will need to buy a new car on the road?
We have to build major TPU, somehow always get a shopping mall.
Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion when part of the car parks decided to give at the market.
Now, on the third floor of the TPU "Planner" among the marked on the floor parking spaces travelling.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, Russian speech and security guards, angrily Polding on our photographer.
Reading knot finally turned into a bazaar.
The thing is that before the station "Planner" was a market, but he was demolished.
And in the prefecture traders regretted and allowed the purchasesin parking project.
All the same because of the high prices, there is always empty.
The same funny that the market is demolished to build in its place... a new TPU highlight.
Such rocks.
The Kaluzhskaya metro distance approach from the lobby to the bus station was 50 meters, "said Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of a shopping center, ostensibly TPU, the distance has risen to 170 meters.
To get on a bus, you must go through the whole mall.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, must work around him under the open sky.
However, the structure of the "Plane" and "Kaluga" will soon be showing the neck.
In mid-September gradostroitelno-Land Commission City Council approved the planning decisions for the first eight TPU capital.
Four of them will be 25-stage, not counting the two or three underground floors.
The main monster will grow at the station "Ring," there will be 418,7 thousand square meters of space.
Representatives of the Russian Railways Directorate railway stations, responsible for the construction of the subway at TPU, has already told reporters: In future etc will contain shops, hotels and apartments.
The officials argue that the parking bay Zai ­ Mut from a third to a half of the area.
Take, for example, "folk" garages.
For example, a garage for 258 machine-seats, who recently built on the street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
So, for parking at 2.6 thousand cars in the "Petrovsko-Razumovsky" will need about 80 thousand "squares."
This is less than a third of the machines that there are going to build.
Let the one-two floors will go on various persons for buses.
It remains at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.
And that, at the minute, almost two GUM.
If the capital TPU at stations and railway stations build railway workers, then the rest of the site will develop metropolitans.
They also promised that there will be a lot of "functional destination" objects, including hotels, offices and even sports halls.
By the way, in the department of property in the city of Moscow, recently told reporters that develop a draft decree, according to which investors can apply for a plot for TPU to officials directly.
Without competitions.
Therefore, they say that transportation issues for the city is a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the "Harvard" in Boston, or "Spadina" in Toronto, "says Alexander Morozov.
There the trolleys and streetcars descend underground at the level of the subway and the distance approach from the train station to the tram is only 50 metres without entering into the street.
Around no unnecessary trade.
But Moscow officials throws in the extremes.
Either we will build nothing, or too the 25 floors with offices and apartments.

Bombardier profit declines with the fall of supplies and the number of orders for planes
The Corporation Bombardier, the Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains, reported on Thursday that net profit by 15 percent under the influence of minimised number of orders and deliveries of planes in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division.
Located in the Montreal company Bombardier also has not released any data for flight testing of its new CSeries aircraft aircraft and has not provided new information about whether made ambitious plans to introduce the plane into commercial operation by next September.
After the first flight prototype aircraft held about one and a half months ago, he was still only three times, which raises questions about whether the testing stage on schedule.
The results did not meet forecasts and led to a fall in the shares of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered its estimate on Thursday with "above moves" to "moves" because of the belief that the growth of the shares is limited in the next quarter or two.
"While the decrease in the number of aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the performance of the profits of the transport department," said Derksen in the review of the stock market.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries aircraft as the continuation of the flight test program.
Nevertheless, if not in the coming months will be announced on new orders, we assume that the market will become more skeptical about the program.
The company Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will allow her to win a seat in the lower price segment of the market, where it is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype of the aircraft was introduced in March, and for the first time, made a flying in September after several months of delay.
However, the firm orders for the CSeries aircraft so far, not too much - 177 because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to check the company's statements about fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new airliner.
There are currently has 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin, was confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders at the time when the first plane will be put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is progressing according to plan.
"The test model of the plane had not stayed on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said during a conference call, adding that at the time of the aircraft were scheduled ground tests and software updates.
All manufacturers plan to test in different ways.
We decided to spend the first flight and make a break for the upgrade, so we did.
So will occur during the entire flight test program.
The second of five test samples must take a flight in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow him, as reported by the company.
Yet analysts are skeptical about the claim that the first client could begin to the exploitation of the CSeries aircraft plane through 12 months after its first flight.
The company Bombardier said that it assesses the commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight tests - though apparently and corresponds to the domestic schedule Bombardier - reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015," said Derksen.
In the third quarter, concided on September 30, Bombardier net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same - 9 cents.
Gross income fell slightly, from $4.2 percent to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer announced that he has put 45 aircraft for the quarter, less than the average for the previous year - 57.
The total number of orders dropped from 83 to 26 planes.
The portfolio of aerospace department orders totaled $32.9 billion at September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace field results consistent with our goals, but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become unpleasant factor," Beaudoin said.
Gross income on cosmic direction fell by 13 percent - up to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest producer of trains, reported that gross income in this sector grew by almost 11 percent, to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport division totaled $32.6 billion at September 30, which is a little higher than on December 31.
In the transport division revenues negatively affected the problems with the execution of several large contracts.
Management said that in the fourth quarter will be presented a new development plan.
Shares of the company Bombardier, which also announced that Google's chief financial officer, Patrick Pichette enters the Board of Directors, fell by 8.5 percent to C $4,83 at auction in mid-Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft maker and the nearest rival, Bombardier, reported on Thursday to reduce its quarterly income by 10 percent.

Leading executive director Philip Hair asked about one case when the YMCA worker was charged with crimes related to child pornography, and about another case, when the gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sex crimes against children under his supervision, in 1991.
Mr. Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer, the commission aid provider that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.
He admitted that the YMCA in opening remarks to the commission also made a mistake, arguing that "there were external verification of the YMCA, pressed that YMCA is at the forefront to ensure the safety of children."
The Commission, the evidence suggests that YMCA was notified that she received the second-lowest of the four possible ratings on the results of the audit quality, performed by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21 years, admitted that he and nijestoyaschee leadership made a fault-Lord, and also failed to provide a clear understanding of the staff of its obligations regarding reports of violations of children's security policy.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sex crimes against 12 boys within two years of his work at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hair rejected the suggestion that the corporate ethics YMCA prevented the employees to report violations of the Lord in the safety of children.
The employees testified that they saw violations, including what the Lord was alone with children, personally courting them, throw them on your knees, said that he likes to one of them and allowed them to play their mobile phone.
Daniel Ockwell, which was under the leadership of the Lord and asked to teach its protection of children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that he found Jackie Barnett, manager of children of the branch of the YMCA in Caringbah, who was the head of the Lord, "a very frightening and often inaccessible."
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the explanation of the employees that they were embarrassed to report the situation to its senior management.
Rather, he said, their friendship with Lord him them from the thought of having to tell about it.
Mr. Hare said that he presented to the Board of the YMCA New South Wales his opinion that the lesson for the organization of the "incident with Jonathan Lord," not "concerns the provision of information" on the part of employees, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign a confidentiality agreement shortly after the emergence of the accusations was made by the Director General of the YMCA of children getting Wheatley.
He said that it was intended to prevent the damage of evidence, but "reinserted" and this decision poorly implemented.
YMCA of the New South Wales was not safe for children of the organization during the work of Jonathan Lord in the period 2009-2011, the commission said the expert on the problems of abused children, Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University.
He said that there were "serious problems" during the recruitment, selection, instructing, personnel training and control for him.
The hearing postponed until December 20.
