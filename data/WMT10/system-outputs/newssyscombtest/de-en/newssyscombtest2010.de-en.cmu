United States : a repetition is the mother of the wisdom of
It is almost comical with Barack Obama , the president , with his reputation of the brightest and best , the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan-Frage , he even for the most stupid .
When he finally made his eagerly awaited Afghanistan-Doktrin ausschwitzte , it was that he made on the Kopierpapier from three years ago .
Not only is it in the text itself , the saying goes , " as in Iraq " , he has even the name of the Bush - declaration of January 2007 as the name of its own declaration : " New Vorwärtsweg ' is used , without hesitation .
In doing so , he has even three years ago , the Bush-Idee - fresh from the civil war in the troubled Iraq - as " irresponsible and in its conclusions karastrophische decision ' .
The subsequent months have shown , however , that the recommendations of the military , came to the only possible and insofar as very successful was that in today's news about Iraq no longer .
The reputation of Bush's was not improved , because an objective he has his successor a much dankbarere hintergelassen starting position than it was to be expected .
In Afghanistan , President Barack Obama hopes that the miracle of repeatedly .
In order to increase the contingent charged with him once again asked the military , particularly the General Stanley McCristal , even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten zaudernden to protect the hard in the White House .
He called for 40,000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better .
The president postponed for three months , but it is no better idea and he has the general wenistens about 10,000 soldiers .
From Europe , he has the commitment for further 5,000 gepresst , even if he originally of at least 10,000 .
highly problematic about the whole Obama-Strategie is his plan for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in 18 months , and this process within three years . the whole Obama-Doktrin leaves more questions than answers .
There are those who doubt that the increase in the same effect as the measure in Iraq .
Also in spite of recent years is the relatively well structured , its leaders pay homage to the values .
The Afghan situation is marked by the Kontraindikation - no one can rely on and there will be no agreements .
Under these conditions , it is difficult for the Afghan security forces , which are accustomed to every day to change their mind .
The political institutions , even if it formally correct , made up only Scheinbauten , behind which the patriarchal Stammbeziehungen drags on .
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated , particularly because of the confusion of the conditions in which the Pakistan - and even more complex .
This is also to build a " heads of state , " which is the minimalist , the aim of the operation is a very unrealistic .
In any case , the Obama-Strategie surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years , the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated and now it is on the brink of explosion .
They believe that the small soldiers in the Kriegsgeschrei on the ' war ' has broken out here , to create a miracle , can only be a truly romantic soul , which is different from the facts do not impress .
From the political point of view , it is the sheer irresponsibility for the troop withdrawal , because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat .
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans , to adapt to the fray in Afghanistan to participate in running out .
Europe's politicians can and want their voters does not explain in what way the security of Germany or Italy , with the war in Iraq .
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically is the development of the events in Iran .
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increasing sanctions on the Iranians not to work , for the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem is not with troops to resolve .
That is the question that must be answered during the period in which America after Obama on Siegerabzug from Afghanistan .
Any solution will , however , also be a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation .
The only pays lip service to Barack Obama is the fact that we still have three years until the presidential election , and , therefore , there is still enough time , so that it becomes a different strategy which can themselves as Totalausfall .

President Vaclav Klaus on Friday morning , the finance minister , Eduard Janota , will remain in the government , because it is in keeping with the implementation of the programme for the next year , in the form in which it by the assembly on Wednesday , was not released .
It is thought that the budget , and perhaps also the active employment of the cabinet in the themes of Freitagstreffens .

The government has the proposals in the social democracy that is that they have hidden the budget deficit .
between the left party , on the one hand , and the government , Klaus and , on the other hand , is a severe domestic political dispute , the question marks on the further work of the Fischer-Beamtenkabinetts , on whose design of the ODS and CSSD , the Green Party in the spring .
Critics claim that the budget , such as it is , was approved by the parliament , but the package of austerity measures virtually wiped out by the fishermen - government in the autumn , and according to their understanding of the public debt .
Klaus , the law on the Staatsbudget can sign it , but not to be declared today with the entrepreneurs that the politicians to the " serious problem " that " the unsustainable deficit " of the public finances , a longer period of time have neglected .
In his opinion , there is no good solution .
An improvement could only a strong government , who is still on a broader consensus among the political parties .
The ODS-Vorsitzende , Mirek Topolanek , that the budget is terrible , and the government for their continued existence .
The ODS-Stellvorsitzende , Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of Beamtenkabinetts with the support of the ODS and CSSD , Grünenpartei is obviously not working any more .

Mandela was in the new movie by Clint Eastwood of Morgan Freeman played
The South Africans to claim that the new " Invictus : " The world lost a great deal of the country shows that of the fight and win despite some criticisms that the role of a American actors .
The story tells of sport , and Nelson Mandela .
The tireless campaigner against racism in the South African country as well as its first black president , Nelson Mandela , in his own life , the American Oscar-Schauspieler , Morgan Freeman .
Freeman said that he is aware of the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he saw him in Eastwood movie .
A further significant role to Matt Damon .
I said to him : ' If I play , I must remind you .
The actors , the prize for his role in the Eastwood-Drama from Boxbereich " Million Dollar Baby " who had received was already the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery , the end has become a fictitious USA-Präsidenten , and God in " Evan " omnipotent , but only rarely , someone who is still alive , and for many people as important as Mandela .
The former südafrikanischeStaatsmann was active for his work in ending the apartheid in the South African republic of 27 years in prison .
He was in 1990 to set free four years he has been president of the country .
In 1993 , he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
" Invictus " is the Latin word for " Ungeschlagen ' , and at the same time , it is the name of a Gedichtes of English author William Ernest Henley , which in 1875 .
The requirement , as he has to speak
The film recounts a true , in the Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of the South African Rugbyteams , Francois Pienaar , in order to rebuild the country . the new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still rassenmäßig and economically divided .
He thinks that his people through sport can be , so decides , he referred to the world to the outsiders , to do a deal .
Finally , there is the South African team to the World Cup of the year 1995 .
Freeman was working for a number of years in order to convince the Kinoleinwand .
He had no objective other than this role to play in order to work as closely as possible to the reality , said Freeman .
The biggest challenge was , of course , so to speak , as he has .
The actors said , if he and the global leaders in the same country , he would try to come to terms with Mandela's meeting with him last night to eat , and his speech behind the scenes .
The most important thing was for him , Mandela to shake hands .
I have noticed that when I tell you the hand schüttele , I will , your energy , it will , and I had the feeling that I know what they feel , " he said .
For me , it is important that a different person .
Matt Damon is in film François Pienaar , the captain of the national Rugbyteams , in which the white players .
The actors , he said that he has had six months to prepare for the role in the harsh Rugbywelt .
It was a great surprise for him when he , for the first time in his house .
I remember , when I think of the Türklingel klingelte that he opened and the first thing I said was : ' film François Pienaar in my life , I do not see much greater .
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models , he has , under the leadership of the director Eastwood " Invictus : Ungeschlagen " positive and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar .
The Filmkritiker Nury Daily Variety , Todd McCarthy , summed up his assessment in the following words : " That was a very good history , a very good film . "
In the Filmrezensionen on the Web-Seiten rottentomatoes.com , Invictus 76 per cent positive evaluations .
Lichtgeheimnis on Norway dissolved : the Russians have a missile tested
Norway was a particular Lichteffekt of unknown origin .
The Russian Defense Ministry has only yesterday admitted that not far from the Norwegian border in an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested .
The launch , however , was not successful and as a type of " Bulava " missile , which was originally the pride of the Russian army should be , is slowly turning into a nightmare of the Russian Generalität and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
His repeated presence on the ground in the Raketetest had no positive effect on the success of the Probeflüge .
Bulava is , in most cases on time or not at all in the air .
in Russian newspapers , you already have " Bulava " than a " missile , which do not fall apart . "
A missile which do not fly , but it stands to reason
This already 13 . attempt to was at the beginning .
Until the end of the flight , in turn , requires technical damage to the rocket .
Presumably the engine exploded in the third .
This time , " Bulava " from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij , which under the water of the White Sea .
This allows the launch , from the submarine .
It is therefore likely that by an unspecified fliegendes object caused the mysterious light on the damaged " Bulava " was .
In addition , the Norwegians , who , since the first moment did not doubt that it is a Russian rocket .
The Generalität has opposed this and claimed that it did not clearly from a failure to speak to .
The first two stages of the rocket fell is not enough and the accident was only the third stage .
In the previous cases , the engines in the first stage .
Even when there is no Teststart without mistakes , the leadership of the Ministry of Defence for only six out of thirteen .
The almost fünfzigprozentige success fulfilled the Generalität with optimism and so will continue to claim that the " Bulava " without any problems will be flying , and even to ten Hyperschall-Atomsprengköpfe with a weight of Max . 1.15 tonnes .

Czech discovery : a substance , even in the ' gestählten ' HIV-Viren wirkt
The team of Czech and German scientists testing the new links to the prevention of the spread of HIV-Viren in the body to prevent .
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also the viruses , which have already become resistant to medicines .
This fact against outweigh the drawback is that the link to the usual Virus-Varianten is not as strong as one of the already existing medicines .
The disease , AIDS cannot be cured .
The patient can Medikamentenzusammenstellung but life and the increase in the number of projects in the body .
their use , but it will be a series of side effects .
incomplete oppression of Virus-Vermehrung has also the development of SG . As a result , against the medicines are not more effective .
The work of the experts of the three institutes , the Academy of Sciences of CR , VSCHT ( Chemisch-technologische seminary ) in Prague , as well as by the university in Heidelberg , opens the way to deal with the address .
You have shown that as Metalokarborane what substances on the market , for the build up of HIV-Viruses is responsible .
The Metalokarborane are links from Bor , hydrogen , carbon and cobalt .
These links are blockading Virus-Vermehrung in other ways than all the medicines used today , so they can be overcome .
In their work , the scientists to new ' improved ' ties , on the basis of the knowledge of their attachment to the Viren-Eiweißstoff were being prepared .
The Metalokarborane have a unique structure : two vielfächige cages from the Bor - hydrogen - and Kohlenstoff-Atomen and by means of a Metall-Atom , in this case , cobalt , .
Heimtückisches and virus
HIV-Protease is Eiweißstoff of the HIV virus for the life cycle of the virus is essential .
Without the HIV-Protease caused HIV-Virus-Spaltung would not Infektionsvirenpartikel tyres .
If we are , we are also on the increase in the number of the virus in the body of the patient , the researchers in the press report by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR was issued .
In the paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry was published , the scientists describe as a whole ranks of the compounds , in which two couples cages ( see table ) , a brief organic chain linked to that are then systematically further .
a little lower , but reliable
The impact of this on a number of substances against the HIV-Protease wurdne in Reagenzglas tested , even against their steady ( resistant ) variations of HIV-infected patients .
The effect of the usual Enzym-Variante is not as strong , as in the case of the clinically used medicines , but they do not lose their effect on the Resistentvarianten , against which the widely used medicines often ineffective .
The unique Wirkungsmechanismus , as well as their other properties , such as biological and chemical stability , low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical Gestaltungen , makes the Metalokarboranen interesting links for further the development of more effective drugs against HIV Research , says Pavlina Rezacova , chief of the Laboratory for the institutes for organic chemistry and biochemistry and of the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences .
Because of a budget dispute . ODS was due to fishermen that fights back
The chairman of the ODS , Mirek Topolanek , has approved the budget for next year as " appalling " and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer , in his opinion , for their continued existence .
The statement from the ODS described the prime minister as a " strong . "
It is time for the analysis .
The deputy ODS-Vorsitzende , Petr Necas , said that the concept of the Beamtenkabinetts with the support of the ODS and CSSD , Grünenpartei is obviously not working any more .
After the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to stay in the house to the minority , when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit , or whether it is in order to remain in office , with the help of the Parlamentlinken .
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats , the problems of the public deficits is diametrically opposed to dissent , Necas .
Parliament has on Wednesday the budget for the year 2010 adopted , but with more than 12 billion kronor .
Parliament has the money for , for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers .
The government has the proposals put forward by the social democracy that is that they have hidden the budget deficit .
The Czech Republic should come with a backlog of 163 billion kronor .
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote , it is the desire of the government , because it is also the amended budget is only a less bad variant of Budgetprovisoriums Frase are clear .
frustration and futility
The finance minister , Eduard Janota , has about his disappointment and a sense of futility , while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated , that the government of the current situation .
Necas is convinced that , if serious with his resignation in case threatened that the amendments were to be adopted , the situation would look any different .
In accordance with the Czech television has on Monday after the premier .
In doing so , he has indicated that he will remain in office for another .
So is his frustration at the lack of budget .
The extent to which fishermen for the fight with the Budget-Defizit , have , in accordance with the Social Democrats ( CSSD ) , the changes in the budget , the government had nothing to do with that .
The premier should also make it clear that he will resign if the Parliament continues to Defizit-steigernde laws , for example , the pay and pensions of life , or the Dienstgesetzesnovelle .
Topolanek : the ODS nominated ministers were wrong not
That is the job of prime minister , fishermen and the government .
By the ODS nominated ministers have not made mistakes , Topolanek in a Textmeldung from the United States .
It has been mentioned that in some ministries in the role of vice-chairman , who are trying to top 09 , against the budget .
Necas stressed that if fishermen darür decides on the fight against the Defizit-Höhe of public finances , " it is perfectly logical and correct that it should be based on the Linksmehrheit is based , at the moment , in the parliament . "
Then he supposedly with the support and the tolerance of the ODS , do not .
I have not thought about , and , if it is to continue to crop up , then I will deal with it , said by the Bürgerdemokraten named Defence Minister Martin Bartak told the journalists in Parliament .
Premier fishermen flog this afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels .
The ODS came at the request of the prime minister .
At the same time stressed that the ODS is likely on Wednesday in parliament against the amended budget would vote if the premier , the members of the Bürgerdemokraten explicitly ask that the adoption of the budget .
We don't see ourselves as orphans , we are not little children , he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget due to the absence of the leader of the party in parliament , as well as in the Czech Republic not rolled back .
I have not noticed that my vote would lack .
Already , at the time of my mandate , I knew that in the next few months , above all , Parliament and the destruction of everything positive would go to Topolanek reacted .

Rose and Jancura Strafanzeige libel against three of the CSSD .
The owner of the student agency , Radim Jancura , today for libel against three sozial-demokratische leader .
against Michal Hasek from the District , Radko Martinek from the District and the head of the Bezirks Olomouc , Martin Tesarik .
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen Inteview in Radiojournal .
The complaint is linked to the effort made by the company , which in some districts .
All regions have , however , in the end , the long-term contracts with the Czech railways .
All three are the head of the US , and to say that we are favourites , we have taken the offer only on the scale of the proposals as to how it is fine with them .
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways because we have the prices of the Czech railways were aware of the previous week .
So , we have no option but to us .
Because of this slander of society student agency , said the Jancura Radiojournal .
At the same time , he said that he has evidence from all districts that they get their act together , in line with European law .
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission .
Hasek , the collection for the continuation of the Medialshow of Jancura him as free advertising for his company , as well as for his own person .
I am , of course , my good name and reputation in my Bezirks to defend , and I also call on the head of another .
I assume that this matter has to be made clear that there will be no Jancura , who in the matter of the general public to be manipulated and lügenhafte and untrue arguments used , said Hasek .
Jancura reported last week that he invested several million kroner in the advertising , based on the adverse effects of the districts to their attention .
The Radiojournal , he said that he supported the campaign after Christmas , and New Year wishes to continue .

The campaign has begun , after the districts at the behest of the Regionaleisenbahnverkehrs agreed with the Czech railways and for the task in a high 150 billion kronor , no invitation to tender put out to tender .
After this sort of behaviour is illegal and contravenes with the requirements of the European Court of Justice .
Because of the criticism of trains in the areas threatened him , according to Jancura , already a member of the CSSD .
The only threat was , if we do not do that , when that time comes , we will also lose .
He was as a member of the CSSD , I know who it is that is his name , I am not saying , said today the Jancura Radiojournal .
Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and voluntarily
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January the usual .
It was the first for the families free of charge and voluntarily .
But it is already seeking the floor vote that would be more effective .
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against Pneumokokken kulminieren .
This is already implementing the maximum prices of vaccines , the health insurance to pay for it .
The experts are also on the Impfungsverfahren .
The new vaccination
vaccines free of charge for August-Kinder
From January can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken children free of charge , on 2 August last year and later were born .
The condition that they have not yet received .
Those who are familiar with the vaccination in the past year or earlier , must also have to pay for that .
The first Impfdosis between 3 and 5 months old . of the child will be given .
Already last year , a quarter of the families to vaccinate their children against Pneumokokken .
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for a dose .
for the vaccination of the recent children are four doses .
As a whole , the experts that the health insurance for the Impfdosen between 300,000 and 450,000 kronor per year .
They save , but the treatment of the children without vaccination .
Until now , the state has for all of the children of around 500 , 000 per year .
The deal was struck with the so-called Janota-Paket introduced .
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzündung , but also cause serious infections , including Gehirnhautentzündungen and Blutvergiftung .
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen die in the US after investigation in hospitals each year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years .
Outside of the Czech Republic , the Pflicht-Impfung children against Pneumokokken in about 40 countries .
will the vaccine be mandatory ?
At the same time , said that this vaccination in future duty could be .
From January , this from the insurance paid for and be voluntary .
That would be better , for example , the head of the Bürgervereinigung nahlas , Rudolf Kalovsky .
His association has already been touted in the long term for the Pneumokokken-Impfung .
The experts at the international conference , to which our Union was involved , were not very satisfied that we are voluntary vaccination .
That is not exactly ideal .
On the other hand , we are pleased that we have succeeded , at least .
I believe that this is the road which we now need to go , Kalovsky .
The Department of Health , however , the Impfverfahren against Pneumokokken do not change .
At this moment in time , we are not at all , said his spokesman , Vlastimil Sesen .
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages , the doctors .
The chairman of the Fachgesellschaft of practical Kinderärzten , Hana Cabrnochova , that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks .
If all children vaccinated , then we could control the Wiederholungsimpfungszahl reflection " in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive it is , we have come to understand the political decision that this as a voluntary vaccination launched , " says allerdingst Cabrnochova .
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of the parents and their babies against Pneumokokken from next year .
Vaccination against Pneumokokken is ground-breaking , adding that this was the first by the health insurance paid for and not by the state .
Insurance companies should spend money for prevention , so save it for further treatment , erkärt Cabrnochova .
The doctors must make the vaccines themselves .
But there is also a concern the practical Kinderärzte linked to the purchase of vaccines .
According to the original plan , the vaccines purchased by the insurance companies and doctors then transmitted the same way , as well as other issues , the state you spent on vaccines .
Some members have feared , however , that the insurance , " so the money from the Krankenversicherungherausführen could . "
That is why the doctors the vaccines themselves , and to wait until the insurance you have to pay .
According to the estimates , the individual doctors per month 40,000 kroner to invest in , which is a significant sum of money .
This will not be easy , says .
Still you and we
Can the Islam in French ?
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state .
At a time when the Swiss voters for a Bauverbot for Minarette voted in favour and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread , John Bowen , a American academics , a thorough and thoughtful report written about whether Muslims into one of the most avowedly säkularisiertesten societies of Europe can be integrated into - and be integrated .
Some readers will this new book , out of admiration for the last work of the author : " why the French no Kopftücher Love " ( Originaltitel : ' why the hell don't like French headscarves " ) ( 2006 ) read , an elegant and densely argumentierenden study by a disputed the country for over a year and a half decades and employees and their effects even today .
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum .
As a good , he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in France , but what is really happening in the area .
He has few months in mosques , schools and institutes , are now taking the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France , as Bowen is called " Islamic window " .
He is a good listener , it , there are debates between teachers and students on the issues that matter most to them .
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a City Hall to marry ( or both ) ?
Should young Muslims on evolution and rights of homosexuals to be lectured about ?
A Muslim woman and a non-Muslim man to marry ?
It is permissible for a Muslim , a banking system in order to get a mortgage ?
It is these seemingly profanen affairs , he claims , the one that affects the daily life , in contrast to the political dramas in the media .
The author acknowledges that a new generation of imams , teachers and intellectuals , none of them with a well-known name , perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan , a born in Switzerland arabisch-muslimischen scholars and academics .
This new generation is trying to open up a debate on how it is possible , on the one hand , a good Muslim , and on the other hand , a good citizen in a modern secular society .
You do not have all the arguments on their side .
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam .
The thinkers and activists Bowen , with their Salafi-Gegenstücken usually divided - supporters of Sunni Islam , which is linked to Saudi Arabia - the nowadays , a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims .
Bowen is of the opinion that the Muslim values and French secularism be compatible .
But a convention requires give and take on both sides .
It is called into question the extent to which the French political leaders ( and the intellectual elite , which is so passionate about the separation of church and state are guarded ) really pluralism .
He suggests that Muslims may be a rauere treatment as Catholics , Protestants and Jews , which , in turn , their historical compromise with the secular republicanism .
He is more of a " tightening up " as a growing pragmatism .
Can the French Islam ? after reading this book , one is inclined to say ' yes , but not yet . "

Admiral Nelsons encounter with a polar bears as a 14 - year-old Fähnrich sea , only with his rifle butt Muskete fought , is certainly a myth , but there are others that are true .

Pakistani government officials plan to meet men to send to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday , leading to a head of a conspiracy , the aim of which , five men from Afghanistan to send to US soldiers to kill , and said that they hope the case could help with an extensive network of terrorist Anwerber to uncover the Internet after radicalised young men .

It is not an easy task , but it must be done now and there is no other way forward , that is .

Prüfungsdaten show persistent Rassenkluft
On the evidence of last week were a welcome good news for public schools in Washington D. C.
Despite the fact that Washington is still far behind the schools of the country , which is the peak of produce , show the evidence that the four - and in the last two years faster progress than cities , Atlanta , Chicago and New York , have done .
But what's most recent figures from the National Evaluation of the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) - is included , the stubborn Leistungskluft between African-American and white pupils , both at local and national level .
The average marks by the white Viertklässler from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years by 262 to 270 ( on a scale of 500 ) , their African-American gleichaltrigen rose but only by three points from 209 on 212 .
In reality , the Leistungskluft rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points .
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained basically the same , he was a statistically negligible amount from 245 to 244 .
The average of white students has not been included in the test data , since the Stichprobenumfang not big enough .
The picture on a six-year period from is not encouraging .
The gap between white and black Viertklässler in 2003 , when the first NAEP in this collection , was as much as 60 Skalenpunkte ( 262 to 202 ) .
And although the scoring , the children of both groups have achieved during this period has grown , the difference now with 58 points .
A number of council of the southern expressed last week expressed concern that the results of Schulkanzlerin Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty celebrated , for the most part of white pupils , who are already strong , children who are taken forward .
This suggests that we include the treatment of those at the upper end of the scale , which is complicated and difficult , said Jeff Smith , member of the board of the D.C. Voice , a nonprofit group that handles Bildungsgleichheit in Washington D. C. .
I will not vote for a period of two or three points , up and down , said the Democratic Washington Stadtratsmitglied , Kwame R. Brown , a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton-Grundschule .
Brown , a frequent critic of the Managementstils of Rhee , said , the message is that the secondary schools of the city requires urgent attention .
Of course , you can always see the positive signs that I respect .
What , however , I fear , is that we do not have the time and energy that we have for our use .
Rhee said that the Commission must continue , better to find ways to meet the needs of pupils .
This autumn , for example , will be some teachers trained a new Leselehrplan , Wilson-Lese-System to use , which is aimed at pupils in the upper classes in primary schools and Mittelschule , basic skills of reading , not at the beginning of their Schullaufbahn have mastered and significantly behind their peer groups .
Everyday Mathematics , a curriculum designed by the kindergarten class until the sixth games and experience in the first , and that was the former senior Schulinspektor Clifford Janey to Washington and this curriculum , some of the last week have been reported .
I believe that we are going to continue to work to ensure that the best measures the pupils which , on the pretext of Notenniveau , Rhee said .
Others say that the NAEP-Ergebnisse to highlight the issue of whether Rhee will proceed to the performance of the system to improve and will continue to be the extra money and resources for the schools can be made available between the two in order to narrow the gap .
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee , said Bruce Fuller , a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley , the urban audit findings .
The conventional cures is that its resources and to the schools , in some of the poorest areas of Washington , D.C. .
The political fallout could cause against this important item on the agenda .
The weak point is , of course , as in the case of other urban Schulinspektoren that they tried to storm the white and black middle class .
Our focus is to ensure that we have a system , a great schools .
We must strengthen our schools in districts , so that all families , regardless of where they live , we can be sure that their children are an excellent public school education .
Janey , who is now in Newark , said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for the closure of the Leistungskluft is the traditional public school year , in Washington at the moment , 180 days , to extend the Charter-Schulen to compete .

The coach is reaching the Gettysburg-College a home .
Graciela Rodriguez , 12 , and for a moment when I see the white pillars , and the turf .
Parents have the highschool in El Salvador .
Until recently , also had the Graciela in Silver Spring was salvaged and now in Riverdale , never set foot on a road .
Their attitude , and those of other members of the group , the Gettysburg , where the teaching per year costs $ was more of a ehrfurchtsvollen Besuchers than that of a future students .
" Yes , I will be soon ! " exclaimed Graciela , who would like to study medicine , as the leaders announced that they now have the buildings for natural sciences are entering .
" Wow , really ? " she said , as soon as the low Professor-zu-Studenten-Verhältnis school reported .
The college in Pennsylvania was 7 . , which the children on their three-day tour have visited and now they have the intended message out : the question is not whether amounting to the college .
The question is where .
On the one hand , there is a growing concern about the number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants the highschool not end or as teenagers become pregnant , on the other hand , there are also hundreds of thousands of the Collegeausbildung which is needed in order to join the middle class .
In truth , is one of five of this " second generation " of the college - which is a remarkable achievement , given that many of their parents , mostly from Mexico or Central America , the United States , without the highschool concluded .
Their success stories are important , say researchers , because it is fighting for a generation that has a huge role in the labor force of the country will be the way forward .
Those who say that these children , who often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent drive to success .
Many of them also have parents who give their children high goals and to find ways to address their lack of familiarity with American schools .
But they also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help , in the college to come , especially if these efforts over a long period of time .
If low-income children , whose parents did not have the experience and skills to help them through the system to help , then there will be a single measure to at any time , the problem will not be solved , said Patricia Gándara Forscherin , at the University of California at Davis , the students .
We have to think about , these children are a supporting network from pre-school age up to by the highschool .
The Bundesprogramm , Gracielas College-Tour financed , is a useful example .
It is known as the ' up ' - a gang - and more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems are available to be launched to start when low-income students in the Mittelschule and continue until they have completed .
In accordance with the US-Department for education , the programme has since 1999 , more than 10 million pupils , more than 60 % of the college .

Safety concerns , by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday have been emphasised and the political instability caused by the withdrawal of the US military , US oil companies will probably be held , said analysts , in Iraq , the world's third largest proven reserves in the world .
US firms were in some cases at a disadvantage , because competitors , especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies to lower wage costs , and more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders .
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum , Inc . were the only American companies which have signed contracts with the ministry .
More US companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips , which had nothing to do with the Iraqi ölministerium close relations and in recent years with the Council on the side , are empty .

We all know , said the spokesman , Assam jihad that China is on the way to one of the great of the world economy , as well as a Technologiemacht .
We are convinced that the Chinese companies with its Mitbietern can be measured and to fulfil its commitments towards Iraq .
For the Gebotsabgabe vorausgewählte companies gave commandments , which , with the fee per barrel of oil compared to the ministry was willing to pay to reduce the emission of each of the current level .

Defense Secretary Gates : Iran must comply with additional sanctions .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be " significant additional sanctions " on Iran sanctions , because he is not in talks on its nuclear plans are .
Gates spoke during a 7 - day trip to flee the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq , a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran .
In Iran , there are no good options for election , he said in response to the question of soldiers on the likelihood of such a development .
" One of the things that were on the soul is , if we are in the last six years have learned something from Iraq to the war on its own . "
The Obama administration prefers a Sanktionspaket in recital , which is based on the military and political elite of Iran , Gates has announced that some of the sanctions also could affect .
He said that a " package of positive and negative incentives " is needed , " to the Iranian government to convince you that with nuclear weapons , in reality , less is protected , " because " their people " under the sanctions .
On Friday , in a statement by the spokesman for the White House , Robert Gibbs , the American government , European leaders joined in the warning that Iran is " credible " consequences if he continues with its nuclear program , does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its atom-überwachungsorganisation , the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Iran claims that the knowledge of the nuclear power only for peaceful purposes .
During the talks in Geneva on October 1 , said the Iran , that he wanted the talks to resume its nuclear program and would seek a substantial part of its Lagerbestands to enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed Nuklearbrennstoff for its medical research reactor .
The US government has responded to this kind of agreement , in order to restore the confidence between the two parties and make time for negotiations .
Iran , however , since at this stage in the negotiations on the interim agreements , to be able to leave - in part , say experts , because the Iranian leadership is divided as to whether they are to the United States .
That Iran the international community with regard to some of the proposals , which they have already agreed at the beginning of October had simply left standing , has , frankly , the international community , including the Russians and the Chinese , in a way that brought together , as they have in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran never were , said Gates .
President Obama has set Dec . 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals , before he had other options , including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called " crippling sanctions , " will continue to follow .
In a statement in New York , Iran's representation at the United Nations on Thursday condemned what they " baseless allegations " and some members of the Security Council on the Iranian Atomaktivitäten called and said that they are ready to resume talks with the United States and five other world powers to continue , " in order to provide a long-term solution . "

The tension between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high , in particular with regard to borders , property rights and the distribution of public revenue .
Gates urged both sides , the potential for conflict in order to delay the US-Pläne to prevent the American force levels until the end of August by 115,000 to 50,000 .
Gates also sought to use the Kurdish concern about the forthcoming troop withdrawal . US-Vertreter quoted Gates , Masud Barzani , president of the Kurdish regional government , said : " We will ensure their security , prosperity , and their autonomy within a unified Iraq .
We will not leave . "
A change of direction in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by Propagandaplakaten to lecture them , that " mother earth is too tired to get more children to maintain " and " one more baby means one more tomb . "
These lessons have you learned so well that , when government officials in Shanghai by the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer , suddenly began to change course and young couples , more than to have a child , your answer and immediately said : " under no circumstances " .
We already have all of our time and energy in a child .
A second child is nothing more to be desired , said Wang , 31 , a Personalleiterin with an 8 - months old son .
More than 30 years after the introduction of the " one-child " policy in China , the two generations of notoriously dicklichen , verzogenen Einzelkindern , the " Little Emperor " - it has produced a Bevölkerungskrise in the country .
The average birth rate is 1.8 children per couple , compared to 6 at the time when the policy came into force , the United Nations -
Department for working program , while the number of population of 60 years and older , by the year 2020 from 16.7 per cent of the population by the year 2050 , 31.1 % will rocket . This is much higher than the global average of around 20 percent .
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with better educated population , such as Shanghai , and more .
Last year , 60 - year-old and older almost 22 per cent of the reported residents , while the birth rate under one child per couple .
Xie Lingli , head of the Shanghai Stadtbevölkerungs - and has said that couples of normal reproductive age babies must be " in order to help the relationship of the ageing population and a shortage of labour in the future to alleviate " .
Shanghai will soon " as old - but is not as rich as the industrialised countries , such as Japan and Sweden , " she said .
A gradual relaxation
In the constitution of the country in 1978 , China's " one-child " policy , the most controversial available by the ruling Communist Party to date has been introduced .
Couples who are opposed to this policy , must be with huge fines - up to three times their annual salary in some regions - and with discrimination in the workplace .
Chinese Staatsvertreter have attributed to this policy , the critical demands on the natural Landesressourcen was able to avoid , defenders of human rights abuses in the enforcement of the policy .
In rural areas , some officials pregnant women who already have a child were forced to stop .
Many couples have had abortions carried out , leading to a high ratio of men to women .
In recent years , government officials for population gradually changed its stance on the " one-child " policy .
In 2004 , they have become more exceptions to the rule allowed - including urban dwellers , members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been - and 2007 , it was the tone of many hard slogans .
Qiao Xiaochun , a professor at the Institute of Beijing University , said that government officials recently even more radical changes , for example , couples with two children to allow , in which there is a partner .
Shanghai in July , was the first Chinese city that an aggressive campaign to promote the use of more births .
posters , the families belehrten , only to have a child , have been almost overnight of directives which describe in detail as to who should pay for a second child to qualify and how to apply for the approval .
The city government has urban employees and volunteers for family planning , couples at home and fact sheets under the doors .
She asked also psychological and financial advice for the failure to make available more than a child .
The response was not encouraging , said .
The disappointing response
Although officials from a small town in the rural areas of Shanghai , said that a recovery in the applications of couples to see after the launch of the campaign , a second child , the urban districts , on the other hand , to no change .
In the municipality with a population of 115,000 than , for example , still a month only four to five applications .
Shanghai officials say that the expected for 2010 , the number of births in the city despite the campaign still at around 165,000 - slightly higher than 2009 , but lower than in 2008 .
Feng Juying , head of the Shanghai Municipality , said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children .
You want your first of its best , she said .
Yang , 27 , and his wife , Liu Juanjuan , 26 , said that they would like to have two children , and that that is legally allowed .
But they have , how many Chinese , only a minor health and life insurance , with the government .
Without a social network , they say , that decision would be irresponsible .
People in the west of the one-child policy as the human rights issue , said Yang , a civil engineer , and his wife in the seventh month of her first child is seven months pregnant .
Yes , we have an opportunity to have more than one child .
The problem , however , is not simply a policy .
The problem is money .
Other couples give psychological reasons for your hesitation .
Wang , the Personalleiterin , said she would just like a child , because it is also a Einzelkind . " We were at the heart of the family and are used to , that everyone around us .
We are not accustomed to , to care for others and we want to not really . "
Chen Zijian , a 42 - year-old , a übersetzungsunternehmen heard , she said .
For parents from the middle class , which has resulted in the birth rate is falling , he said , it is to be successful , and we must be selfish .
The age group of 20 - to 39 - year-olds grew so that their parents during the early days of the Chinese Kapitalismusexperiments fighting to see and you want to get a life for themselves , he said .
also a single child , he said , huge demands on the time for parents .
A mother with her social life for at least two years .
Then there are the Raumfrage - " must be to rebuild his home " - and the jarring - " if the child of 9 months old , is already a CV for the best nursery schools have . "
Most of his friends are ready to , this is a time , said Chen , but not two .
Our generation is the first to a higher standard of living has achieved , he said .
We do not want too many victims .
UNO-Gruppe is drafting a plan to reduce emissions
by the UN conference on climate change - which until now by wild and mutual accusations auszeichnete - has on Friday with the publication of a document , once again , a priority for the next 40 years , an ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases , with the developed nations in the near future , the biggest at the expense of shoulders .
The text , which is the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could , has both the remaining obstacles , as well as to the way forward .
But it has been seen as an important step forward in a negotiation , the time , since next week , more than 100 leaders from around the world arrive in Copenhagen .
The text , which is created by a special UN working group was established , has remained silent on the money supply , the rich countries to the poor countries , so that the short - and long-term global warming can deal with this .
He also offers a range of options for the key questions , including how industry - and large emerging economies to limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increases should be that the political decision-makers .
The process will be a great flexibility , so John Coequyt , a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington .
Michael Zammit Cutajar , the document has come up , has a 180 pages Verhandlungstext summed up , in order to focus on what the leading role of the UN , Yvo de Boer , as " the big picture " .
It shows the Buckingham Palace of a possible agreement , in which the industrialized countries together in their emissions by 2020 by 25 % to 45 % , compared with the limit values of 1990 , to reduce their emissions , while major developing countries , in the same period by 15 to 30 % .
Together , the countries could reduce emissions by 2050 by 50 to 95 % .
The European Community has made the talks on Friday , buoyed by their assurance that , over the next three years to 3.6 billion US dollars per year , in order to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change to adapt to - to cope with the floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation .
Friday , however , the same verbal Feuerwerke , which called for the talks in the last week .
The American Klimasonderbeauftragte Todd Stern has rejected the wording of the binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries , compared with voluntary reductions for the larger emerging economies , demand , if not by the industrial countries .
This train announced that the Obama administration is a tougher line with China , as a representative of the Bush administration , not more than two years ago .
The United States will sign an agreement , without any significant emerging economies to stand up and take action , Stern , which also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts would also be confirmed .
Stern gave its opinion about an hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vizeaußenministers He Yafei , said that the leading American Klimaunterhändler either " good sense " or " highly irresponsible " from him , that he was at the beginning of the week , said that the United States , China is not financially would help the global warming .
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake , both within the industrialized countries , as well as between the developed countries and the emerging fault lines .
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies , as well as on the saving of the planet , with China and the United States because of their relevant obligations , while poorer countries claim that the two dozen countries are the most influential scientific need to ignore what to take bolder steps .
Ricardo , a delegate from Costa Rica , said that it is not surprising that the major powers who are fighting to keep the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions should bear , because even the countries affected have returned to more aggressive and , in this respect , the countries with very high for what they did .
It is clear that this is a game , producing a new economic domination will develop , which also serves as a regional Klimawandelberater for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America .
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change , said that they would commit to a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen would fight , despite the fact that the leading participants say that the talks , in the best case , a political agreement .
The Group of the Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members on early Friday morning in a 24 - page draft treaty .
Artur Runge-Metzger , the international climate negotiations for the European Commission , said that the offensive of the small island states " political pressure on the entire political process , " in part because they are now coming together and there are measures of the emerging economies , such as China and India .
The talks were a new urgency when the delegates based on the fact that most of the outstanding issues before the arrival of the Regierungsführer will need to be resolved in order to reach an agreement .
High-level representatives , such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vizeminister entstiegen their aircraft and through the corridors of the Bella-Centers to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences , claims , during the course of the next week .
The sheer scale of the Assembly - 13,000 people , daily in the Kongresszentrum and , gitarrespielende activists hold a late-night shows , where they are on the countries make fun of , which in their view , betrayed and sell , and draft agreements will change hands rather than passed around by e-mail - is already a challenge .
The intensity is just this : almost all of the ministers are here now , and on Wednesday will be 60 in Copenhagen .
We are coming to the Oberliga , said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez , vice president for global policy of the organization of Conservation International .

Britain's first 225 km / h faster train defines the Montagsgefühl new
Monday morning at 5 to 13 , a pipe to penetrate the darkness in order to announce a revolution in transport in the United Kingdom .
The first in the country in its Blitzfahrt Ashfort , from Kent to London St Pancras 225 km / h and 93 km in 38 minutes .
Lord Adonis , the Transport Minister , will then Dame Kelly Holmes on board of the first Javelin-Pendlerservices from London .
He hopes that the new service to Britain , to an international network of faster , more reliable trains and the major urban areas of the Midlands , the North and Scotland to London .
The province could lead to vibrant Pendlerstädten , Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the switch from the plane and a car on the train would be the national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads .
In theory , the three major parties to this vision .
But the many billion British pounds for the construction of a new national network is needed but the unavoidable Planungsschlacht and raised fears of environmental damage could be among the British Hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen still put the brakes on .
High Speed Two ( HS2 ) , a company that in January the government should submit a feasibility study , Lord Adonis , according to the Times report on 30 December .
This has given a detailed Streckenkarte the next stage of the planned Hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetzes .
The new railway line linking London , the West Midlands , will combine with a margin of five metres of urban areas and in places where the effects on the environment are controversial .
In the free site if the plan is the concept of within a gap of 25 metres from the final route .
HS2 will also have three options for a wider , taller .
Lord Adonis will be in the spring .
The preferred option proposed is a Y-förmige routing , in which a single high-speed line to the West Midlands .
The route would be in or near Birmingham and a Abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland , and another in the direction of the north-east after Sheffield , Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne .
A single line would come after Scotland .
" It seems to be the best option to be functioning , " said one .
After the completion of the selection of the travelling time between London and Edinburgh to 2 hours 40 minutes .
The first , which does not hesitate to 2025 would be , it would allow passengers to pass , the London-Birmingham in 49 minutes , compared with a little over an hour to go .
The drafts of the trains with a speed of 400 km / h , thereby saving the British rail network is the most rapid of Europe .
The first line has been planned in such a way as to 400 metres long trains with a Maximalkapazität of 1,100 people insist .
Up to 18 trains per hour could fall by the wayside in operation .
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be needed , on the 20 , 000 passengers per hour .
given the space limitations in the capital expected that an existing railway station to be developed in order to face up to the high-speed network .
To say that only St Pancras International , or Euston this potential .
Lord Adonis will know whether this plan in his opinion should be continued or not , but the lengthy public consultation and mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections .
But even if the wheels in motion , to be put to the rail network in sections were built .
Trains would have to first from the high-speed lines on existing railway lines in the north of Birmingham , the travelling time between London and Scotland will continue to hold more than three hours .
This is a crucial point , so that a switch from air to rail , we will be able to ensure a comes into its own for the Schienenrevolution .

And I would have the whole sum can ask for , but I do not do it . "
The house , a millionaire from his former career as a ölgroßhändler , was the first time in May because of its spending attacked , as soon as it became clear that he was thousands of pounds for his garden before he is due to meet with the fees office that " as excessive demand could be considered . "

The producer has the Neurochirurgen Dr Stéphane Delajoux , calling the singer on 26 November in the Clinique International du Parc Monceau in Paris , which has been operated on .
They told us that he had a parody of the massacre .
The surgeons of Los Angeles said that they were completely shocked , said Mr Camus .
I have heard that there is a risk that we will take legal proceedings , he said .
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday " far too quickly and with the permission of the Paris surgeons travelled to Los Angeles . "
I have personally spoke on the telephone with this doctor , who assured me that he sees this trip as completely without its problems , I am very surprised , because I already have two Bandscheibenoperationen behind me , " he added .
Shortly before he went to RTL , announced that the singer apparently after the operation , " with no drainage , without anything " to leave hospital .
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known .
He had the actress Marie Trintignant , a few days before her death in Vilnius , in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine , in which he at this point in time .
In 2007 , he had the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg operated on a Hämatom after a Gehirnblutung to resorbieren .
He is , however , also a doctor with dubious reputation , which is already several times due to operations and not to forget , and fraud .
Olivier Metzner , lawyer of the doctors , has described him as " a man without scruples " , " regularly " before the Kammervorstand has to take responsibility and " anything other than to be . "
After a few days of silence in Dr Stéphane Delajoux on Friday on his lawyer , David me to make a statement .
This stated that the intervention would be " perfect " and the investigations were " normal " .
The operation , called for " no bleeding and therefore requires no drainage , " he added .
In any case , it seems that the tour of the Sängers , whose health problems since the summer in question .
It is quite clear that it is obvious that it is a continuation of the tour on 8 January ( in Amiens ) something is short , Mr Camus .
The Frente Union for French Democracy ( UDF ) will vigorously and calls for the party Nouveau Centre , not the more you Siegel to use
The Frente by François Bayrou's party Modem is monitored , announced on Friday a übernahmeversuch of the label , which once controlled by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing party , on the part of the chairman of the party's Nouveau Centre , Hervé Morin , provoked a strong reaction and the threat of a judicial persecution to stamp on the document , more .
Hervé Morin , has publicly declared his intention to question this , because he thought that François Bayrou , the company would not worthy of this political legacy to defend after he left a hand to .
The minister of defense , whose Parteipartner the UMP is , by the way , this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC .
On the strength of his efforts , he had the support of Mr Hervé de Charette ehemalig ( UMP , now in the NC ) received a claim on the property of the UDF , because he was the first to this brand in 2004 , the Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle ' .
However , the Geschäftstelle of François Bayrous's friends supervised Parteienbündnisses UDF silence and gave us to understand that they are not expropriate and set fire to the minister as well as the MPs under the threat of a judicial persecution of a deadline , this code is no longer to use and the property rights of the brand .
You have in the last few days , a number of statements that they have their political movement would propose that UDF-Siegelzu + + , wrote the Frente in a , 19 of the 24 Büromitglieder signed the letter , including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez , the party modem and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance .
They also believe that they have the right to the name of this movement , Nouveau Centre + + + , the slogans of today's UDF + , on their political material as well as on the its website .
As you know , they have no right to the use of the label , and the secretariat of the UDF and calls for the party to " immediately , the mere mention of the name of UDF sämtlichem material and ( their ) website to remove . "
In addition , requested by Mr Hervé de Charette , " the property rights of the brand to its legal Anspruchsberechtigen ' .
If they refuse , we will take legal action against them , in order to ensure respect for the law and the legitimate rights of the UDF-Mitglieder to defend the undersigned warned .
In your letter , you emphasised that " UDF " since 1978 , a fully-fledged political movement and remind us that Morin and his friends , " the election have made " this 2007 to leave in order to build a competing movement , as has been done in 2002 , in order to gain the party UMP " platform " .
The party Nouveau Centre has , therefore , the undersigned , according to any rights , UDF-Siegel ( Union pour la démocratie Française ) .
You will recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 after three years of accession to the Modem party , together with the establishment of a secretariat to defend " the material and moral interests " by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing founded in movement , has adopted .
What Mr Hervé de Charette , the Secretariat , " he was at the time when he received the brand name , has for the last three years is no longer a member of the UDF , " but the UMP .
He benefited from the scandalous and fraudulent , from the absence of the deposit of the UDF in order to do this for themselves .
You will have to continue to bear in mind that this recklessness on the best ways to become involved in a crime , and the strategy of the NC : " It seems to us , but in politics , as in life , itself a name , rather than try to take advantage of the anonymity to come by , based on fraudulently received a name , on which there is no legal rights " .
Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will persuade exploitation of weakness condemned
The court in Nanterre , on Friday decided to cancel the artists François-Marie Banier , in order to determine whether he , as the daughter of Milliardärin Liliane Bettencourt , claims that a weak moment of Achtzigjährigen has exploited in order to make a portion of their assets .
The 62 - year-old photographer for his Starfotos is known , will be on 15 and 16 April 2010 because of exploitation of weakness before the court to answer a criminal offence , with a maximum of three years imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros .
This decision means that it is in fact a process in this case , the saga is one of the richest families is worthy of France , where the mother and daughter and at the same time the reins of the L'Oréal Kosmetikimperiums day in , day out .
Equally , however , ordered the 15 criminal division , a medical study of the 87 - year-old Liliane Bettencourt , which jointly by three doctors carried out .
The inheritor and Hauptaktionärin of L'Oréal , so far , has refused to face such a study , above all , not among the during the investigations by the public prosecutor's office in Nanterre presented conditions .
The doctors should be appointed on Friday before the 10 March 2010 will be submitting a report in which they clearly indicate whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt to remain in a state of weakness was found .
I think that you will handle the investigations .
I will speak with her , said the lawyer , Mrs Bettencourt , Georges Kiejman , after the hearing .
With regard to the lawyer , Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers , Olivier Metzner , he is with the decision of the court .
This is an excellent news ( ... ) . The report will show that he ( Banier ) this old lady manipulated , which must be protected , he said .
For the last two years , the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt , a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier , photographer and Allroundkünstler , and accused of him , the weakness of their mother for years to have exploited to donations totalling one billion euros in the form of Bankschecks , insurance policies or Gemälden .
Liliane Bettencourt , for its part , had always been refuted by the photographers have been manipulated , which they regard as a long-time friend .
Although the court the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers launched to examine the complaint , the lawyers on Friday , to a large extent .
For example , the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt on three of its Klientin their notary versandten letters ( 1999 , 2003 and 2005 ) , in which she wrote that the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers distrusted .
According to her lawyer added Liliane Bettencourt , the following : " could you please my daughter to explain that I am for 15 years , a - up to twice daily to Banier wrote .
Françoise , I have since their marriage will never be able to talk about . "
The public prosecutor's office in Nanterre is , once again , that the plaintiff had no right to do so , mainly because a Vormundschaftsrichter in the last few days , your request has rejected a lawsuit against their mother .
Liliane Bettencourt " is fully rechtsfähig , not protection and has no legal guardian .
No one has the right to act on their behalf , " the representative of the public prosecutor's office , Marie-Christine Daubigney .
The court has now decided to make a judgment after the process leading to the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place .
or the end of the strategic Frühaufklärung ?
If there is no change to the leadership of the great French company has our fight for the development of the economic intelligence have been in vain ...
For over a decade , the attitude of the management of large companies in terms of its staff , said the position of companies vis-à-vis the consumer before the Marketing-Revolution : it is for staff to join the ' values ' is the best , as it was on the Consumer-Produkte by the technicians in the work in such a way .
The customers at the heart of the company has the Marketing-Revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in the on the ground ... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again !
a demobilisation of staff can lead to deadly demoralisation .
The suicides at France Telecom , PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much bigger phenomenon , which involves in particular employees .
This has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company , in particular those of F
Indeed , calls on the ( ie intelligence Economique = economic intelligence ) " by all parties concerned ( ... ) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision " ; they are used by the staff of a bet on the instructions of the authoritarian management completely .
That is why we are calling for a revolution which would involve workers in the concerns of the company on an equal footing , in addition to the customers .
The very conditional use of internal polls
The internal audit opinion polls , as the questionnaire , the Orange his Lohnempfängern , this revolution in relation to the Management-Praxis suggest ?
I fear that , unfortunately , is not .
- first , because I could see that the whole fabric in the face of a new situation after many Umwegen , finally , in this respect , as a matter of priority to do ... what it has always done .
Also because the authoritarianism - one of the power - in proportion to the importance of his own failures .
And , finally , because most of the leaders of a simplified notion of human behaviour .
It has emerged from the large Ingenieurschulen is your interpretation of the psychology mechanistic .
You take the intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory , which was recently approved by the US " neuroscience " reactivated and unknowingly far-reaching research institutes and through the media .
As it is , and it suggests that it is possible to " leverage " ( sic ) on the involvement of employees , reinforced a aktuellein Le Figaro.fr erschienene survey by Ipsos , executives in an attitude of a management system for the world of today is not the right one .
The Mobilisierungsfaktoren identify and measure
Instead , is a prerequisite for the smooth functioning of the modern companies need occupational revolution to the adoption of a final view of human behavior .
It is that there are any idea or practice of steering a protocol to integrate : for the workers is the commitment to the company , will only be possible if it is clearly as a means of which seems to me to be a part of their dreams , their ambition and their projects .
At the moment to take only the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this idea of the motivation of the staff .
These studies have shown that they are putting their businesses on the basis of a set by DOXA to judge them by their wahrgenommenes picture of the company , to assess what it to them for their Lebensziele .
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these Mobilisierungsfaktoren can the executives of the companies for their " social " , and to anticipate and human resource management back to the right place .
So they are creating a fertile breeding ground for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence .
The speech by Oslo : the " just war " brings Obama praise from the right a
The American has the same rights on Friday by President Barack Obama on the eve of the speech in Oslo and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel peace prize to the concept of a " just war " against the enemies of the United States .
The Conservatives , the allocation of the prize to Obama on 9 October scoff at this time had given impetus to the speech of the President , the example of the former in the elections of 2008 Sarah Palin .
I liked what he said , Palin , the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today , and added that they themselves have raised the issue of the " necessary " war in ihrensoeben published memoirs .
The war is , of course , is the last in which I think the fact that the Americans want to do , but it is necessary .
We need to stop the terrorists over there , " she says .
Obama , of the two world wars by his predecessor George W. Bush inherited , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and has been on Thursday in Oslo , the use of violence to justify ; a way in which his Entscheidungvon nine days ago to explain to 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan .
Another opponent of Obama , Newt Gingrich , are of the opinion that the Präsdent in Oslo " very good job " .
I found that the speech is really very good , the former president of the House of Representatives , in particular the reference to ' the existence of evil in the world , " in the words of Obama's .
In some parts of this speech at all as historic , said in the radio programme " The Takeaway " was questioned .
The members of the European Parliament , by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election , said that he was pleased with a " President of the left " to have seen the members of reminding us of the fact that they are " not free and pay a price for peace does not hand out if the use of force would not exist . "
For Michael Gerson , a former Schreiber of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post , Obama has " a very American speech " .
In addition to all this , that he is as " Kosmopolit " , such as " he always has power " , he has " as an American president spoke , " he pointed out that the Europeans , " as in a live , they do not create and for their protection they do not do a great deal , " says Gerson .
Among the few , not the firm rights called the former UNO-Botschafter John Bolton , a hawk , the era of Bush's speech on the website of the National Review Online as " boring , unfocused . "
On the left of the president , the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama the recourse to the armed forces .
packaged the war under the guise of the judiciary , the massacre of innocent , quite simply , to justify , it warns .
The press of the moderate left , however , remains a praise on the side of the president .
The Los Angeles Times , which is still believes that the premature Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Obama , has called the address even for a speaker as for his talent , who is known as " Monumentalwerk . "
The speech in Oslo " offers a Ablaufplan on the management of international decisions against the conflicts , poverty and oppression , " the California's daily newspaper .
The New York Times is of the opinion that Obama " the necessary discourse proclaimed " and described his speech as " bleak and exemplary and at the same time . "

The Stundensatz for workers with the lowest wages , so instead of 8.72 million to EUR 9.06 euros .
" It is not very much , but we are the first to start , " says Patrice Clos ( FO ) .
The activists will now be instructed not to block it .
" It , however , will probably always be some recalcitrant , along with the agreement are not satisfied , " he added .
The TLF-Vorsitzende Philippe Grillot spoke of a " good agreement " , although " it is difficult to bring this wage increases in the face of international competition " .
According to him , the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and 100 to 120 million for the high wages .
" This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees , " says Maxim Dumont ( CFDT ) , whereas Thierry Douine ( CFTC ) of " a historic agreement . "
Richard Jaubert ( CGT ) said there were about " an acceptable compromise . "
The agreement also provides for the increase in travel expenses by 3 % , as well as the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010 , which , in particular , will enable the issue 13 Monatsgehalt and the modernisation of collective agreements .
M. Bussereau reminded us that " it will reduce the burden on employers of EUR 100 million in " for an amendment to the government bill to berichtigten finances for 2009 was in the middle of the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly has been adopted .
The government calls a " identical " vote by the Senate .
The signature of the TLF , which ensures that the agreement would first like to thank you for this organisation affiliated companies , and that in the event of an extension of the employment ministers for the whole profession .
This will be " in a very short period of time " of the case , said Bussereau .
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the procedure .
The association has denounced a " fraudulent trade ' , because , according to the 100 million euro ' were the sector to offset part of the carbon tax has already been promised . "
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us as soon as possible to negotiate , but not on the basis of a common analysis , but the winter Weihnachtstagen avoid disgruntling , laments the UNOSTRA .
for the Association of OTRE threatens the agreement " to small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector in the coming 12 months , a grave . "

A new Silicon-Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city , for Western visitors .
Selenograd , one of ten districts in the capital Moscow , was in the Soviet Union , a strict bewachter location for the secret defence research .
Today , the municipality with 216 000 inhabitants , 37 km away from the Moscow Centre , known as the " Silicon Valley " .
significant research and production in the micro - and nanoelectronics lie here .
Since September 2008 , had contacts with representatives of Selenograds Frankfurter Wissenschaftsstandort Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the firms of Frankfurt Innovationszentrums ( FIZ ) .
There have been a number of mutual visits and on Wednesday now signed Selenograd Riedberg in Frankfurt and a " protocol for closer cooperation . "
The mayor of Moscow Yuri Vize-Bürgermeister Rosljak and Präfekt Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation for Frankfurt signed Planungsdezernent Edwin Black .
By 2010 , the representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies in the science for a seminar after Selenograd travel .
scientific exchanges
It is about a continuous scientific exchange .
But it is also about economic relations .
firms of the FIZ will allow it to respond to the growing Russian market .
want to heed Russian Wissenschaftsfirmen contracts in Germany .
It is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies .
For example , these include the Moscow Institute for Elektronentechnik , large corporations and Rosssijskaja Elektronika .
The municipality was in 1958 as a so-called " socialist " for the defence research , have been established .
Selenograd ( literally translated as " Grünstadt " ) received its name from the forest , in which the research institutes are embedded .
Stuttgart Bremsklotz
The dimension of the Stuttgart 21 cannot be high enough .
For advocates of the project , it is purely and simply to " the new heart of Europe ' .
Rightly so . it is much more than that of a station's , more than a construction project , which the city the provincial capital for a decade in shambles .
Stuttgart 21 is the spirit of the 1980's .
With lines , right in the middle of the city , was seen at the time as a verkehrstechnische fossils of the 19th century , as a modern rail transport , as it was once a huge amount of time , locomotives from behind forward umzuspannen .
There , in short , to travel further - so what .
And that is why should the Kopfbahnhöfe disappear : in Frankfurt and Munich .
And in Stuttgart : a Durchfahrtsbahnhof who failed to see the trans-European Schienen-Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - that is , therefore , the slogan of the " heart of Europe ' .
Indeed , is now being addressed , despite the fact that the visions of the 1980s no longer with reality .
Even very ambitious planners have decided that it is in and the Bavarian city almost priceless , that is .
However , we have no one - and more , since it with modern Wendezüge locomotives and Steuerwagen at both ends .
Still , the Stuttgart 21 ICE-Neubaustrecke after Ulm is now being addressed .
State and local politicians have failed .
The power with , not least because the risks of the biggest of the Republic of the taxpayers and not the Staatskonzern .
The project is still reasonably justified .
There is new Stadtraum , which - if we are to believe the computergenerierten illustrating the planners - with a lot of green .
For the rail transport system is harmful .
The Durchgangsbahnhof and are in favour of the free movement of persons , which is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth .
At that time , there were not the competition from low-cost carriers .
modern transport policy needs to be dealt with first , freight transport , as the transport of goods by rail than by significantly more environmentally friendly lorries on the roads .
But the Neubaustrecke taugt because of intense Steigungen not for freight trains .
Even more serious is the fact that S21 , also of many other Bahnprojekte .
All of six billion euro in Schwäbischen verbuddelt .
That is the official number .
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion for realistic .
What is clear is that in the next decade , the money will be allocated to other hubs and Engstellen in the network .
A total of 60 major projects are on the World Heritage list .
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180 - kilometer route through the Rheintal .
Since 1987 , will be attending the route in slow motion .
As a matter of urgency , it would be necessary to do the right thing on the tube .
But as a brake .
The race will be for international freight transport : right in the heart of Europe .
The government is considering a verdict on the airport
The national government has left open whether against the judgment of the hessischen Verwaltungsgerichtshofs ( VGH ) on the ban on night flights in review .
The CDU / CSU FDP-Koalition have experts , in order to more than 400 pages of VGH-Urteil legally able to sell , said Economy Minister Dieter Posch ( FDP ) .
The VGH in Kassel on these days , in writing , that the country is in the case of the construction of the planned Nordwest-Landebahn at Frankfurt airport , the new rules .
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m. , as the national government , not with the legally necessary to protect the population against the noise of night flights .
The coalition has to be extended until 4 January to decide whether to appeal against the judgment in the revision .
The opposition criticized the suspension and drive on the representatives of the government , in a review of the Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig .
SPD-Fraktionschef Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called for the CDU and the FDP to come back to her before the election promises on a ban on night flights . otherwise , this is a " breach of promise " .
It is hellishly difficult when you try to keep their word , Tarek Grünen-Chef al-Wazir said in an allusion to the " we hold the floor . "
The minister refuted the accusation by the provincial government attempts to come to terms with " and " but their night flights .
A close legal scrutiny do not need to spend their time .
The coalition was not on the basis of a " rapid first impression " .
We need a legally certain Entscheiung , said Stefan Müller ( FDP ) .
Therefore , as the opposition , the statements of his group never banning night flights .

Yesterday evening , the body on the vote .
The favorite was Peter Frey , the head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudios in Berlin .
A confirmation from the station , there was , however , not officially , did not attend the trial .
However , I also have played a role , the ZDF-Intendanten Markus Schächter not to damage , should this proposal to the board of directors , do not get through .
Frey , a candidate needs the support of nine of the 14 .
The result of the vote in this magazine is not assured .
Two weeks ago , was with his proposal to cancel the contract with Nikolaus Brender , another five years to extend on the board .
Only seven members of languages for Brender , seven members voted against him . the defeat was a defeat for Schächter , a erwartbare , however .
Because the Unionsmehrheit on the board had already weeks before the election , not in office to confirm .
Organised by the opposition against the editor-in-chief of the Prime Minister Roland Koch .
With the argument , Brender , the news of the ZDF to Einschaltquoten lost , has refused to accept a further term of office .
until shortly before the election , there was therefore protests , in which the political influence on the ZDF castigated .
Last , but not least , had even 35 Staatsrechtler in the debate , the waiters , as unconstitutional .
Nothing came of it .

He was politics , teaching methods and Romanistik .
After that , he worked in the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau .

In the will , in any case , the liberal left-wing Frey .
The study will be entrümpelt
A partial success for the students : after a year of Bildungsstreiks , the culture ministers of the countries on Thursday , at last : a meeting of ministers of culture - and both sides agreed to study conditions in bachelor and master improve .
The students will need in the future to be able to complete their studies .
In particular , they agreed to work towards the Prüfungsbelastungen : generally speaking , each Studienmodul only with a single scrutiny .
In addition , the workload of the students to be reviewed and " a realistic and reasonable level " .
Politics and universities want the recognition of Prüfungsleistungen between universities within and outside of Germany .
The countries committed themselves to this , common Strukturvorgaben for bachelor and Masters and more flexible .
different Länderregelungen it should , moreover , does not .
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June , ministers and the common dictum of better Studierbarkeit in their mouths .
Now it was for the first time with a specific content .
The so-called Akkreditierungsrat decided to increase the number of tests , in part , to drastically reduce : " each module includes usually with only one test ' , it says in a 30 - second Seiten-Papier woodworking courses are part of new rules .
With the " , a significant reduction in Prüfungslast ' , the Akkreditierungsrat-Vorsitzende Reinhold Grimm , should consider a " shift to put a stop to the Studierbarkeit considerably . "
In addition , the " Studierbarkeit " in the future , " the decisive factor " in the design .
module as content were " strictly in order to ascertain " whether " unnecessary Einengungen students in the choice of the
events " .
The students had " claim to the margins , to gain the initiative and promote . "
to apply the rules in the context of the approval , but also in the review of existing courses .
These must be every five years " reakkreditiert " - which means , however , that by 2015 , it will take until all the courses of study .
responsible for this are bundesweit ten Akkreditierungsagenturen , which was set up by the countries .
The ministers of the countries in October " strongly " urged to join the agencies to promote the idea that is not too big and not too strict .
In individual Länder , universities and technical colleges with the Landesministerien already on the appropriate measures .
In a single country , saying Rheinland-Pfalz for the further development of the Bologna process , additional funds .
of the money , the universities , above all , Tutorenprogramme and Studienberatung and audit and control .
country and universities want to EUR 10 million .
At the beginning of 2010 , the government is an amendment of the parliament .
After this is supposed to be for the conclusion of a just a single audit .
The Studiengestaltung should become more flexible , this should also be the recognition of other universities , and access to the master .
By the end of next year , all the courses of the country on their Studierbarkeit reviewed .
The government and the opposition had on Thursday once again on the study conditions in the country .
In addition to praise , though , there was also criticism of the decisions .
The Bundesvorstand the Juso-Hochschulgruppen called for the design of the education policy should in future no longer be " behind closed doors " of ministers and Hochschulrektoren .
at the latest after the Bildungsstreiks should now also the students affected " to have a say . "
support the future academics by the president of the Hochschulrektorenkonferenz ( HRK ) , Margret Wintermantel said : " We need the experience of the students , " she said on Thursday in a meeting with the ministers of culture with which the HRK on a common disorder .
The trade union of Education and Science ( GEW ) , the Bonn process as a whole does not go far enough : it calls for a legal right to each graduates with a Bachelor-Abschluss access to a secondary Masterstudiengang .
On the other hand , the countries must ensure that for today's generation of sufficient Masterstudienplätze Bachelor-Studierenden tomorrow with the best possible Studienbedingungen available , so GEW-Vorstandsmitglied Andreas Keller .
These countries need more teachers .
A freer access to master the culture minister , however , did not .
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
In Germany , and it is almost impossible to control ... " is the one of the Gedichts Lyrikers Werner Söllner , in which this in verstörenden Sprachfetzen Ankunftserfahrung one of the dissidents , the freedom , but at the same time , his language area .
The 1951 in the Romanian Banat born Werner Söllner had first as German - and Englischlehrer in Bucharest and , later , in a Kinderbuchverlag worked before it in 1982 to Frankfurt am Main .
Söllner with various Literaturpreisen excellent . in 1993 , the legendary Frankfurter Poetikvorlesungen the Goethe-Universität , and since 2002 , he is the head of the hessischen Literaturforums in Mousonturm in Frankfurt .
For a außerliterarisches furniture he last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich , when it comes to the " German literature in Romania in the mirror and Zerrspiegel their Securitateakten " .
visibly confused and to read out a statement in which he rumäniendeutschen Schriftstellerkollegen , Richard Wagner , William Totok , Franz Hodjak , and Helmuth Frauendorfer , its cooperation than in the Romanian Securitate secret service had lost .
Together with some of those present had Söllner 1989 the German Sprachpreis .
The Anwerbungsversuche had begun , first in 1971 .
I am , therefore , " someone who is against the attempts to intimidate the Securitate not enough . "
The lyricist , Werner Söllner is Walter .
Almost at the same time as the Nobelpreisehrung for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary encounter with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule , the Literaturszene and , in particular , the community from Romania stammenden German authors produced by a shaken the Abgründe and a political system of power , which is based on monitoring and spying .
Werner Söllner , so far we can say , not only the perpetrators , but also of the victims .
In his Securitate-Akte in Walter played a role , said according to the confession of the Söllners Literaturwissenschaftler Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of the Walter .
He had it in for him at the time , " sensitive points , " Markel .
It is a moral need to highlight this remark to make .
The statement was in the form of this audience and , unexpectedly , completely surprising is the commitment of a former dissidents and its cooperation with the Romanian secret service does not .
Germany is a cosy Reservat for Securitate-Spitzel would have been , had Herta Müller in July in the period , after having their own act , 914 sides , read .
The people concerned , it must be remembered that will be spent on housing and in some case may also have known what Klarname behind the Decknamen Sorin , and Walter .
Unlike the now very verfahrenssicheren to sift through the Stasi-Akten is dealing with the legacy of securitate-überwachung still very vague .
A systematic education over the past couple of years , and has been hampered .
A National Council to come to terms with the Securitate-Akten ( CNSAS ) was set up in 1999 , the launch of files was since then , however , remains sluggish .
Only since 2005 , there is a law that the management of the files .
The influence of a former Securitate-Mitglieder in Romania is still very high , after the announcement of the winner of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview in which a former Securitate-Chef from Temesvar abfällig on her prize .
You have a climate of fear ; after all , I am only once they are interrogated .
The power that is quite openly , in the shape of the freedom of expression .
Certainly on the case , as is so often the case in connection with verschwiegener fault , the inevitable questions .
Why only now ? who has been hurt ? the calm reaction of the Zuhörenden on Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of Wissensdrang than from blame and shame to be determined .
to Genese of Herta Müller , who yesterday , the Nobel Prize has received , it is more than a footnote .
Champions League
It felt as if she had just provided a adrett gekleideter Außendienstler from a nice Christmas party , at which an Sportartikelhersteller goodies distributed when the new VfB-Trainer Christian Gross in the company of a orange Plastiktüte of Ausrüsters a quarter of an hour after midnight in a herbeigerufene C-Klasse rose .
The man with the markanten Glatze was because of him in a foreign city .
Otherwise , he would also be able to travel - alcohol was not involved , and , fortunately , it was still drunk on the 55 - year-old as too little .
It was a pleasant tonight , but tomorrow , the work continues .
Or is the right one .
In the words of the only three days earlier , pledged : " We have achieved , " in the Champions League thanks to the 3 : 1 - success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania , " but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success : it will be a hard fight against brutal decline . "
The " much more important task " on Sunday .
It will then be necessary in Mainz in the Königsklassen-Leistung Liga-Alltag .
And once again revealed weaknesses in the aftermath of the rapid three gates by Marica ( 5 ) , ( 8 ) and Pogrebnyak ( 11 ) .
tellers
The final 8 of the Champions League ( Hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / Rückspiele 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March ) will be on 18 December in Nyon .
The joy on the commencement of the Babbel-Nachfolgers remained so .
not only with the supposed Heilsbringer , Stuttgart , professionals in the short time , dedication and Spielfreude gives .
I am interested to hear the players received and I have told you that they focus on their strengths , and I have listened to you , more courageous , said Seelenklempner gross simple recipe for success , but no Therapeut Babbel is no longer in existence .
He has a certain magic , there were Babbel-Befürworter Jens Lehmann , " If in football is a new impetus , happen sometimes things which we would not have thought possible . "
and Sami Khedira , weeks after Verletzungspause thanks to its dynamic straight to the best players on the field , tried to buy the " phenomenon " with the proverbial " a breath of fresh air " and the operation of the new superiors : " He is a man who , and discipline .
That is what we need in the current situation . "
Under Babbel had it because obviously you know .
The VfB Stuttgart was not yet out of the woods , warns Sportvorstand Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs but , above all , Konstanz .
As gross herding , players and managers , the victory against a ersatzgeschwächte and totally überforderte defenses of the Romanian guests .
They would also have won in Glasgow , before four days later in Leverkusen , at 0 : 4 evil Awakening has come , Khedira .
And Sportvorstand Horst Heldt warned that , although a Saisonziel has been achieved and the other is still a long way off .
We are still not out of the woods .
That Heldt on his 40th birthday , even after the first three months , not celebrating , it was the fault of the events of the weekend in the form of a just before Spielbeginn ausgestrahlten Fernseh-Interviews of Torhüter Jens Lehmann fresh blossom .
There are decisions that other meetings , and not the Jens , konterte Heldt the criticisms .
The board of directors had accused of weakness shown , and become the Trainerwechsel pressure pubertierender fans determined .
also that his free day after play had been removed , wertete Lehmann is seen as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy .
statements are " pure egotism , " keilte Heldt and announced that it would have consequences for the Schlussmann .
They will probably not be friends for life , the more the two forty .
After all , but they were all agree that without the preparatory work by the abgelöste Trainerteam the casinos and a strong idea that would not have been possible .
Babbel and his assistants had " a large share of the success , " said Heldt and Lehmann - and the man with the Plastiktüte agreed .
In the heavyweight
Duell in Bern : again and again provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures .
But after 12 hard rounds , defended the Ukrainians Schwergewichts-Titel after his version of the WBC .
The verdict of the judges argue was unanimously .
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko Box-Weltmeister remains in focus .
The 38 - year-old champion after the WBC version of the losers on the night of Saturday in Bern the Americans Kevin Johnson , acting unanimously after points ( 120 - 108 , 120 - 108 , 119 - 109 ) .
for Klitschko , it was the third successful Titelverteidigung after his comeback in October 2008 .
Previously , the Ukrainians have twice been world champion of the WBO and WBC .
Unfortunately , with the K.O. , which all the expected , was not a success .
Klitschko has built its record of 39 victories in 41 Profi-Kämpfen , twice he had to take on cases of breaches of human rights .
Johnson's challengers had to fight the first defeat in 24 .
Some 17,000 spectators in the Berne Convention arena , wanted to 2.02 metres great Klitschko fight , above all , with his left .
Of the 11 centimetres smaller Johnson before the end of the klitschko-ära , turned away again and again the blows of the champion was , so that its dangerous Klitschko rights are not crucial to the finishing line .
A total of passive Johnson too little for a challenger and sought only to make ends meet .
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures , its blows met the world champions , but only rarely .
He is , after all , only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000 , with Klitschko on the full distance of 12 rounds .
The challenger before the fight in the Swiss capital , for some .
He has outraged Klitschko as " ugly zombie ' , ' nothing is right " .
The robber was the champion will meet on Friday to do so , Johnson from the nose schubsen ' in order to be able to see his eyes . "
A fourth victory after the Klitschkos comeback
Klitschko also failed in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October , 2008 .
After nearly four years of break he had at the time , the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and " his " WBC-Gürtel zurückgeholt he previously made without a fight .
This year , he held in his Titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba in September and Chris Arreola , from the United States .
I have only one blow in this fight and I am physically very well in the form of Klitschko , the rapid return to the ring .
His dream remains , but the unification of all four major title in the family .
brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF .
The WBA belt , but the Briton David Haye - after that in November the 2.13 metres Nikolai Walujew entthronen .
Haye had earlier in the summer , the planned for next September fight against Vitali Klitschko .
supposedly planning to whose Promotiongesellschaft now the fight against Klitschko in the City of London .
The case of Kunduz
The full frontal attack from the opposition : Grünen-Fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin , Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information to a liar .
SPD and left asking for clarification from the Chancellor .
Hamburg / Berlin - after the recent findings of the air strikes of Kunduz , the opposition defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg ( CSU ) a deliberate deception .
The minister , I have seen deadly bombardment on two Tanklastzüge September " knowingly speaking the truth ' , said Jürgen Trittin Saturday in the ARD-Nachrichtensendung " Tagesschau ' .
That is what is landläufig : he lied .
The order to kill is beneath contempt for the rules of the International Security Assistance Force for Afghanistan ( ISAF ) .
This is the substance of the report , which the NATO , Mr Guttenberg has read , said Trittin .
On Friday it was revealed that the attack is not just a question of the destruction of the kidnapped vices , but also two Talibanführer targeted killing .
At the very least the German colonel Kunduz-Kommandeur small requested US-Luftangriff were up to 142 people were killed or injured .
the SPD and Greens , left on Saturday called for Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) to immediately before the Bundestag to and also to clarify what really did not know about the incident .
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is an integral part of the federal government - and whether the chancellery , army and intelligence service this new strategy approved , Jürgen Trittin and Grünen-Kollegin Renate Künast .
In addition , Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism .
the Kanzleramt did not refer to specific operations of the armed forces in Afghanistan , he said .
On Saturday , there were doubts about the presentation of the ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of Generalinspekteur Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert .
According to the Mirror , the two Guttenberg correctly and fully informed about the background to the Tanklaster-Anschlags informed .
Officially , it was said that you had the existence of the Holocaust and the minister sensitive details .
A source close to the two top officials said , however , that it is the Ministry of Defence even on several reports have pointed out , including a bilateral document befehlhabenden colonel and a small Feldjägerbericht .
It is now in a letter for clarification of the situation , reported the " Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung General . "
He has not received a reply , it says .
The ministry expressed on Saturday is not one of the allegations and pointed out that this is in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag will be clarified , next Wednesday .
Traumwelten
Some people see in wachem state of pictures and hear voices , the others do not see or hear .
Not only the mentally ill and the blurring of the boundaries between imagination and reality .
As long as there is in his sleep , everything is in order .
If we continue with our eyes closed in our dark rooms , we must take whatever decision it's wildest ideas and Phantasiegebilden .
However , those who , in the Wachsein traumartige conditions have seen things and hear , the other not to see and hear , in the modern Western world as crazy or drogensüchtig , at least as a Sonderling .
But such images , and not only in the mentally ill or in Drogenrausch .
Blame our imagination : the same processes that will enable us to houses , paint pictures or to write , in some cases , for the fact that the borders between dream and reality is becoming increasingly blurred .
traumartig modified Wachbewusstseinszustände may be used in a variety of forms , in the best case we call them visions , in the worst case scenario .
Even if the cause and effect are different , the visions of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen , the Drogenerlebnisse of New-Age-Propheten Carlos Castaneda , schamanische Entrückungszustände , psychoses and hallucinations , but similar processes .
hallucinations or delusions , if the balance of neuronalen Botenstoffe of the brain - target the neurotransmitter dopamine , serotonin and Noradrenalin , Acetylcholin - we lose and the interaction of various Gehirnteile .
complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a climate of fear .
The force of gravity has no more about it .
The context of delusion and dream has philosophers and since the ancient times .
Aristotle concept of hallucinations as a form of the dream in that condition , Wilhelm Griesinger , one of the founders of the modern psychiatry , 1861 a " great similarity of Irreseins with Traumzuständen ' for Sigmund Freud was the dream of " a climate of fear , with all the inconsistencies , Wahnbildungen false perceptions , such a ' .
It is the autumn of 2001 , when Henning T. into a Comicfigur .
His body is zweidimensional and quietschbunt .
The force of gravity has no power more about him , and he is the Zimmerdecke .
He senses a .
Behind him geflügelte Teufelsgestalten with blutroten , distorted Fratzen , zähnefletschend .
They hunt him to replace him with serious , boots , throw it against the walls , he feels the pain in the whole body .
noisy , malicious and vote dröhnen from walls and radio .
It can no longer bear to split the vote , who accused him of insulting and insult .
Henning T. reißt two cable from the stereo , they turned out to be a noose and consolidating them snags .
It is rising on a loudspeaker and the noose around the neck .
The maid .
The noose is relaxing .
This should be a lesson to you , the voices in the chorus , " walk in the clinic and let you cure ! "
Today , Henning T. 40 years old , he has six acute psychosis , is the last 2 years , the first in nearly 20 years .
It has been built up by LSD .
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoide psychosis , he is , it takes drugs , against the depression , mania , the schizophrenia .
He has learned to live with his disease for three years , he is married .
In the climate of fear , I fear the worst and deepest despair , he says .
The Trugbilder are cruel reality
Around one per cent of the population suffer from at least once in life with schizophrenia in psychiatric clinics will it as the second most common illness after the Depression .
In a climate of fear can no longer acute schizophrenen affected mostly between internal and outside world , they get trapped in a state of being , hallucinations , sizes - Beziehungs - or Verfolgungswahn can lead .
This is particularly widespread Stimmenhören - vote , comment on , or dialogisieren .
Also optical hallucinations are not rare .
The party was an important can no longer Unwichtigem , the brain can be disturbing signals no longer ausfiltern awareness of by those who were flooded .
As the dream it opens the floodgates for a spate of ideas and imagination , the deeper Bewusstseinsschichten bracket .
The Realitätswahrnehmung in the climate of fear is subjektzentriert , says Professor Thomas Fuchs , the clinic for General Psychiatry in Heidelberg .
The schizophrenic is located in the middle of it , everything has a him .
At the same time , it goes into a passive role , he will be in a similar manner to dream , by what happened and they cannot be active .
schizophrenic feel so often threatened , controlled and manipulated .
A Realitätsabgleich is often not possible to Trugbilder are cruel reality , wake up .
Even in the life of a Halluzination have
Unlike in the dream , says Fox , " remains , but the sinnliche and geographical structure of the reality in the climate of fear , in principle . "
The thoughts and hallucinations were rooted in the reality of the Erlebens will take place in real life .
Exactly why our brain Kapriolen proposes , researchers are still a mystery .
Ausnahmezustände can lead to every person that he loses grip on reality , says Fox .
But not everyone will be a climate of fear .
It seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia , but studies have shown that genes are not the only factors .
Researchers on the assumption that affected minimal brain damage .
We suspect the maturing of the brain at an early stage in the development will be disrupted by the mother during pregnancy , for example , has explained to FOX .
But it is still a mystery , as the disruption of the system , which is , furthermore , first of all , for many years , not manifestiere .
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis if the disposition .
Also halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychosis , in that it would intervene .
If our brain is running hot
The stupidity of this is Psychotiker suffer from hallucinations and swallow their expensive medicines , in order to get rid of them , others are spending money for drugs , what to get , says the Lübecker Psychologieprofessor Erich castes .
Whether Trugbilder as pleasant or unpleasant , it is often only a question of the position .
castes collects for ten years reports of hallucinations and , last year , he has made his results , in the book " the unreal world in our head ' .
hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis , but also by many other illnesses .
These include mental disorders , such as depression or borderline often diseases such as migraine , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis , Alzheimer's disease and or Schädelhirntraumata .
Surprisingly , under certain conditions , even the brain healthy people .
hallucinations , castes , from Gedächtnisinhalten , which normally should not have been .
They arise when Hirnareale where Sinneswahrnehmungen are processed , or too little , and regulations ; if our brains are hot , or even if stimulation .
This state of affairs as well as drugs can cause brain damage or a climate of fear .
But also , stress , or other mental Ausnahmezustände .
More recent studies , there was up to a third of the respondents , at least once in the life of a Halluzination have been defeated .
In the summer of 2005 , Sarah K. 16 years old , she lives in a small town in West Pomerania and visited the gymnasium .
It is a perfectly normal girls , really .
Were it not for the images and voices .
In the break , it can happen that a young boy with long , dark hair there .
If it does , it is no surprise that the Mitschüler - no one else sees or hears these young .
Do you think girls for a versponnene Tagträumerin , but Sarah K. not dreaming , I know you .
It is awake , listening to you and these young girls , just as they have in the bank next to see or hear .
It can even feel his presence , at least for a few moments .
A nice is how it is , and it is the young .
I am crazy ? , asks you sometimes .
But they know that this young and the other Trugbilder not are real , and then disappear again .
At night are the most frightening phenomena
Often , the Trugbilder is also a burden .
If it is , it cannot follow the Unterrichtsstoff sometimes , because the teachers in their eyes and ears on a new set , while he was for all the other and visible from the mathematical equations .
At night , the phenomena are frightening .
If they are in their dark room on sleep is , of course , far too little and much too late , it can often do not distinguish whether you are awake or is already dreaming of , whether the pictures they have the Fratzen or the girls with the blutenden Schnittwunden on arms and legs , before their eyes open or closed .
Let me , in a quiet , crying out for you to make .
parents and friends told him they had no knowledge of them , would you mad .
In the autumn of 2009 . Sarah K. is now 20 years old .
It has in the past year , the baccalaureate and lives with her friend .
A year ago , the hallucinations .
Since the Internet contact with the psychologists castes , she will know that they are not crazy .
It is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or Reizentzug suffers from , he is most likely , after a while , hallucinations , says castes .
I suspect that the brain is then unterbeschäftigt and even for his entertainment .
Sarah K. , a Einzelkind , as a young girl , fear of other children , often , she played alone .
their hallucinations began when they came up with 13 , heard that the man , whom they Papa , since they cannot see their father .
Because , in the case of acoustic and visual hallucinations , the same Hirnbereiche are active , who is also a real impressions and sounds , it affected as Sarah K. difficult to Trugbilder and reality . " every experience , " says castes , " will take place in the brain , the reality is there .
hallucinations are also images of the brain gives rise to , and that is why they are so real . "
Also at night Traumbilder wertet caste as a form of Halluzination .
The hallucinations from healthy do not differ radically from those of acute psychosis .
Unlike schizophrenen are mentally healthy , capable of taking their Trugbilder as unreal .
Kasten also advises his patients , therefore , that the hallucinations as a special ability to wertzuschätzen .
between the dream and Halluzination
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten world will see the imaginary , alas , pathologisiert , says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard , professor in Heidelberg and the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf .
A climate of fear is a serious disease , but it also has a positive , creative madness - is also a work of art from despair .
The so-called oneiroide Erlebnisform researched , a special form of traumartig modified Wachbewusstseins .
oneiroide are hochkomplexe , detailed the Erlebende for real , and it , too , in retrospect , not Wachzustand can be different .
The oneiroide Bewusstseinszustand in trauma - or extreme situations , for example , on which , in full awareness of a motor paralysis .
When a person commits itself - and is threatened by , for example , total Bewegungsunfähigkeit replaced the life-threatening Realsituation by their own imaginary world , from the reality that is decoupled , says .
A kind of Grenzzustand between the dream and Halluzination .
Since the completion of a situation in the reality is not possible , a Weltwechsel , which will , however , in the imagination .
An intensive form of Sinnstiftung and Sinngebung in an intolerable situation , the US people their own destiny , not in a nothing of the Bewusstseinsverlustes going under .
Everything is real , though later in memory .
The art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid-Erlebnisse in his book " Herzwechsel ' as a bailout of the soul .
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a Herzklappenoperation , followed by a Herztransplantation for days on the road , while his body in critical care to Bewegungslosigkeit is doomed to failure .
Claussen , a crucial in a world , visited foreign times and places : he has seen itself as bettlägerigen , old man , on board a Zugsanatoriums , a robot to monitor his health .
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles who sell from blood .
A budget of Greeks on the motorcycle in his own country , with his Spitalbett Firnschnee in the Alps and a Korean Mafioso .
It is completely in the imaginierten , everything is real , though later in memory .
These internal travel to distinguish itself from any dream .
The dream is a different situation , he describes .
Quite the contrary , I feel that the memories of mental journeys after years and in some minor details .
more determination and even as it really is .

Both children , heirs of 27 years and have a strong will to businesses , " said the 69 - year-old to the mirror .
The details , we have , as a precautionary measure .
The question of whether or not they are in companies are active , only after that .
The question also arises as to whether they are capable of working .
You cannot 7500 staff his children if they are not sufficiently willing to take risks .
This brings the children and the company .

The promises FonPeek
Peek is limited , a device , with only his e-mails read without a way to certain annexes to be able to see or surfing the Internet .
It has its five minutes of fame enjoyed than the Time magazine , one of the products of the year .
At the same time , it is clear to see , it is unlikely , but the idea is , nevertheless , especially for young people .
In contrast to the smartphones peek costs very little and has a very favourable , for example , only half the price of a flat rate of an iPhone .
After the success of the company so that has seen , it has two new devices on the market : one that is beneficial for Twitter is supposed to be the other with a life-long Gratisservice for data , in contrast to the Peek , a six times higher price to pay .
FonPeek yesterday at the event in Le Web was presented , is the European version of this invention and thus its third version .
It has the same borders , such as his American counterpart , however , has come as a surprise .
On a monthly basis for the telephone , about 12 million in the month , roaming for the whole of Europe .
Those who with a smartphone in order to travel around the world , already know what it means to all of the data , rocking his emails to be able to read , as soon as the border of over when , or if , after a desperate café with WiFi is seeking ( or a Verbindungsmöglichkeit with Fon ) .
The idea of the roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and it should be possible for a long time .
It is true that some Telefonanbieter already specific contracts and prices for Auslandsaufenthalte offer , but in my experience , you will need a doctorate in physics and a good pair of glasses to read the small print .
The repeated criticism on the part of the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming charges for the whole of Europe remained almost always .
of their own country , we always afraid of his emails to read and rightly so .
The fact that a little as FonPeek ( although it is always amazing is that it is the name of the Fon , even though there is no WiFi / WLAN ) has this kind of tariffs can offer , means that the Telefonanbieter , slowly but surely , and need to start various possibilities to consider how they can use .
Kindle is another good example , in his prices is the illegal downloads of books and other questions on the Internet .
Without Vetrag and without a catch .
It is a internetfähiges equipment and pay only once , namely in terms of purchase , and not every month for a month .
And that is exactly what it is , as I also , one day , I expect a Kaufmöglichkeit with lifelong access to the Internet as the Peek is already in the US .
And this is not because I do not buy it .
I read my emails with the telephone , thank you .
But I expect this , because I am of the opinion that it is a model for the consumer .
It would be interesting to have a computer with the same system to be able to see .
The Fetischfarbe of Michelle
Gelb is , without a doubt , the American first lady .
In the case of the election of Barack Obama as president of the United States appeared in a dress and a coat colour and has the same colour re-elected him in , without doubt , the second most important moment in his life : the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo .
Michelle Obama has two very similar models : that it is almost the same colour - a leading grüngelb - there was the clothes in three parts - dress , a jacket and a coat from the same material - and , to this end , it has been something gesticktes or a Halskette .
It is even went so far as to say that it is the first sight , which seemed to know that the first lady of the United States on the model of the Princess of Asturias consequences and decided to have the same dress on more than one occasion .
However , the two clothes , very much in the Stoffart from which they are produced .
At the inauguration was wearing a dress from the top and in Oslo from gemusterten unraveled .
The Accessoires were different : the first time green shoes with halbhohen paragraphs , and for the second time a model , but goldfarben .
Also's hair every time was different : the hairs were on this occasion as Haarkranz hochgesteckt , previous contributed to the hair .
75 % of working mothers have because of their maternity problems in the work .
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years , especially in the younger women who wish to have children .
This result , which is when the CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women's study " fertility and career women in Spain . "
The survey among women aged between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it : 75 % of working women see their career in the labour market because of their motherhood .
The study suggests that there are differences in the decision to start a family , and the number of children , depending on whether the women to work or not , and if so , what kind of life .
Those of you who do not do any other work of the House , only while work or a fixed contract , is more likely to be mothers and have more children .
By contrast , the women with a fixed rate of employment , especially in the public sector , the creation of a family and motherhood , and that is why we have fewer children .
" The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a fixed employment of their first child , on average , only 3.7 years after Zusammenziehen , a figure that is set to 4.1 years for women with solid employment increased , the longer we needed to achieve this and the Zusammenziehen and the first child until much later .
It also has the kind of work on the motherhood , albeit less than the calendar of events on the Empfängnisbereitschaft , " explains the CSIC-Forscherin Margarita Delgado .
The level of education is another factor in the age of the women in the marriage , and the first child must be taken into account .
According to the survey , the age at the time of the marriage and the first child , the higher the higher level of education .
This difference has also been able to in the women of the same age .
For example , the women in the group aged between 35 and 49 years , depending on whether you only Hauptschulabschluss or a higher education , on average , each with 25.1 or 32.1 , for the first time mother .
There are still , depending on their level of education , a further difference between the women .
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss before its first permanent jobs and their first child , make it the women , with an average or high school leaving examination were exactly the opposite and seek a permanent jobs and marry later and will receive their first child , Delgado .

cowardly aggression
My 70 - year-old mother was last week by our district of the town of Fuenlabrada , when suddenly , a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 years in addition to her and our dog herliefen , our dog is a Mischling we from the closet , and just six kilograms , and then out of the blue he missed two and injured him so difficult .
Our outrage cannot in words , since it is incomprehensible to us , where , since the cost of a cheap Agression against a small and hilfloses animal should be , which is , of course , straining at the leash .
Added to that is the idea that a woman who is comfortable top-ranking , as they are , these people as a result of an incident , it feared , even to their own lives , because if a mad a dog attacked , he will be the same and perhaps also with a woman , a child , an old Mr or probably even with each , weaker than he himself .
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhoods at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary day on Tuesday .
The dog has the whole day .
We have , of course , in a nahgelegenen Polizeidienststelle filed a complaint , we have , however , doubt whether anything will bring and to avoid any prejudice from the outset , we would like to make it clear that only the cowardly criminals Spaniards .
our indignation about what has happened , which led us to this incident .
We cannot understand what is going on in the minds of these young people need to know that you have a cheap attack on a funny animal , an animal that we love , society and friendship .
We do not know where the good education and the respect for the animals and the people .
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has , in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety ( Fesvial ) launched a campaign to promote the Helmgebrauchs , above all in the case of younger motorcyclists launched , as both companies .
This initiative is to recognise the importance of the Helmgebrauchs to draw attention to , because it is , in the end , about the only , or even the death in the event of a Motorradunfalls can prevent .
Michelin has pointed out that this campaign is part of their commitment in terms of road safety , " far more than just the design and manufacture of products with each day will become much more secure " and further reaffirmed that they will continue with other actions to educational and informative nature of contribute to this objective every day to come a step closer .
This new campaign to promote Helmgebrauchs on the motorcycle , which , under the slogan ' be deleted or not to be , in a first phase of posters on more than 500 Motorradwerkstätten , in order to spread .
In conclusion , Michelin has stressed that the road safety " a constant concern " of the company , and it is precisely for the reason that , as they are the manufacturers of tyres for cars is always committed to one of its main objectives of the development of safer products .
The sale of Kleinlastwagen is rising again .
After almost two years begins the Automarkt for Kleintransporter finally shed some light at the end of the dark tunnel .
The vehicles , which in November in Spain were allowed to run , would mean an increase of 12.6 % in relation to the year 2008 , and , what is more important is that they are so that the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months with recession , the ANFAC Herstellerverband and Autohändlerverband Ganvam presented figures .
These good numbers , however , are currently only with caution , because the comparison data become available in November 2008 , which is a particularly bad with a drop of 60 % on the previous year .
However , we must bear in mind that , apart from the rise in the last month , the Gesamtzulassungen 11 months still 40 % below the sales figures of the previous financial year .
Since January , a total of 95,853 vehicles sold in this figure , but all vehicles , from which the Kleintransportermarkt is : descendants of passenger cars , pick-ups , Kleintransporter , small vans and lighter Kleinlastwagen / chassis .
Furthermore , it is still the same storm clouds in the sky , which are the most affected , because , even if some of the vehicles to be bought by individuals , the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises , which are in almost 100 % of all cases of the purchase with a Drittfinanzierung .
This is the way these restrictions , which are the result of the zugedrehten Geldhahns of credit institutions , other factors , such as the increase in the unemployment rate , or the last of the bad economic situation .
In this situation , and , unlike the passenger cars , the financial support towards the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E little help .
This plan is , however , not only for individuals , the self-employed and small businesses have a right , but when it comes to changing up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer , want to buy , but the low sales figures speak for themselves .
Just yesterday , again had to remember that it is part of the state , also needs a special attention to this and , of course , also on the Industriefahrzeuge ( heavy goods vehicles and buses ) .
The Autohändlervereinigung predicted for the year 2010 , a similar year such as this in the past , for which there is a Verkaufsausfall ( with passenger cars and SUVs ) by 19 % .
Support for Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now a duty
As was the case with the ABS and how it is now with the ESP stability control , must be on the brakes in emergency situations in the European cars .
In fact , they have a duty to all newly registered passenger cars and light , for the remaining vehicles , a Karenzfrist until the end of February 2011 .
The European Union has been adopted with the aim of protecting the environment , these funds can , however , because of their operation , helping it to many .
The task is to bring more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical Bremsmanövers system on the basis of the work carried out by the drivers on the brake pedal , .
This system , however , is exerting this pressure not to the end .
According to a statement by the Komponentenhersteller for Bosch-Fahrzeuge commissioned a study , a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the Zusammenstoss is no longer on the brake pedal , and half of them did not have with full force .
Up to 1,100 accidents
The contrast with maximum force in the braking system and reduces the Bremszeit and thus also the Bremsabstand slapped in the face by a car .
According to a study in the EU each year could be up to 1,100 lethal accidents which cause damage to be avoided if all cars with this type of Notbremsassistenten equipped .
It would be even less accidents - it is estimated that one out of every accident involving personal injury prevented - as soon as the so-called intelligent Notbremssysteme popular .
Then there is the vehicle with a system which is ( on radar or a camera ) obstacles and warns the driver , while , at the same time , it is already a slight pressure on the brakes .
If the driver then reacted to him in the system , the pressure on the brake pedal to increase , if needed , would be upheld .
If the driver does not respond to the warning , and even if the Zusammenstoss already is unavoidable , as a result , the maximum pressure on the brakes , in this way , the damage as much as possible .
General Motors has postponed the plan for Opel by January
While the workforce of the Opel-Werks in Figueruelas ( Zaragoza ) by Nick Reilly , the new chairman of General Motors ( GM ) Europe , had been informed that the production of the new Meriva at first Aprilwoche will start , probably on December 8 , according to Javier Ortega , the American car manufacturers that he needs more time to carry out the rescue plan for Opel to a conclusion .
Nick Reilly , the new chief executive of GM Europe , wishes to ensure that the affected side gave their consent to each and every point of the plan in advance .
and , for this reason , can it be that the final document that first of all the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works , will be presented to postpone until the beginning of 2010 .
Will GM be assured that it is in the next few days a decision regarding the sale of Saab .
It is not surprising , then , that the Swedish government pressure on the American Autobauer has increased , so that as soon as possible a decision is made .
GM concedes , with some potential new buyers in contact .
One of these buyers could Geely , Volvo , too , would like to buy up , however , the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper-Sportwagen by the Russian group Converg backing , has always stronger .
If none of these buyers had to reach an agreement , it could trigger some of GM's assets to China's BAIC .
The decision to Saab by the end of this year , if it had not been sold , it will continue to be upheld .
The driver of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
for the development of their latest and very expensive Juwels was used by the engineers , the Boxster S as a base and it really him 80 kilograms , to make things easier , and he is now only 1,275 kg to tip the balance .
So , the first thing you on the automatic aufklappbare roof by a Zeltleinwanddach with manuellem drive has been replaced , so that alone has saved 21 kilo ; thanks to the model used in this , as in the case of the ' disappearance ' of a further 15 ; by the exclusion of the air conditioning again 13 ; one has the Kraftstofftank of 64 to 54 litres in size , have been further 7 kilo saved ; the installation of sporting Bacquet-Sitzen again 12 and with the slight 19 - Zoll-Felgen , another five .
You then had also aggravated by the withdrawal of the Audio-System CDR-30 again six kilo less and through the exchange of Türgriffe by Griffe substance from the lack of kilo .
Although he was also with the PDK is available , the Probefahrt with a vehicle with 6 - gängigen Handgetriebe carried out , mainly on the smaller of California , who really are .
His driving behaviour can only congratulate him on the score .
The reduction of its weight , but that does not mean he is now no longer so sure on the pitch .
Rather , the opposite is the case : since long have we no longer such a small and easy probegefahren model , which is a real but , at the same time , a feeling of safety in the curves , even at high speed .
He is a small enough to be able to flex its muscles in a low set in motion the necessary time to warm to him until we give the orders to the lawn to curb , to recover and then again everything from his engine to get ...
He makes everything he says . the car makes everything we eat with our hands on the steering wheel , thanks to its control , in exactly the same way as is of the essence .
And he did it with the precision of a surgeon .
A Motorsound for all tastes
The sound of his boxers V6 with 320 horsepower ( 10 more than the Boxster S ) is very good and it can increase with the 'sport'-Option and by means of a system that the Motorgeräusche can change , which has already been the Panamera , for the first time .
The missile is brutally , whether from the stand out or renewed .
The Federungen are strong , but not hard or inconvenient .
The asphalt at the point on which we agree with the Boxster Spyder , was quite badly damaged , but the car is the good .
The electronic assistants had the whole length of the almost nothing at all to do ; and , despite the fact that we have some of these curves ice at the crack of dawn and Rollsplitt this morning .
To sum up , we can say that it is a car to drive a car with whom you have an indescribable Fahrspass has , as it is otherwise rather rare and it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss .
The car will be in February 2010 to come on to the market and the euro .

The Baskonia to grab a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated , in spite of the many players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic a magnificent triumph with 82 - 91 during his visit to the complex of the Maccabi Electra and so on the first place in his group after the appearance of Mirza Teletovic with eight times the best in his team was ( 29 in the assessment ) .
The team from Vitoria , the significant remarks by Herrmann , Oleson , Huertas , or by a deep sense of commitment and teamwork , even if they are to the bitter end their wait for victory .
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 , valued at triple wore on her final victory .
The game began with the leadership of the Blauroten right from the start at the top on the agenda .
Since the first four baskets in the team from Vitoria already from the perimeter , it turns out , we have already seen that they have on the pitch with well aufgewärmten Handgelenken .
It was English and , mainly for the 18 - 20 at the end of the first quarter of 1990 .
The second quarter was little different , just like that , the team from álava for a game of Barac decided and for the game of Eliyahu , on his return to the team with Pfiffen and applause , was received in the wake of his home is their advantage further to pause to ( 34 - 43 ) .
already began to emerge as the best of his team with 13 points , including the " minus six " assessment of the mote already guess that this is not the best night of Brasilianers .
Nonetheless , it was the game , despite the clear advantage in the pause is far from decided and the Makkabäer wanted to remind you once again that on the pitch , not everyone wins , and thanks to the " hand of Elías " they came into the game .
And Pnini contributed to ensuring that the " yellow " at the helm umdrehten ( 50 - 49 ) .
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic , injured , but anything other than dead , had a few Spielzüge with Treffsicherheit prepare to return to the air and one of them came all of a sudden the gun by Mirza Teletovic , with three successive almost three times , and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that , on the Anzeigentafel again einberuhigender gap by ( 54 - 67 ) appeared on the screen , which the hosts at the end of the third quarter of with ( 57 - 67 ) .
The last quarter and English and San Emeterio ( 60 - 75 ) has already announced that it would allow no one to tell them the victory that they are in the first minutes honestly deserved , again .
Nevertheless , resignierten Pnini and making the best of their team , and to your team once again by three points from the line ( 70 - 77 ) .
Nevertheless , and despite the splitter because of fouls being sidelined , the team of Ivanovic , defended well and , although the Israelis are still in the last minute aufholten ( 80 - 85 ) , had the game is already a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season .
Injuries prevented Unicaja stood up was

The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the warehouse at the peace and friendship treaty before the opposing team , which may be one of the strongest in Europe and a lot of money .
Thanks to their game in the first quarter of the Andalusian start to dream . an aggresive Verteidung and three consecutive three times , two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio , the hosts with 12 - 18 in the 9th minute .
Olympiacos , the intensity of the Unicaja surprised , even if the local team with a Innenspiel between Bourousis , and it has managed that in the 13th minute , 22 - 20 in their favour , in the final minute , when it is due to a lack of action almost Schlägerei between the two Americans Beverley and Williams would , and would therefore disqualified from both .
The Greek team finally began to warm , and his superiority on both Spielhälften , while the termination of the Englishman , Joel Freeland , owing to a breach and the three self-inflicted mistakes by Carlos Jiménez clear traces of the Unicaja .
Among its players of the Innenfeld and the Lithuanian Vorspieler Linas Kleizas , with his triple , increased their advantage in the 19th minute on a 44 - 32 .

Unicaja tried to find out about the many defaults and the departure of the course of the game injured Scots Robert Archibald .
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja in the 31 minute thanks to the leadership and the triple by Cook and the use of Lewis , a little hope of 66 - 57 .
Nonetheless , it was actually impossible , since the Olympiacos as soon as he and his superiority with centimeters within the Korbbereichs showed not to slow down .
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37 . minute Korbdifferenz on 81 - 62 to rise and Unicaja had to admit defeat and had to take the lead .

After the days since last spring , in which the inflation of the assets , the prevailing mood in the markets was , is , in the markets , the uncertainty returned to what is not surprising , since this is their natural shape , in an environment in which the broker decisions on one of the inherently insecure about the future .
to stabilize the markets , it was to the debt with the Direktkauf of assets and , indirectly , the liquidity for a free hand in interest rates , which is the zero , so that in this way the banks assets to buy .
The central banks have already confirmed that the Direktkäufe of assets as well as to an end and , without their heterodox policy on liquidity into question , to start a spanner in the works , as in the case of BCE näc already vormachte with their Jahresversteigerung next week .
That is why investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy , the economic recovery without these and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums .
The stock market and the differences in the Unternehmensboni rise again , even if it is still a far cry from the paranormalen amounts , which they have at the beginning of the year .
The Member States have been forced to risks to nationalize the private and the public debt will rise again .
We are now back on quality and the United States , Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors , which in turn will lead to an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro zone in Germany .
Spain has until now little from this episode of instability , but then came the standard
On the other hand , is detrimental to a degree of uncertainty , not to the defenders of the moral risk to silence that , once again , were trying to get the leaders of the Weltwirtschaftspolitik awareness , for what they had , since the devastating effects , which include restriction of credit to the loss of jobs , slowed down , they had , in fact , a new day for the Dankesaktion would have .
Nevertheless , suggests that what is going on in Dubai , a Stammeskrieg between Emiren , is the power in the United Arab Emirates and the development of the situation in Greece was also previously forecast .
A government that the public debt , elections and a new government , which are on the same side .
Prodi made it in Italy , Mr Berlusconi and Mr Sócrates in Portugal after Mr Durão Barroso .
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the failure to meet their Auslandszahlungen saves , and therefore a Euro-Mitgliedsland , its commitments , not more .
On the other hand , it is logical that Ecofin , the Greek government has forced it to be transparent and its citizens with regard to the need for an obligation to test the stability of the state funds .
Yes , we are , as expected , in a recent episode of normalisation of risk premiums , after some lending to large sums of money , would now within the expected .
In the case of Spain , you need not worry , as long as the differences of the public debt at the same pace as the European Unternehmensboni .
We should , however , the European institutions , reduce differences , and the Spanish , further dannn would regard this as a Spanish Member of the risk .
The standard
Once again , it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy shares in Spanish , although at the moment , ' be they drive " is the order of the day .

Galán , which is of the opinion that the Gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy , which has just been adopted by the government , in line with what his company has not , in any case , I wanted to do something about this law to say how incentives for the national Kohleverbrauch to create what exactly the opposite of all the political strategies in the fight against climate change .
In his opinion , " in the long term , we clearly on this direction , despite some " individual " , as the chairman of Iberdrola .
Be it as it may , says that as of now , the decisions on the investment , even if , in the long term , should stop because it would take some time and will be a more stable Vergütungsrahmen must be created in order to tackle them .

The last four to get each of 4 million .
The winners earned 9 million , in contrast to the second , the 5.2 million .
So will gain at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income .
Barça , in turn , earned with his victory in the European Supercup in August 2.5 million .
However , in addition to the variable payments , for the 337.8 million .
