A bloodbath American stock 
The US House of Representatives has rejected on Monday a plan to support the financial system, for up to $ 700 billion (nearly 12 trillion Kč) should be spent. 
The legislators ignored the request by President George Bush, to support the plan. 
Bush's view, the plan would regulate the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy. 
The experienced American stocks on Monday a bloodbath, and the major stock indexes recorded the biggest drop in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index fell by nearly 7 %, a similar collapse had he recorded in 1987. 
The index had already fallen before the vote, but barely there were signs that the draft in the House would not go through, the index has experienced a free fall. 
Congress makes concession: US government must inject $ 700 billion in banks. 
The top representatives of the American Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed to a broader form an agreement on a financial assistance for the American financial system. 
This is to be voted on at the beginning of next week. 
The American lawmakers reached in talks on the passage of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance for the American financial system for a total of $ 700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kroner) a breakthrough. 
However, this means no victory. 
The Members of Congress must still negotiate some details of the agreement, before they publish the final version of the law and are able to vote on it. 
The plan to support the financial system is on Monday in the US Congress. 
On Sunday, said the chairman of the Committee on banking and financial services, Barney Frank, the Reuters news agency. 
In the Senate could different information likely to be voted on Wednesday on the plan. 
Economists that should be a message that the plan is adopted, the first significant psychological factor for a revival of the financial markets. 
After that, come to a "disillusion" because of the complex mechanisms, such as the markets could help in practice. 
Paulson: the plan must be effective 
" We have a significant step forward. 
We have our different views on how to look like a package to stabilise the market, " said the agency Bloomberg Democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
Their words could come on Sunday to a final vote. 
Met representatives of the legislators in the night of Sunday, with the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form. 
This provides for a Abkauf unsellable mortgage assets from financial companies, the financial firms in heavy losses and the stability of the entire system at risk. 
" We are on the brink of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and also at the market must be effective. 
You need to continue the Gesundungs plan further, but I think we are on target, " Paulson. 
A signal for Asia business 
The global financial crisis is also evident in the stock markets down sharply. 
According to the words of the Democratic Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach before Sunday in Congress to a final agreement. 
Would that calm investors before shops on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision of Congress could affect business on Monday. 
So far, but is not yet clear when both chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, there is uncertainty about whether the negotiations at the last minute not fail could still a problem. 
The legislators hope that it will be passed in the next few days. 
The law, but a few changes. 
The total amount of aid to the system will be divided into two parts. 
The initial $ 350 billion should be made as quickly as possible, as President George Bush. 
Congress can block but the distribution of the rest of the money when he gave the impression that the programme not fulfilled his role, and in another $ 100 billion, and, later, the final $ 350 billion. 
Bush takes positive progress in negotiations 
The president has in this decision a veto, but the Congress can be outvoted veto. 
Despite these changes, however, is the basic idea of the programme, which was based to obtain finance for the Abkauf bad mortgage-related securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages. 
" We have drawn up everything. 
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, the Senate on Monday, " the Republican Senator Judd Gregg. 
Satisfied with the progress also showed the US President Bush. 
His spokesman, Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with the progress on Saturday and "misjudged the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and our economy to protect." 
Golden restriction Fallschirme 
The chairman of the banking committee of the Senate, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said the lawmakers had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of perks and a timetable for the financing of the plan. 
The new law to restrict the so-called golden Fallschirme for directors of the companies involved in the programme, and set up a committee, which is supposed to fall to the supervision of the fund. 
This is to the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard, and a great deal of progress toward an agreement that works, and for the market and is important for all Americans," Paulson. 
The plan also expects with a help for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage. 
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages, which she buys, with the aim is to reduce the monthly costs for borrowers and to allow them to keep their homes. 
Marek: psychological help 
The proposed plan is the main economists from Patria Finance David Marek a good idea, but the implementation will be very difficult. 
" And that is because you don't know by what mechanism and at what cost the problematic assets are bought. 
That will be crucial, as the financial sector and the government distributes the losses among themselves, " said Marek this week, the server iHNed.cz. 
Whether the plan will now or the beginning of next week, is not Mareks view. 
" It is much more important that the Members of Congress to agree to support the plan, and that it as quickly as possible. 
The psychological importance of the agreement, that there is a passage is at this moment the most important thing, " said Marek. 
Duel on a knife's edge: MP3 players on mobile phones. 
We advise you in your election 
While almost every mobile phone MP3-Dateien can take place, there can be no more phones MP3 player. 
So it is, of course, that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
Even so, there are plenty of reasons why you should be a stand-alone player. 
The election all depends on the kind of use and the ambitions the future owner. 
Sure it is buying hard for home a splendid expensive record player to listen to the latest album from Maxim Turbulenc. 
Once such musical new seem not LPs and qualitative perspective, there is no objective reason for this. 
But you have LPs with kind of rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, dream you probably at least one of them. 
So it is with the music on trips, with komprimierter music, simplified - music in MP3-Format. 
Here, too, there is price and quality categories. 
On the one hand, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player to spend eight thousand kroner, but it will be a hard Pink-Floyd-Fan headphones for 20 kronor from the market. 
Two extremes between where there is for any room. 
The selection is diverse. 
Also the lifespan of the batteries is crucial. 
Some good Music player can take place a lot more than just music, but the mobile phones they create not even hints. 
No modern equipment is so universally, such as the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the Simsen, there can be music and videos, both of which, it has a better, a worse photo apparatus and perhaps can also navigate. 
And if the Smartphons and includes Kommunikatoren has almost a small computer in the bag. 
It is a minor miracle, because no refrigerator grillen and no television. 
But the universality of mobile phones also disadvantages. 
The more functions you use on your cell phone, the more often, however, you will need to nachladen. 
And the music is one of the largest energy omnivores. 
Only a few mobile phones music can longer than ten played 12 hours, mostly it is much less. 
In this respect, Music player (especially the simplest) much more efficient. 
So you should expect in the cheap mobile phones so that they can no longer than a few hours of music. 
If you then and still make a telephone call you buy prefer to safety a loading gear for the office, this also applies to more expensive equipment. 
You MP3-Playern will not have this problem, the less good hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with a time Aufladen. 
Another problem is, if you want to papered over the music on mobile phones. 
Unfortunately, has only a small part of the equipment on a USB-Abschluss, moreover, not every mobile phone directly without special software on a PC. 
Of course, you can directly the music to a storage medium papered over, but only a few cards read equipment without reduction with the tiny memory cards, which are used in mobile phones. 
You Playern need to exceptions (iPod) no specific software. 
They need the machine only about USB-Port with music from your PC to feed. 
Most mobile phones and player even a music library, disorderly after the name of the performers, the title of the Albums, the Genre or, for example, the assessment by users. 
Some devices are only the tree structure of the catalogues, register Explorer, some, like the Windows can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon smart phones with operating system). 
Players are easier to use mobile phones more 
In the selection of a specific piece of equipment you should particularly after the lifespan of the Akkus, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of Klangs and, of course, the Bedien inquire of comfort. 
For music, above all, time and you hear it every day, only briefly, for example, in the trams, then any mobile phone, the MP3-Dateien. 
What really almost every mobile phone. 
They must also not very control what a mobile phone music formats can process or a player. 
MP3, all, and most of the music that you get in this format. 
The format is one of the most popular, and also the most equipment also music played in the WMA-Format. 
Less is customary AAC (a format that use Apple and its iPods). 
Better mobile phones also allow the purchase of online music. 
One need only on mobile Internet the side of a Providers (or any other provider to call), and you can buy a song or album. 
This service may be in for a sufficiently convincing argument for why one should a music phone. 
Unfortunately, the offer of bad providers and limited mostly only on quick radio Hits. 
Prices are not the lowest. 
In general, however, is that it is precisely this kind of sale of music (whether it be through GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in future will dominate the music industry. 
The mobile phone, the majority. 
If you have the inclination to listen to something you forgotten after the mobile phone in the detection equipment, while the players at home. 
There is, however, whether you always headphones, or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung in. 
If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker on almost every mobile phone, but only the least MP3 player. 
The biggest benefit of the music, mobile phones will be for many in the price. 
The cheapest typically cost less than three thousand kroner. 
For three and four thousand kroner get you a very decent Walkman. 
The biggest handicap will be for the majority that are not normal headphones. 
The best and technically ausgereiftesten telephones with a 3,5-mm-Öffnung for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand kroner. 
The advantage of the player, in turn, lies in the slight servicing. 
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity in the servicing with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or, for example, the record player is obvious. 
There is no collision in the form of a mistaken salaried mobile Internet and then exorbitant bill for data transfers. 
What equipment should now 
Also the cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for austauschbare storage media (type M2, microSD u.ä.). 
Even if you are a karte nachkaufen, two thousand kroner. 
But respect. 
The basic models are usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive can also 8-GB-Speicherkarten read. 
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then you use after Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) must then you no more than 1100 kronor on the table. 
You are one of the more ambitious Group's room, you prefer to specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, a number of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have separate Bedien Knöpfe for MP3, and the Bedien comfort is the one MP3-Players. 
Most here is Sony Ericsson, the mobile phones from the series Walkman the same user interface as separately sold MP3 player. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kroner, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long life span Akku (usually 15 hours, maximum of up to 35 hours) you MP3 players the aforementioned manufacturers. 
The first virtual providers are already this year, the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite sophisticated, the Czech providers offer virtually all of the services, as they are from their partners in Western Europe. 
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual providers, forcing the traditional at lower prices. 
Perhaps this will not be long in coming. 
That the Czech mobile phone operators to the most expensive work in Europe, we have often Mobil.cz reported. 
This, incidentally, also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which brought to our attention that the price for a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. 
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation roaming charges it is probably a paradoxical situation - for some customers, the Czech mobile providers SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home. 
How is it that the prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe, are so high? 
The answer is simple, there is no competition, which really is a challenge. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical in the Czech Republic, there are three mobile networks and a Penetration by far more than 100 %. 
The mobile phone providers against grumble about the fact that it is very much at the Czech market competition. 
The often also approves of the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, often in the past, that there is no place in the Czech Republic for a further providers. 
It is likely that a classic providers with its own network no longer has very many opportunities (incidentally, he would probably be hard to find even frequencies). 
But there is still a way - a virtual providers. 
The entry of virtual providers in the mobile phone market brought a sharp price reduction, in which the traditional mobile phone operators had to respond. 
There were even before the entry of such companies such as Tesco, Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in the United Kingdom similar votes as in the Czech Republic. 
But it has shown that there is for such providers place and that they can really be successful. 
Incidentally, it does not take long to find examples. 
In February of this we have reported on the start of the virtual provider mobile King in Poland. 
In just half a year this providers to win more than 100 thousand customers and so for the five largest providers of the country. 
Behind mobile King is the financial group penta, which is in the Czech Republic, among other things, U: fon. 
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can on a much more specific target group. 
To be able to function effectively virtual providers need much less customers than a classic providers. 
They do not need a relatively high costs for construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In the world make the virtual providers usually the Low-Cost firms - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which will, however, often from a less extensive range of services. 
So, for example, provides Tesco Mobile in the United Kingdom SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as the example of mobile shows King in Poland, it can also be quite a good move to bet on a cliché best target group. 
These providers is: specifically to men. 
"Real vote Kerle mobile King - the vendor they like and they can trust," David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile entertainment Company, the company this virtual provider. 
It's hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland in the Czech Republic take root. 
Doubts also press spokesman of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: " the Czech market is relatively small for a segment of the market, at the most virtual providers are based. 
He is also from the point of view of the relatively services saturated. " 
In the Czech Republic chancenlos, my mobile phone providers 
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile providers conquered the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile King. 
" While we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but to see in the Czech Republic, the negotiations not very hopeful. 
There is more to a market of mobile King in other countries, our region, " says in a telephone conversation on Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press spokesperson for the penta financial group. 
Indirectly, they confirmed that the existing mobile phone providers this idea in the Czech Republic are not very sympathetic. 
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything we can to ensure that no potential competitor. 
Their interest in a launch of a virtual mobile provider shows for some time the GTS Novera group that wants to take another step to be a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area firms customers. 
" We have an interest in going to offer our customers not only fixed - but also mobile telecommunications services. 
And the sooner, the better. 
About that possibility we have repeatedly negotiated with all Czech mobile phone providers. 
With some of them, we were able to make progress in negotiations, " the press spokesman Pavel Kaidl group. 
Perhaps now better times. 
No official information reveals that the first virtual providers is perhaps by the end of the year to come. 
So far, but this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. 
" At this moment we are not in the Czech Republic, there is room for a full virtual providers. 
The Czech market compared to other major markets specifics. 
So far, has not yet entity, with a complex and raised serious project in this area, " says in his Mobil.cz Vlastimil explanation for Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2. 
The nature of the Czech market other providers. 
The press T-Mobile spokesperson of Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement of O2 added: "so far we have not yet viable and on both sides favourable project found that it could continue to build". 
And it adds: " in the network of T-Mobile will appear by the end of the year, hardly a virtual providers. 
At this moment, we would already have a concrete offer, so that we can in the short term thinking. " 
Vodafone is its attention more to meet the demands of their own 3G-Lizenz. 
Miroslav Čepický says: " for negotiations with potential virtual providers we are open, particularly in the field division of the costs and infrastructure. 
We see this from the perspective of the customer the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a quick mobile Internet. " 
The competent authorities, with the providers hand in hand 
The actions of the mobile phone operators is easy to understand, another providers would be more competition, this would lead to falling prices and a decline in profits. 
So why should such a competitors entering the market? 
That the providers can draw on the same side when it comes to anything, also the long to-ing and fro-ing to the emergence of U: fon. 
Probably the most powerful push in the direction of ČTÚ was at the time, when U: fon came on the market by society T-Mobile. 
The show also publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ-Webseiten. 
But now it is just U: fon as an argument for why we should not allow a virtual providers. 
Martina Kemrová said: " the competitive environment of the mobile phone market has been strengthened recently, also by entering the market a fourth mobile provider. 
Taking into account the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player in the market itself and, above all, his services high standards ". 
Given this approach, the mobile phone operators, however, surprised the absolute lack of Czech regulatory authorities. 
It is not just about the attitude of the ČTÚ in Czech unfortunately - in contrast to Britain and other advanced countries - does not have the authority to intervene in the economic competition. 
This alone has the power to protect the economic competition (ÚOHS). 
This but referred to his this whole issue very typical stance. 
" The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after it has come to a conclusion of the contract between a mobile providers and a virtual providers about the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
To date, there has been no such contract, because the supply of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional providers, " in his response to our request Kristián Chalupa by the Department of ÚOHS foreign relations. 
Representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a phrase. 
From a authority, which represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one misused his position in the market, this is more a matter of concern. 
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: "abroad, where virtual providers is quite normal work to see that its market entry to a price reduction has contributed to mobile phone services." 
But probably belong to the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and not a price cut to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
It is truly shocking in this case the almost touching line of the three mobile phone operators from their response. 
The question of whether or not it is really just a coincidence, is obvious. 
Just as the same gasoline prices at the petrol station, to make sure only by chance and the result is a hard competition. 
" The authority has discovered no evidence in this case, which suggest that the against the competition act, and thus she has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter. 
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so he has not increased responsibility for his actions in the market. 
The necessary tools for an opening of the mobile phone market for virtual lack suppliers also likely of the regulatory authority for telecommunications, " Chalupa led in his statement. 
The interpretation of a dominant position in the market is one of many controversial areas. 
There are, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTÚ, after the telecommunications, from the point of view of the economic competition is a single market. 
In such a market has, of course, none of the Czech mobile providers a dominant position. 
Some legal experts but offer a different point of view - for entering the market of virtual provider is always needed the approval of the network operator. 
And the mobile phone providers - logically - for its network a monopoly. 
It means that in a certain segment is necessarily a dominant position. 
Even if but not with this reasoning refuses, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three mobile phone operators remarkably similar. 
They show complaints a number of interested parties (including the society GTS Novera) that in negotiations with all the providers in very similar obstacles. 
Buck-passing is on the ČTÚ in the telecommunication services a fairly usually trick the ÚOHS distanced itself from the whole affair. 
This was in a number of similar cases. 
Unfortunately, it is not managed, in the recently passed amendment of the telecommunications law, the enlargement of the powers of the ČTÚ to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts from an improvement in the situation had promised. 
The representatives of the ÚOHS know only too well, but they probably have other interests. 
It is, when no one look 
Overlooked remains once the functioning of any pseudo virtual providers, of which there are in the Czech mobile networks several. 
There are companies that own price lists for mobile telecommunications services are only partly public. 
Usually it is firms operating in the area Multilevel-Marketing. 
Its own offer mobile phone services, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Star Life and others. 
The price lists of these firms normally only to select. 
The joke of the matter is that the firm against the operators than classical firms customer, a large amount of SIM cards. 
As an important customer receives it special price offers (and other offers). 
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile providers a similar ban resale. 
"There should be cases you describe, then it can be a violation of the act contractual conditions, with which we are dealing, which could lead to a cessation of cooperation with the society," said Martina Kemrová on our question on this problem. 
But it is unlikely that such a thing with the leaders of the mobile phone operators is not around. 
Particularly in the case of the three firms mentioned it can act of thousands of customers. 
No operator resisted, however, that such an approach. 
Flowing from the activity of these firms them not inconsiderable profits, they are at the same time - in contrast to the actual virtual suppliers - will not be affected by the real official marketing. 
On makes possible problems Miroslav Čepický attention: " the law allows these types of speculation, in spite of everything, used the services of these firms have only a very small percentage of customers. 
They also have to accept that the SIM-Karte in her phone is not on their behalf, so they can't fully about as ordinary customers mobile providers. " 
Alone, but they ought to at least the ČTÚ strange. 
Also opened up a further question for the ÚOHS. 
Close the mobile providers before such an approach the eyes why they block a virtual providers? 
It is to add to that the ÚOHS detecting such activities has very strong powers, and if it does not want to ban, it must not be the statement of the providers, they know nothing of them and their business conditions would be satisfied. 
When the Czech Republic is no longer on the most expensive 
As the text has already been a number of occasions, the market virtual providers a sharp decline in price in the various services. 
Have virtually in all countries, where virtual providers are the traditional providers to try to prevent the emergence of virtually more or less. 
They used arguments were virtually identical - a too small, or too much gesättigter market, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
In advanced countries but picked up the regulatory agencies in these moments, which is by no means the interests of the mobile phone operators, but tried to maintain their customers. 
It was followed by formal or informal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operators, and this further. 
Unfortunately, the Czech throw the whole case, regulatory bodies like a hot potato. 
Based on our experience we cannot get rid of that lack of clarity in the competence in these cases, is more than good. 
But we do not throw in the towel. 
If the Czech mobile market background information and soon a virtual providers, will soon, perhaps moving again. 
If a supply the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, this will not stand idly by ÚOHS when it comes to discriminate against other interested parties to reject (). 
And the Czechs are finally no more phones more expensive than the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.

"A passenger to check the validity of the aufgespielten coupons, nothing is simpler than the driver to ask this information," Drápal. 
A passenger, not end with suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupons, in turn, can go to the self-service machines, where the coupons will be up to the card. 
The information on the validity of its documents on the display of the piece of equipment. 
The Sudeten demanded a referendum by the US 
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans had requested the incorporation of the Böhmerwaldes to the United States. 
This is from a letter, which is in the collections of the Südböhmischen scientific library. 
If we can be part of Germany and Austria, so we want to at least under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With such a desire to 1945, a few groups of Sudeten Germans have turned to the president of the United States. 
This is, among other things, a letter, which has remained in a private archive and in the collections of the scientific Südböhmischen kept library. 
The Germans of Krumau ask in the letter the American president, he would not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler was taken over - to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have correctly understood the situation, and we really want to enter the words to be sure that the American units not oppressors and enemies German territory, but as liberators," it says in a letter, with the words "people, which is the fate of the Sudeten on herzen" is signed. 
Since the aftermath of Czechoslovakia the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - suggests that they expect brutality, reckless, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery would ask the author of the letter to the American president, for today and forever on the protection to rule on the Böhmerwald. 
"We can't believe that you without regard to the view that a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area for us foreign state, oppressed minorities and trying to eliminate and absolutely nothing has contributed to the victory for the Allies," read the letter. 
The reason why the authors can't sign is supposedly fear revenge cut-price "Czech oppressors." 
If the US president doubts as to the ethos of the German Böhmerwald have, whether it be sufficient, if he initiate would Böhmerwaldgau a referendum on whether the inhabitants are part of the United States or wanted to live under the protection of domination of the United States. 
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of the post-war history may sound a little naïve, but he considers some time witnesses a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans. 
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to at least anticipated that we would be negotiating over their deportation from the Republic, few of them such a possibility at all. 
Some waited for the United States and Britain for the Sudeten would negotiate a kind of autonomy. 
Still others believed they could stay in Czechoslovakia. 
The also confirmed the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa from Budweis. 
It was used in the war as a Budweiser German in the navy in the Baltic Sea. 
When he came at the end of the war in British captivity and placed him in a prisoner of war camp after Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans to him that he should teach them Czech. 
"They believed when they come home, they would be adding the Czech to come," Chalupa. 
No one of the German prisoners of war, lived prior to the war in Czechoslovakia had been expected, in his view, that he would be on the basis of Beneš-Dekrete from the Republic. 
Du denkst not - then pay! 
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers 
Most expensive action to safety on the roads in the Czech history. 
So could characterize emotional media campaign, which the Department of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday. 
The ministers Aleš Řebíček Authority is to dissuade drivers of dangerous behavior behind the wheel. 
The campaign for 150 million kroner will be on television, radio, in the cinema, on the Internet, but also on Flyern. 
It is to stop drivers to faster driving and alcohol. 
And they also remind before taking journey anzugurten. 
The campaign wants especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers talk. 
And what is shown in the advertising spots? 
Above all, stories of people who appeal to emotions. 
Evidence of the "bloody" slogan throughout the campaign. 
Du denkst not - then pay! 
The words "denkst not" in big letters on a hallmark shield. 
And in a blood laugh is the word "am paying." 
This should mean that you can pay for a moment Unaufmerksamkeit with their own lives. 
The advertising spots will viewers by 2010 "schocken." 
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries where normal images with can see dramatic photographs of accident victims. 
It promises that the accident rate falls and the number of deaths on the Czech roads. 
The advertising spots were put together by the agency Euro RSCG. 
Carrots and sticks for the drivers 
" For the drivers is the motto carrots and sticks. 
Carrot means that, if they drive, for example, in red, save time. 
The stick is the threat of sanctions or an accident. 
The driver must be reminded of the risk, " the transport psychologist the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán. 
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all necessary negative advertising, says the psychologist. 
Are less effective in his view, billboards, drivers on a danger. 
"It is a static table, which warns of a risk that this will probably soon verfließen with the environment, and drivers, they will no longer perform," says Kořán. 
Olmert would almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace to return 
The chairman of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, has called for the return of practically all territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if we could, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria. 
He stressed that in an interview, which was on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot printed. 
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary, almost all (occupied) returning areas, if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper. 
"We keep a percentage of these areas, but we are going to cede to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory), because there will be no peace without it," he added. 
He acknowledged that a possible return also would include East Jerusalem. 
"The person who, security in Jerusalem wants to and, above all, do not want tractors or bulldozers on a plate on his feet, as it happens, is one of my best friends, will have to forgo a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people are killed and dozens of people were injured. 
After words of the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "solution to the Tempelbern and sacred and historical sites," which are on the territory of the Old Town. 
" Those who want to maintain the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city, will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs. 
It will not work, " he confirmed. 
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
Olmert spoke to Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which is, in his view, a condition for the signing of a peace treaty with Syria. 
This would but also some require effort on the part of Damascus. 
"My proposal is not with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights to make peace," Olmert reiterated. 
" The Syrians know only too well what they have to give back the Golan Heights. 
They are on their current relationship with the need to give Iran ; they are on their relationship with the (Shiite) must give Hezbollah movement ; they must renounce the constant support they give terrorism (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terror network Al-Khaida and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq, " the Prime Minister was set. 
Questions about the accident: Stewards are illegal in the bus? 
The law knows it is not, in a television coach the way not allowed 
In connection with the tragic accident involving a bus society student Agency in the vicinity of the Italian Padua, there is the question of whether Stewards and travelers during the journey on a bus and running. 
"We wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, it is the work of a Stewards contrary to the law on road transport," the spokesman for the Transport Ministry Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in the last week, a young Stewardess died, was probably caused by the drivers of trucks, the kreuzte the bus the path. 
The young woman sat in this moment it all in addition to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, even if they had two more seats available. 
A bus but can also be the moment to have an accident or slow down sharply, in which the Steward austrägt coffee or newspapers. 
Playing a role, too, whether the bus the vehicle letter also equipped with Stehplätzen. 
If this is not on the bus, which must sit travellers. 
The long-distance coaches of student Agency have no Stehplätze ; what the director of the firm, Radim Jančura, compared with Aktuálně.cz confirmed. 
" We have discussed with the Treasury, and this was the first to the movement of passengers. 
Later, this has withdrawn, and we have come to a consensus that the passengers during the journey to go the toilet when they have their seat, " he shared with his position. 
The law makes no Steward 
" There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a Stewards - no legislation describes this role. 
But there are also no law, which prohibits the carriers to provide services. 
The law on road transport only knows the concept vehicle companions ; defines rights and responsibilities, but it is not, " adds the spokesman of the Ministry Hanzelka clearly. 
The director of the section of the road vehicles to transport ministry Josef Pokorný says, however, that the law after covering this issue. 
" It is important, whether the bus in the product approval has also Stehplätze. 
This is all, " he stressed. 
Buses are divided between city buses, where there is Stehplätze and the maximum speed is limited transportation buses with Stehplätzen and a higher permitted speed and distance coaches without Stehplätze with the highest permitted speed and seats, which are equipped with seat belts. 
As the plane, says the expert 
Road safety BESIP-Fachmann for Jaroslav Hořín sees the movement of Stewards on board a bus no fundamental problem. 
" In a liquid driving not threaten many dangers, the situation is comparable with the service on board an aircraft. 
Here, too, is not sure when turmoil, and the Stewardess can. " 
" However, slows down a bus, then, of course, also apply the laws of physics. 
Just as in the Stadtbus or in a tram. 
The safety of the Stewards must sort out the carrier through internal rules, " he says and thinks that this issue from the perspective of the law will not be fully resolved. 
Jančura is ready to cut services 
Student Agency offers the only Busfirma services of Stewards. 
The company employs about two hundred people in this role. 
The director also provides their profession following the accident, not an appropriate risk. 
" But when I get the impression that the profession of Stewards risk is appropriate, I will remove it. 
Coffee and newspapers travellers at the boarding. 
This would also reduce the cost, " he says. 
As interest in the safety of the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin has engaged in the absence of Stewards in his buses. His company but only a fraction of lines compared with student Agency. 
" We have no Stewardessen, we are from the outset. 
Sooner or later it ends with a fatal accident, " he had not quite a year ago, for Týden.cz. 
That was an incredible tragedy 
The accident involving a lines bus after Naples was a young Stewardess reel from the region Pilsen, for two years, had worked for the society. 
The Slovenian truck was probably without blinken abgebogen of the state to touch and had blocked the bus trip. 
The driver of the bus tried by a strong manoeuvres to avoid kollidierte, however, with the right front part with the lorry. 
That the two places have been sold for the Stewards are Jančura denies. 
"These places can not be reserved television connections, they are blocked." 
The company wants to sue lorry drivers. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency will not wait for the court's ruling, expected to be a financial damages but also from the culprits. 
A change in the law? 
Not in sight 
A more precise regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring a legal settlement, in which a dreißigköpfiges experts team of transport ministry is already working for a year. 
" But this is still no concrete concluded. 
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones in the journey, " expert Hořín. 
"The Department of Transport is not the work of the Stewards as something that could threaten the safety of passengers much," Hanzelka, with the control of the security of the buses in the competence of the police and the protection of labor authorities. 
Düsseldorfer hope lies in Frankfurt 
The lack of big words in the letter to the board of WestLB not to the staff of the House. 
Through a combination of units of the Düsseldorfer money Institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank could emerge, " the central capital market House of " l financial group, " it says in the letter on Monday. 
The WestLB would provide a "competence bloc" with sustainable profitability in such a deal. 
And could be such a link the key impetus to further Bündelungen in the country's banking sector. 
It reads like a Board at a difficult time wants to demonstrate ability to act. 
Because the wounded WestLB remains under massive pressure. 
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for financial services regulation of North Rhine Westphalia country's government has only recently made clear to urge the time to find a sustainable solution. 
Of a sort of link between the Deka-Bank, " l know customers because of their investments fund and the WestLB is, however, for some time speech to Frankfurt. 
He has Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas during the presentation of the six-month figures at the end of August to know in a merger of the House in the Mainzer country road with a country Bank, for example, the Helaba or, see no sense. 
But the Board of the Deka, half of the country's banks and savings banks associations, instructed the board to lead with the WestLB talks on common business activities. 
It could go to the capital markets business or parts of it. 
The talks have said in the financial, only just begun. 
By the Deka-Bank matters with their 3000 staff, the more important employers on financial centre Frankfurt, is not the first time, when it comes to consolidation in the " l sector. 
In 2003 it looked for a moment as the Deka-Bank with the country's bank Rhénanie-Palatinat merge and Helaba. 
From this tripartite Confederation, however, was nothing. 
The plans were publicly the Hessische national government against a participation of Helaba in. 
The two other houses next, not each other. 
The country's bank Rhénanie-Palatinat was, instead, to the country Baden-Würtemberg Bank in Stuttgart. 
But it has repeatedly thought games on a link to the Deka-Bank with the country's banks. 
Recently, however, had Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba against plan games on a with his house. 
Regardless of but seems to mature the realization that a focus of the various houses of the public sector. 
Now, after the Land election in Bavaria is over, could begin a link the BayernLB with the Baden-Württemberg Bank closer. 
For the Helaba is not necessarily good news. 
Should increase the pressure on other mergers, go to her and the partners. 
In the south, it would be flowing junior partner, even though they were the financial crisis so far, far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A go with the West LB, in turn, has the cash savings and current Association Hesse Thuringia, with 85 percent involved in Helaba is the beginning of the year. 
If the North LB. 
Such geo-strategic considerations but are only one side. 
On the other there is the question of how different business models of individual houses suited to each other. 
In June, said Merl, the crucial question with which business model the future ability of the country's banks should be secured by the German savings banks - and current Association has not been answered. 
In the end, may also be a disassembly of West LB, but there is, of course, do not want one. 
Such is the letter of its board of directors of the speech, it would in any case, a "global solution" to the House. 
As with the individual units with the Deka-Bank can be accommodated, will show. 
The second is Wiesnwochenende as "Italians weekend" 
For Elena, it is the first for Luca the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena as his girlfriend, and everything is different, he says. 
Behind them, the Fünf-Liter-Bierfass the emperor brand, is a massive gebauter Bärtiger and proves the approximately 200 Oktoberfest-Reisenden how deep tones can bring his throat. 
Elena Luca is only a smack, then a kiss. 
From Bologna, they are to Verona. 
From here, the Busparkplatz next to the train station Puorta Nuova, launch this evening at 11.45 p.m. four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" arrival expected 6 point 30. 
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, traveling in a bus exclusively Brazilians. 
In a corner of the park job sing the South Americans, along with their flag, celebrated in the night. 
And so, according to Marco Guarda say that is nothing for Italians. 
Marco, a long cloak with Pelzimitatfutter and a lens with broad silver bars include the buses. 
For five years, they have to travel in October, three are swing this year alone. 
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, at 10.30 p.m.. 
Spend the night would mean only unnecessary expenses, Marco says. 
75 euros costs, the Kaiser Willkommensumtrunk with beer, brewed according to the Bavarian purity, health insurance and the German travel management - Marco has visited in Frankfurt, a language Kursus - including. 
And the buses in the night, on the car Strada direction "Brennero." 
There is no beer, not yet. 
Soon there will be quiet in the bus passengers sleep. 
Well, they are still need their forces. 
Will be held in Brixen and wooden churches, where many other buses with Italian markings on the motorway 8 shortly before Munich once again to take a break. 
As a group, Marcos finally schedule half 7.00 a.m. in the morning in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese matters are already in the 50 other buses from across Europe. 
Elena, Luca and the other to gather, Marco keeps a final speech, declared the plan of attack. 
First, to be worn the yellow Käppchen. 
To the left is "October" in Fraktur alongside the Internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it." 
Second: "when the doors open for the beer tent, it is run," Marco calls in the morning. 
"Go!" and fill the seats at the back of the Zelts. 
"Not ahead, otherwise we block and not all yellow peaked caps on the same benches, distributed in the room!" 
The measure, Marco brüllt, regardless of 8.25 euro. 
And drinking not forget money. 
" The security show people that we behave well! 
Once the verlasst places they are away! " 
Third: "tonight half point 11 arrive here!"? 
And it is Wiesn. 
Driving a yellow bind a complete ban as milestones of the trees, signs and even to the election poster of a great Bavarian People's Party. 
You want to be prepared for the withdrawal. 
It is the second Wiesnwochenende as "known to Italians weekend." 
There is no precise data on figures ; the speech is 50 36000 on the way over the Alps and invade the beer tents, 10 % of all visitors should be this weekend separately from Italy. 
The Munich police reinforced by seven policemen from the South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bayerische Red Cross, which leads a Nations statistics, in which Italians before British (approximately 60 operations) and Austrians (approximately 80) with some 200 medical Versorgungen first place. 
Especially popular with Italians is the Hofbräuzelt. 
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, said federal finance minister, Peer Steinbrück only in the last week. 
As well, that the politicians of the word "relatively" used and einflocht that the German banking sector by the crisis will not spared developments. 
Because the is now at the weekend. 
The quoted on the Dax Munich real estate funding Hypo Real Estate (HRE) by a consortium of German banks a billion credit to shield themselves from the turbulence in the markets. 
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday, the credit aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros. 
The Hypo Real Estate only verzinsen the part they claim. 
The money come from both private and public banks. 
Background losses in the subsidiary Depfa. 
The state funding had according to a newspaper report for Langfristprojekte, for which he has lent money extremely refinanced in the short term - because of distrust in the markets is now no longer possible. 
In the first half of 2008 was the Barreserve the Bank by 95 percent decreased to 2.37 million euros, including the capital rate had fallen to easy 1.6 on 1.45 per cent. 
The current yields and the net proceeds from financial transactions were compared with the period last year to zero, the proceeds of Zuschreibungen to demands and certain securities, and the dissolution of reserves in lending business by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros have declined. 
It was only thanks to higher revenues from refunds of downstream transfer costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the reimbursement of interest rates after the levies order and out of the business Besorgung for corporate business, which had revenue minus with approximately 16 % still moderate. 
The former state funding had verspekuliert following its privatization in 1990 with commercial real estate loans, which were then Aareal Bank being dismantled. 
Because, in the classic state financing earned too little had Depfa then stepped up in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects involved private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. 
On the value of the daughter must be Hypo Real Estate now depreciation, a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group have it quite hot indeterminate. 
The fact is that the dividend was removed. 
For 2007, it was cut by two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate since the Depfa takeover of an important state and infrastructure funding. 
It is more than other institutions dependent on the refinancing in the interbank market, since it has no customer deposits. 
With the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, is lending among banks largely dried up, because the banks are hoarding liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - roughly 50 billion euros - the credit portfolios Depfa short-term funds to refinancing. 
After the communication Hypo Real Estate, which is financing requirements of the group met with the credit for the foreseeable future, and the company "from the influence of the now largely incapable of operating protected international money markets." 
From other sources is to hear that, thanks to the money the refinancing by the end of 2009. 
The HRE-Vorstandsvorsitzende said Georg spark, by contrast, that the Hypo Real Estate Group, the money markets in the foreseeable future will no longer have to take. 
Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for financial services regulation (BaFin) that the market, Hypo Real Estate group now is assured. 
This is to be hoped shareholders and creditors of the Bank. 
But given the momentum and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty. 
It is even possible that the funding needs to be fully. 
But the opposite is not auszuschleißen. 
After late on Sunday night reportedly was the bank before the insolvency, can at least not temporary rescue minds at ease. 
The stock price collapse by 75 % to 3.30 Euro. 
Law well against bond prices. 
While the priority debts hardly budged show prices give clearer accorded a lower priority bonds. 
Particularly affected are the bonds of the former subsidiary Baden-Württemberg Hypo and understandably beyond 2009, which previous periods of time. 
Hypo-Real-Estate-Anleihen seem formerly a speculative investment alternative, whose Werthaltigkeit after the sharp tightening of the banking crisis and the Institute itself, with the takeover of Depfa, the only crisis had brought into the house, than to depend on the stability of the international financial system. 
As long as the central banks, governments and less depressed commercial banks to support of the system are still willing, as long as can be expected from a punctually eradication of pensions. 
Or it occurs, which currently hardly anyone dares to hope that the financial crisis will overcome in the next 15 months. 
But with the partial nationalization is one after reports from the likelihood of security bordering currently only become a legitimate hope. 
This is especially long-term creditors some sleepless nights with the decision as to whether they should be separated from their commitment. 
Short-term investors can use an end to form a loss lecture for the future Abgeltungs tax payments on profits later years. 
Sylvana and the secrets of Bento-Box 
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of school at Tachibana High School is to imagine, the girls are beginning to kichern: Deutsche is totally "kawaii"! 
What does this mean? 
Sylvana knows the word from Mangas - in the new Austausch-Log told them from Japan. 
" The first day of school in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Even before the Schulweg I had Bammel. 
I live on the edge Tokios toward Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School. 
The way I had to find alone, fortunately, I did not. 
The classroom seems to start at the Tachibana not as strict as at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils trudeln from 8.00 a.m. until 20 a brief Besprechungs round nine starts with the teachers ' home room '. 
But before the study began to imagine that I was in the series. 
I am not the type who likes to speak before people, a class of 40 pupils. 
Because I have not had school uniform, I have an old rock attracted my host mother, blouse, blue Knies assets and black leather shoes. 
I lift, I have so the desk and try right: ' Sayonara where she Sylvana... ' - hot Sylvana, come from Germany, and in a week of birthday. 
At the moment, I was very happy that I had a little over two years, starting to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the classes have all getuschelt, sniggering and gewunken and all the time I heard the word "Kawaii." 
I knew that from my Mangas. 
It is important for the survival of Japanese vocabulary girls and means ' niedlich, sweet '. 
I am gehuscht quickly at my place. 
The girl has beside me fairly broad gegrinst, they thought it was an honour that the exchange schoolgirl should sit beside her. 
The rest of the day was fairly calm, but when the chorus Gong, I was bombarded. 
All talked and kicherten and I asked holes in the stomach - it is really difficult to understand Japanese English. 
In the break packten then all of their Bentos. 
My host mother had also made a lunchbox - that is something other than the tedious German breaks Brote. 
I had rice with herbs, small Würstchen, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofu coat. 
Mostly, I have not got a clue what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
Things look strange and taste quite novel. 
What is clear is that everything is genuine lecker. 
Well, until the salzig imaginary plums perhaps brrrr! 
The Bentos are not only easy to Japanese schools, lunch. 
Sometimes it is that a girl a young pays a plate of Bento, which they herrichtet particularly art - in the hope of the young in the Pausensnack closer to know. 
I have read in my Manga-Comics. 
I 'm curious whether I can watch it here. 
' Why because very Japan? " my friend asked me, when I told them that I want to go for a year in Tokyo to school. 
I have always said. 
"Because it is, alas, fascinated." 
Finally, I read for years like Mangas. 
And I understand the comics, and the culture better, I have also begun at some point, a bit Japaneseness to learn. 
For me, was so clear that, at some point I had to travel here. 
Because I have a Faible for tradition and customs. 
And on this great value. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - it is strictly on the other hand, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well organised, I have also not yet lost felt, even if Tokyo is the greatest city I have ever seen. " 
Even rats have feelings 
A rat or a fleeing Schabe in danger this means that it also feels fear? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: much animals have feelings. 
Just how to check whether they feel the same if it is similar to how we behave? 
In the Internet magazine Edge " will be published for several years, contributions famous scientists. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE presented in a series of selected answers to the question, "what do you think, without being able to demonstrate"? 
I believe that animals sentiments and others have awareness conditions without that I or anyone else could prove it so far, where we can't even prove that other human consciousness. 
In this case, but we must hope, at least, because all human brains are the same basic configuration. 
But once we turn to other species, and questions of sense or, more generally, raise awareness, we are entering impassable terrain, because the hardware is not true. 
If a rat is at risk, it is doing the same thing as many other animals: she is dead, retreats or attacks. 
People behave similarly, suggesting some scientists to conclude a comparable subjective experience. 
I do not believe, however. 
Two aspects of the brain structure make it hard to give our subjective experience on the animals. 
For one thing, the almost always on human consciousness associated circuits the roadside prefrontal cortex (because of his participation in the short-term memory and the implementation / control functions). 
This broad region is in humans evolved much higher than in the rest of the primates and seems entirely on other creatures. 
At least for those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge to choose who we are, and the ability to plan and so there is reason to believe that the man even different from the other primates. 
Another dramatic nature may lie in the linguistic human nature: because so much of its Erlebens is associated with language, it is often the awareness links. 
In this case, it could exclude animals. 
But even if consciousness not by language, then this would certainly influence so that animal awareness, as it may be, probably the most of our awareness of Being unterschiede conditions. 
That is why it is difficult to determine how awareness may look for other animals. 
If it is something Internes and Subjektives, either measure because of the specific hardware analyze from our own experience, his research presents us with major problems. 
Most of my speeches are related to the content of the deliberate Erlebens, but there is also another aspect of the awareness, scientific and be more easily accessible. 
You could examine the awareness processes of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what is happening in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the case of visualize. 
But this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick carrying more moved on the neural Korrelate of consciousness than the causal mechanism: both may be identical or not. 
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex to reach the visualize. 
What follows now for the sentiments? 
I put them back on an emotive system as the fear in one of his own conscious brain activity is activated. 
What we call a "fear", so is the mental state of affairs in which we find ourselves if the activity in the brain lokalisierten defence system (or whose consequences, such as physical reactions) working memory. 
So the sentiments are intimately linked to the regions of the cortex, the primates, and especially the people. 
Coupled with the linguistic nature are fine graduations of it, because we can with the help of the words and grammar conditions and differentiate categorise them alongside ourselves also attributable to others. 
By contrast, for example, says Antonio Damasio that sentiments from low-level activities in the Körpergefühlsregionen of the cortex and the brain tribal emerge similar Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain stem. 
As this network in the course of human evolution have not changed much, it could well be involved in semi-generic overarching sentiments. 
Purely in theory, I could not disagree with me, but I think it is unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues, which appear in rats and people like fear, probably in two cases: but, as you can check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave in the same way? 
A fleeing Schabe in danger if they, too, feels fear? 
In my view, can prove just behavior similarity not yet Erlebens equality. 
The neurale helps comparison: rats and humans have similar brain tribes, Schaben, by contrast, is not even a brain. 
But the brain stem is responsible for feelings? 
And even if you could show for people: how to prove in rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), have feelings. 
But I do not know how I should prove it. 
And because their sentiments probably fundamentally from our different (since the human consciousness on specific levers circles, and is based on language), I would rather erforsche the emotional behavior than the emotional sentiments of rats. 
In any case, this is progress on the neural level, to the extent that in rats and people of the same. 
As I erforsche language and awareness in rats, not sentiments, but I do not know whether they exist. 
You may think this is short-sighted to run, but I would rather than constantly against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist.

Dark matter affecting air space probes 
For years, a mysteriöses phenomenon in Forschen for confusion: dark matter influenced the speed of space probes during so-called Swing-by-Manöver. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein's could not be quite right. 
Almost 18 years flying the space probe "Ulysses" through the space. 
Its because soon gefrierenden fuel pipelines now threatens the Kältetod. 
Under provides scientists for years mysteriöses phenomenon for confusion - the Swing-by-Anomalie. 
The Swing-by is a flying maneuvers of space probes, which they added momentum in the Gravitationsfeld a sky body, around the world. 
The probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The European American research probe Cassini-Huygens used these physical trick, as well as the solar probe Ulysses. 
What the researchers, however, for years, surprise: the missiles are not totally, as one would expect from the ancient Gravitationsgesetz. 
Instead, it comes to irregularities in the speed. 
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower. 
So far, the physicists could not explain this effect. 
It tauften Swing-by-Anomalie. 
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein's, which describes the attraction of matter by a curvature of the area, could not be quite right. 
The American physicist Stephen eagle of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton believes still firmly that Einstein was wrong, and tried to explain the Swing-by-Anomalie with the help of the so-called dark matter, the astronomers have identified in the universe. 
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be in the vicinity of the Earth," he writes. 
Aware of the existence of dark matter space researchers have only been around for some 10 years. 
It is obviously a appeal, whose effect on other heaven's body. 
They themselves on the other hand, is entirely invisible, that is, they will send and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially also no visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists is the dark matter, after all, about a fifth of the total mass of the universe.

Obscure street in town to sell often forgotten and possibly soon 
New York City has thousands of main roads Alleen, roads and other ring roads, which some famous and others are only comfortable. 
Yet it is even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing local difficult to say where extra Place, simply because most have never heard of it. 
This tiny street is in the East Village and is from the First Street north between the Bowery and Second Avenue to achieve without the Second Street. 
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alleyway when, after a actively used transit route. 
There is also no road signs. 
It is virtually impossible to find on a Standard-Straßenplan. 
This road still has its admirer. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company, which has recently luxuriöse buildings on the First Street. 
It wants extra pflastern Place, in order to create a clean passage to the shops and Boutiquen in new buildings be expected. 
On the other Verehrern is the long-standing neighborhood, says she was fascinated by the short alleyway, simply because it is one of the vestiges of the past housing blocks. 
But the city government department, which is responsible for protection and the establishment of the residential buildings, and is responsible for the streets to preserve has no interest in them. 
During a meeting of the committee for use of the City Council this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay drew up a proposal for the purchase of the street by the construction company. 
However, the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan, which is to be presented next month, Susan Stetzer, the responsible district on the town council 3. 
"Very little space is in possession of the city and we want to that extra continue to Place is one of the city," she said. 
"There could be bids, how to repair the streets and has engaged in what could be done by Avalon, but we also want the public access is guaranteed." 
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago, the newly pflastern small streets and set up seats, among other things, are meant for a Café, would like to rent out the company. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the streets has been made public for the first time during the meeting this month. 
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but they do not have. 
"The main concern of the Avalon Bay is to renovate the dilapidated alleyway, and to make a public meeting point," she said, and added that the city itself had proposed the sale. 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman said the department for buildings protection, indeed, it was the desire of the city, to sell the streets and stressed the role of the department that it is more likely to develop the real estate than to administer. 
Compared with its diverse neighborhood The Bowery, extra Place has maintained something of its historical impression. 
Some believe that the road to get her name in 1802 has divided than a large Farm, Philip Minthorne was among his numerous children and a close swath of land by any claims. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the Punkrockdenkmals, which was closed in 2006, was opened to the extra Place, and the road is the most known as the scene of the photograph on the Cover of the days Albums "to Russia" of Ramones. 
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, the photograph had made in November 1976. 
The street was full of junk, Lumpen and parts of barrels, Postern, leaves and ropes. 
Some residents, einschliesslich the bloggers who write about the Gentrifizierung of the East Village, have rejected the idea of the sale of extra Place, arguing that this public land, however modest, as it is to remain publicly. 
Others have extra Place hailed as a rare – a virtually unchanged cluster of the city that should be left in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, the blog called ", his verschwindendes New York" (untertitelt with "the Book of complaints: a bitter nostalgischer look at the dying city"), has published a part of the conversation the city history extra Place, which was published in the journal "the New York" in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "extra Place is a small close impasse, even during the day remains dark and verrostete metal door, warehouses, closed windows and Regenrinnen is over flying weeks old newspapers marked". 
With few exceptions, the streets has so recently looked in one evening. 
A rat ran through the back part of the street, not far from the door, the earlier led to the CBGB, where today a more expensive clothes business. 
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the ground, not far from a fresh set of stuck with newspapers. 
Some shoppers said they had rarely thought about extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up. 
Fields, added that in his view, some people underestimate the attraction of the streets in their current state of affairs. 
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, was wet and disgust. 
Debate about bilingual education: education in English language environment 
In this edition of the ' Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and discuss lance T. Izumi the positions of the candidates bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, senior scientific staff in Kalifonischen studies and a senior director in the specialist education Sciences of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book, "not as good as you think: why the middle class needs a school choice." 
To address the Hispanic voters is a complex task. 
Barrack Obama's proposals on the subject of education are a case in point. 
Obama's campaign said a successful conclusion, "the likely afro-amerikanischen and Hispanic students, the school is lower than in white pupils" - what is true. 
In order to close this performance, recommends that Obama's education plan specifically among other bilingual transition in training for those who learn English. 
Still, there is the question to Obama, whether its use for the bilingual education places the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest to reduce the gap in the education services. 
Let us take the example of "Sixth Street Prep," a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. 
The majority of the students are hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many of which are only recently in the country to learn English. 
Yet in 2008, stunning 100 per cent pupils the fourth class the state math exam in insisting on a good level. 
Also surprising 93 per cent of children from the fourth school year in the English test as well. 
This astonishing success has been achieved with other methods than those who favors Obama. 
The Sixth Street school places its focus to review and exercise, on the slow, steady control knowledge and an attitude which tolerates no exceptions. 
Furthermore, the school, the approach after training in an English-speaking environment. This is exactly the point that Obama is to be noted, the school head Linda Mikels. 
This approach attaches to the almost ausschlies southern use of the English language in the specialist teaching. 
Mrs Mikels, rejects the idea of bilingual education, said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a student, was on the verge of from Mexico. 12 months later would enter the class space and it can no longer see again. 
"It works," she said, "it works for us." 
Obama would be a school as the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other students learning English? 
The performance of the school that would easily make the answer to that question, but the educational positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support has long been the idea of bilingual education), and his own unstinting support for the bilingual education to make predictions about Obama's uncertain reply. 
While he agrees to the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently the subject of trivialised by noted that people should stop worry about on "only English" document legislation. 
Instead, he said: "they should make sure that your child Spanish". 
When Obama, in fact, the performance gap wants to close, they should carefully consider education models to trivialise the work, rather than to despise. 
The price of oil is falling as a result of renewed fears about the economy 
The price of oil is on Monday because of fears that even the US rescue plan for the financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy, has fallen sharply. 
The crude oil futures on the New York trading stock exchange have fallen in the morning session at 7 percent to $ 99.80 per barrel. 
Since last Monday, has dropped the price by more than $ 20.

After the prices in July its peak of $ 145.29 per barrel reached had fallen, they are in this month to almost $ 90 a barrel, and then again to rise, as a result of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets. 
On Monday, investors have already shown again concerned, even though Congress officials announced that they had agreed at the weekend on a rescue plan that should be the largest in history. 
The news was overshadowed by new worries that the financial crisis is still far from complete. 
In for the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, the Citigroup to buy up the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation. 
In the meantime, have claimed by the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments the European financial group Fortis in part. 
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, is that, despite the tense negotiations at the weekend and have led to a rescue plan, apparently failed to revive the mood on the markets. 
As the economic situation deteriorates further, is to be expected that the demand for goods, among other things, for oil, will continue to fall. 
Analysts of Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note to investors, who forecasts for the global capital markets, interest rates, and exchange rates are äusserst become uncertain. 
We believe they write that the goods markets will also be affected. 
"From the perspective of the commodities markets, we are most concerned about whether the American US virus spreading throughout the world, especially to China." 
The financial analysts that the bank have lowered their expectations for the oil consumption because of the weak economic growth for the coming year adjusted downwards, and their forecasts for the oil and gas prices for the year 2009 by 20 %. 
Team record by series in the second quarter of aufgestellr 
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after he in the last eight and a half years, more often than any other in the jets auflief jersey. 
Then he saw on Sunday for the second quarter, in which the jets a result without the game turned into a Triumphzug. 
"I have never seen," said Ellis. 
After a schlampigem game between the jets, and the Arizona Cardinals, it was the bad weather, began the second quarter. 
However, when Quarterback board Favres Lavernues Coles passport for a 12-Yard-Touchdown arrived, which marked the perfect prelude to an afternoon in which their developing cooperation a giant step forward. 
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two Touch Downs, sometimes as a foreign ausrutschte defenders and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half. 
"I am not particularly hard," says Coles on passports to Coles. 
" He is a super players. 
Our vote has voted in, no matter what the people think ". 
While Favre played and Coles catching took the defense Quarterback Kurt Warner. 
Foreign defender Darrelle Revis began a stricken success and turned it into a 32-Yard-Touchdown. 
Libero Erik Smith came to a different passport and began it. 
Linebacker David Bowen's then made for a loss of Warner. 
The last ball forced loss, Bowen's was probably the verrückteste. 
The Cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game conquered when the jets the ball back conquered and Jay Feely turned a 20 Yard shot to 34 to 0 lead. 
That was the most points ever jets in a quarter. 
When he was asked to describe the madness Erik Mangini answered, coach of the jets, "the second quarter, or the third quarter?" 
On the Antworte both, because the jets in the third quarter to 21 points without a single, said Mangini: " glaub me, I have enjoyed the second quarter as the third. 
A lot of points were made in a short period of time. " 
Ausgeruhter Gebrselassie proposes his world record 
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has again shown why keep him some of the best long-distance runner of all time after he in Berlin marathon on Sunday has broken his own record, and has become the first people the route from 42.2 miles in less than two hours, and has managed to 4 minutes. 
With the victory on the flat course in 2: 03: 59 Gebrselassie has improved its prior result of 2: 04: 26 27 seconds that he had last year in Berlin. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has achieved its 26 world record in his versatile career, in which he at every route from a miles to the marathon at least one World Cup titles and set a world record. 
Last month, Gebrselassie has left the Olympic marathon in Beijing, out of fear, in hindsight, was perhaps overly that air pollution his asthma problems could get worse. 
Instead, he has registered for the competition in Berlin. 
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees on goal - has won Gebrselassie, with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile. 
Since then, rail runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya on long-haul have changed is the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in Berlin in 1998, with the result of 2: 06: 05 won. 
After his victory on Sunday Gebrselassie told the press he would have had two weeks ago Krämpfe in his Wade and therefore could not train for a week. 
He is obviously eingerostet after break and not come back. 
"I 'm so happy," he said to reporters. 
" Everything is perfect. 
I have been training a week ago and had some concerns, but in the end, all super. " 
He was criticized for - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he is leaving his Rennläufe overly orchestriert, many of the world best marathon stars generally shuns too much on the Rennanführer, as if that would be a railway race, and world records on the contest. 
But this criticism is damaging the size Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner. 
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday Gebrselassie was the center of the line in 1: 02: 04. 
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi Gebrselassie continue to have is, after the pace maker had declined. 
A little more than three miles from the Finish Gebrselassie has made his last start to separate himself from Kwambai, has improved as second in 2: 05: 36 arrived and its best time almost 5 minutes. 
Kamathi was third in 2: 07: 48. 
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan, and now the Germans, completed a remarkable year, with 2: 19: the siebtschnellste 19 result has shown of all time. 
The world record of 2: 15: 25 keeps Paul Radcliff from Britain. 
Last spring was 36 years old surprising Mikitenko won the London marathon in 2: 24: 14. 
She has missed the Games in Beijing, due to problems that have been as a back injury, as described, but she has recovered to win in Berlin and their best time in its third marathon to improve five minutes. 
It has sent its course planned by a quartet from Ethiopian and Kenyan runner only ausreissen left, but obsolete after 30 kilometres. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia, was second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya as a third in 2: 25: 01 arrived. 
The pride and the stress in the lives of the black population, in a city with the very particular kind of 
Tucked between the excesses of leisure parks within a radius of Orlando, a few miles from the glitzernden, noisy and gigantic activities, is a quiet city in which the pride and the complications of the Afro-amerikanischen culture. 
Eaton, the first entirely black city in the country, and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer so easy to describe how Hurston did in 1935, "the city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen 300 brown hide, 300 good Schwimmern, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." 
Nowadays, it is a pilgrimage site. 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eaton Ville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And yet is and remains the city – describes it, and it became a Touristenausflugsziel made by in the Florida trip leaders began to periods of depression by the Bundesschriftstellerprojekts produced – in many ways, a place of very particular kind. 
Eaton Ville is so independent, gediegen and privately how in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida are often refused to share their true thoughts with the weissen man "so little of us know that he does not know what he escapes." 
Even today, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama, calling for an open dialogue on race relations, there are many here remain to be Aussenseitern observed. 
"We are very careful as we are told," Hortense Jones, 59, from the moment of their birth, a resident of the city and community member of the oldest church of the city. 
It must be true. " 
Eaton) was for a long time as a paradox of triumph and the fight. 
It is both an historic example of the black movement, as well as a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average. 
On the one hand, it is a stronghold of literature and on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes sentenced, sometimes much-vaunted - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that people here both proud and are wary. 
And so began the concerns by Eaton Ville's image with Zora, like all of us Hurston. 
It was the world their hometown in books by heart, and were written in Mundart, as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "their Eyes were watching God" (1973) 
Five paragraphs in the Florida trip leaders modified the city, which lies close to the route 77, a road by the oft-vergessene Florida center leads to the venues of black history and a human tragedy. 
An insolent as Oskar both in real life and in the literature, Hurston led readers mayor first to the Eatonvilles shop, Joe Clarke, and then turned privateren affairs. 
"The road to left," she wrote, "the tan - becomes angestrichene modern schools, with their leafy gardens and game seats, which always takes care of Howard Miller, although he can barely read and write." 
They also mentioned the new man from widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "drinks sold of any kind, and was-auch-immer suits to hours rooms." 
In only a few hundred words brought Hurston so Eaton Ville with government in connection, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was certainly not a trip leader. 
In fact, this was not a Portrait, which was appreciated by all. 
"Zora described the things as they were," the 90-jährige Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson verewigte girls the Hurston by quoted the men, the songs on their beauty sang, were full of sexual innuendo. 
They added: "some people liked it". 
We remember here still Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin was regelmässig returned after their families after Jackson), Florida. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that, if gebraust Hurston in the city, they usually did without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, held rauchend and trousers in a city that even today, something einbildet on their venerable dress style. 
According to Mr Franklin were the most of the residents of fascinated, whereas many of you despise. 
"The people have always glad to see Zora", said Mr Franklin. 
But it "never stayed too long," he added as he schaukelte in his chair, on a backward situated pavement cafés, the looks on the Sabelia sea, in all likelihood the Hurston was baptized. 
As Hurston died in 1960, it was very poor and abusing their books. 
Together with the much of the world Eaton), it seemed to have forgotten. 
Although it was once a famous author was a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920ern, they lived in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they buried in an unmarked grave. 
There was no major commemoration ceremony in Eaton, no public readings on a massive scale. 
"I do not think that they understood their contribution in the world, or their legacy in the slightest," can fit in Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston which was published in 2003. 
The turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the city to replace the Kennedy tabloid, the slow two-way main street of the community. 
Orlandos suburbs have already had the motorway through 4 of the Western city sidelines. 
The proposal was presented as Eaton Ville still recovered from a difficult period in its history. 
Forced integration, among other things, the relatively idyllic isolation of the community to an end. 
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing hatred in the community. 
"In this period was often a bunch of white boys and they threw oranges and stuff on the sidelines sitters people," Mr. Franklin said. 
" There was even a woman who was killed. 
They threw a water melon, out of the car. " 
In 1955, behind asked Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, the demand of the Supreme Court to force integration by its decision in the case of Brown against the Schulrat as "offensive respektierend instead of my race." 
Residents now say that although the lifting of racial segregation was positively in some respects, they weakened the groups cohesion in Eaton Ville and be aware of its young people. 
"Black children were used to being umarmt - and I remember this - we embraced his teachers in the morning, and one of his teachers embraced in the evening," N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and Managing Director of the non-profit group to protect the Eaton Ville community. 
That could be as long maintained, they added, until teachers and pupils no longer come from the same place. 
"You embraced its white teachers, for he was a white teachers - and I think there is a cultural gap," said Mrs Nathiri. 
However, the civil rights have helped that room for further Zora Neale Hurstons was created - black writers, actors and artists, the override prejudices, as they did, with a positive self-confidence and statements such as, " how can anyone to refuse the joy in my society! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker on the path to Hurstons anonymous grave and began for the revival of their glory. 
Five years later was a much vowed to Hurston-Biographie by Robert E. Hemenway in the books to find shelves, and once again made it a part of the American Literaturkanons. 
Television road project just came at a time, in the most famous Eatonvilles daughter once again in the light of the public. 
And this time saw Hurstons old neighbors as Retterin. 
The community began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival in order to show what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the event opening two years later, and every January many returning for the ceremony. 
A few years later, the district from its road-building plans. 
"The plans a fünfspurigen top speed awoken highway crowded the city accelerated the whole thing with real proud citizens," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Mrs Boyd put it a little easier, "Zora Eaton rescued Ville." 
The victory against the roads project has contributed to a change of image of the city. 
There were more and more Zugereiste, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer here since 1993 in the Church, and locals the past began to appreciate. 
Eaton) was introduced in 1998, in the nationwide historic register. 
A new einstöckige library (of course, named after Hurston) opened in 2006 at the neugepflasterten and verschönerten Kennedy tabloid. 
Today, Eaton Ville is still a feature in Florida: they only 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos can sometimes anfühlen like a light alleyway in the summer rain, as small as it was then when it was founded only 27 black families in the 1880ern. 
(you nowadays is black to 90 %.) 
Outsiders in search of history Eatonvilles and its importance are often still be treated with caution. 
For most of the interviews is a licence in the run-up to necessary and certain things - as Wandbemalung eldest of Eatonvilles church which was painted by a Weissen and black men in the field of work - must not be photographed. 
Many in Eaton, as Mrs Jones, a bold, assertive teacher with a preference for Dunkelrot still fear that their secretive community misunderstood. 
And yet, at the same time, the greater the Hurston-Festival was born, was also a greater degree of home proud. 
Young people in particular tend to see Eaton Ville as Hurston saw their whole race: beautiful, with all its problems, either worse or better and equally proud, creative, and hardworking, ridiculous and mixed as any other race - and international group in America. 
It is the genuine love for this town, you can hear the voice of Mr. Franklin with nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, the plan after the college after Eaton) to return to work in the city administration or in the police, according to him, could use a little help. 
And even the relatively young, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eaton Ville right. 
" Most people who are just here, think: " oh, this city is nothing compared to all the other, " said Alondra Kenon the other day a Sunday after the church. 
"But if you stop and for a moment of its history, it is a very beautiful city." 
Here in New York, it is a fluent financial Latin. 
At first glance nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan by the newspaper and the huge television screens in Times Square held, they would not even realise that they are in the middle of a debacle. 
They would never believe that, over their heads in the schuhschachtelartigen offices with the glass facades, bankers and Hedgefondverwalter the monopoly in New York, on a daily basis the worst horror day since the 1929 stock market fall. 
The suppliers still read Klappern the metal Teewägen along walkways and promote Tabletts with Muffins loaded for breakfast meetings. 
Schlurfen Latinos will still between apartment around how human Pack animals freighted with the 50 gebügelten T-shirts in a yoke ahead on their shoulders similar contexts. 
Office workers are still waiting to go up on the citizens, when food items on their Frühstücksbagel and it is still impossible in a Wochentag between 16 and 19.00 p.m. to get a yellow taxi. 
It has not felt as a crisis until I decided Thursday afternoon because of all the doomsday talk to open a new savings account.

The money out switchgear money or figures, but to the customer service counters where habitués checkbooks cultivate tourists after the way the department Macy's and ask where open up new customer accounts. 
Most before me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employees with licence", for the same reason as I queue. 
In contrast to me, however, they have already had their Erspartes removed from smaller banks in places from where they pendelten, as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island. 
They had money from so-called Thrifts (a bit of a Bausparkasse ähnelnd), cooperative banks and the local savings banks, which have only in a state branches, remote and say that they treat their clients like family. 
Last year, 15 are these banks quietly gone bust. 
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets of $ 327 billion, in receivership on, and as of last Friday in New York over the weekend came home, Wachovia was another bank savings assets worth $ 440 billion, in search of a nation-saving buyers. 
In the fear of further collapse, the office and shop staff before me their Bares were scheduled to a bank that is seen as a safe haven, a bank for most rescue buying on Wall Street is responsible.

" I welcomes the champion behind the stage, in order to maintain its character ', Günter Brauer,, photographer. 
No paragraphs, no Rüsche, no Kostüme for the entrance. 
The nature of the big Flamenco dancer who renounce the concentration and focus the interpretation in order to get a entspanntes appearance as a woman or a man. 
On the one hand, artists 
On the other hand, personality 
I am looking into private lives in these moments, which are alien for the audience, I know when I for the typical personality gesture, the depth of a stolen costs or Ausdrückstärke of hands are concerned because they do not enter the stage, can find. 
In his project " Flamenco people ' of the German photographer Günter Bauer Abwechselungs some rich drama typical of the sort of performance on the stage with singer, dancer and Gitarristen. From this side he was still little known for artists. 
With this proposal creates, photographer a special Ikonografie the Flamenco presentation at different levels. 
The exhibition, which is on the programme of the month the photograph of the Flamenco heard " reflects the international importance of Flamenco from day to day, ' says the artist, and makes it clear that " Flamenco people ' " any human being can be, but if you look at the photos, the spectator notes that there is no typical pictures of artists are at the scene. 
Ordinary people are on the portraits of artists, who are in the situation on the stage passion, sadness, happiness and to the audience. 
The personality of the artists to keep, you must not make photographs at the scene. 
Their personality and character is in their hearts. 
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere, which would allow me to stick with the photo camera the characters, the largest Flamenco masters '. 
Bauer, inspired by the festival, " Cante de Minas read ', in 1997, on a long journey to singer to photograph Gitaristen or dancer with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the Bildsortierungsfunktion the camera and the existing material created pictures recall classic photograph. 
The use of different stylistic destroyed means the traditional basis of the picture, the image of modernity and the idea of how the farmer Flamenco understands: " music with traditional roots, changed and surprised every day '. 
These are not only the dance, song, or Instrumental game in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, the audience with his art. 
The search for the essence, after a certain thing, which is presented in the form of the Hörens, of being visible is and was a firm target this work, which in the coming period in the gallery of the El Fotómata. 
Well-known figures in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente crony and others belong to the close selection of almost 70 artists, were photographed.

Inspired by "Episodios Nacionales ' Benito Pérez is Galdós, José Luis Carci in" Sangre de mayo ' the revised version of the famous uprising of Spaniards against the French. This is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with approximately EUR 15 million investment for hub. 
In this way, the Cineast has tried to portray " a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he had always been in the works of the famous novel writer admired, said today Carci in the presentation of the Filmes with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers.

However, the Cineast regrets that with the financing, as in "Alatriste ' or ' going on fantasmas de Goya ' (twice as high as in" Sangre de mayo ') could not have been able to count, which is why some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, almost with the Garci worked his entire career, will not be done. 
For this reason, has Garci, who was also film director in " Volver a empezar ', played by his unique way: he turned on the stage to the site of players with which you need to rehearse first before you start to turn, and for those who had no Casting, he appeared " humiliating ' verschaffend and respect, " a part of the profession of the film's director is to deliver aid in the theatre and cinema in order to know what is happening in the cinema industry, in the works. 
Many performers to which he is in " Sangre de mayo, must repeat before his cameras, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.

" We are not trying to tell about their lives, but to preserve their Esprit, ' said Flamenco dancer. 
Their dance foundations have helped me in Flamenco much.

Her dancing was sinnlich and I had been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic ', they said.

The US can imagine without Paul Newman bad 
" Sometimes God creates perfect personalities. 
Paul Newman was one of them. 
The phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in " Sensationsreporterin ', and of the prevailing idea of the American cinema, which was abandoned by the whole of America to Newman, with his enthusiastic presentation and followed her. 
Now display what it cost him the Oscar. 
And when he withdrew in 2007. 
And he knew that he was very ill. 
Nevertheless, this was a great blow for all. 
"What is a sometimes feels much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend, ' said Robert Redford boy called Clément was found," my life and my country were the biggest Drolligkeiten of his life. 
No one was afraid not to make ridiculous to exaggerate. 
As a "father" of the cinema and the father of the country it is dead in a sad moment for fear of terrorists and before the market there is Zusammenbruch, in which the battered self-esteem of Americans on the desperate search for reasons of dignity. 
In this hard time without virtue only a few people you can admire, you should not necessarily be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
For all he embodied a platonisches ideal of beauty and truth. 
He was official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as several losses both also profits, from the Foundation, dedicated to the fight against drugs and to honor his son from a first marriage, died of overdoses, was created to its own brand of internal and organic products. 
All of this is a gift for the country, which cost him a lot of effort to impose itself on a lethal food culture. 
A broad wave of surprise House proposes high on Hollywood regardless of nationalities and citizenship. 
The last James Bond, Daniel Craig English, confirmed that it is not only a man died, but the whole era. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar laureates, said that the work with Newman was no more and no less than the peak of his career. 
Russell Crowe, the bad boy, who came from Australia, dared to call Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
" The greatest thing that all of us to leave, confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few dare today try to live as Paul Newman lived: maintain high standards of probity, a responsible private life, far away from the cameras. 
It is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle. 
But there is someone to try it, and Paul Newman was an example of this. 
It was a time, and was then married fifty years with Joanne Wood Ward he was faithful, although it certainly there have been many opportunities to be. 
" What should I eat a hamburger on the street, if I have the pearls at home? ' he scherzte often itself. 
In the sky, he will be proud of the fact that the world his daughters the same opinion as his fans, which is customary in America, not necessarily. 
" Of all the major roles he played, he was not so proudly as the loyal spouses, loving father, the attentive Opas and the Philanthropen ', they say. 
For the Olympic Games are the streets in Madrid. 
Yes, the dream is that many of us to organise some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be but perhaps 2016. 
But I wonder: " we are prepared for this? ' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say that it is not true! 
It has been described as a perfect street and, in my judgment, it was the worst road with all the wiser and off it. 
Of course, that is a lot of nonsense if you would pay attention to assessment and I could see what would clearly not. 
But, from the outset, we all. 
The nonsense begins with the ticket to get to you allowed to go, as the first. 
It seems to me, too, should not be a bad thing, but if you do, then they give you everything (including chip, in order to avoid the congestion on the road). 
Not yet. 
They let you only get the ticket (the first nonsense, which is the only reason to go) and (after a never-ending waiting lists) because the surprise is, the T-Shirt, there were only in the size of the "s" (a second nonsense because I need the size XL) 
Where we live? 
Or is it the case that was decided after the crisis only small, much cheaper to buy shirts from less stuff? 
Well, things like this are a small beer compared with the days on the street. 
Apart from the fact that you have very early to go to the chip, there is already a waiting lists of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you must let schoolbag. 
The wait has taken more than 35 minutes, which are expected in the case of a street, where 11 36000 people, is incomprehensible. 
After all, as it was to be expected, began the streets and we have had our back bags not leave, even if it was once managed to recover, but they would be more difficult. 
It also saw in those waiting 40 minutes by rain, so it was tempting to organize a popular uprising and attacked the excited. 
I think this morning, to be sure, some 500 people have pneumonia and some as I can, because this chip, which I received, not even in time the classification, I think that the outcome was wrong. 
Of course, if you ask me, after a perfect street would this road would never improve. 
So I think we are still a long dream of a city, which is well prepared for the Olympic Games 
Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
On the " emerging Technology Conference ' am from MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new Bilderkennungssystems and human interaction, a nature of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is able to do some primitive tasks, such as, for example, order a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a routes planners to move on the campus of the firm). The system to what it does during the entertainment. 
Thanks to a camera and a form - and Gesichterkennungssystem can remember these " Rezeptionistin ' realize how many people in the area are who they are, and even as they were held, it can listen and understand key words of their entertainment. 
It can also view the House following the talks in the groups. 
In the presentation said video " the Rezeptionistin ' a third person, but it goes without saying that this person to the group, which leads with her conversation is not, and that is not a firms employee. 
They wonder whether the person wants to visit someone listen and respond that they will soon. 
All without blue Screenshot 
Impressive 
Surely this is the future. 
Now the company has better terms on which it can concentrate, for example, to the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week there was much on the surface on the change of strategy from Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be faster and not so many have included programs. 
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computer would be equipped with the Notwendigsten, rather than to fill it with the commercial waste, so they would work five times faster. Man, Steven will be just for the few. 
Everything is just an observation, given that Microsoft Windows versions a function or other and causing " extras '. 
The shift is worth 
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is beginning to lose, just as the software. 
As Google chromium in seemed to network, that was a part of the theory that it was the first step of Google in order to compete with Windows. 
Sent many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system. 
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be needed to ensure that hardware and software can work at the same time. 
The operating system meets the role with the role his wife or his husband can be compared to tell when it comes to his mother-in-law. 
That is true. 
The system will never disappear, but we must of his "death", not as an absolute, but as a relative truth, thinking. 
What Ballmer said this week, is the affirmation of this idea. 
People pay less attention every time the operating system, the Web-Browser. 
The computer will only launched the Firefox to execute the Explorer or chromium and every day, we spend more time on surfing in the vicinity of the ' window '. 
What serves half of existing computer applications? 
Less is more 
And Windows 7 must be compact, much more compact than vista. 
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated. 
The interest from Microsoft's more is to integrate its online services, which are then, after all, the alternative to Google. 
In reality they need without doubt. I am a small example of this. 
The photograph of this place, I have made in Redmond, in one of the recreational spaces for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. 
On the soft drinks machine is a sign that says: " your. Our future '. It will print a request to use their own tool for online search. 
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that the 66 % of employees at Microsoft, Google for the research used on the network. 
Incidentally, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 of the delay. 
It is not early, but the end of 2009, rather even 2010. 
Microsoft is seeking the possibility of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time on the market. 
Every day the phone turned into a computer. 
The Android, and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso in Costa angehabt Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had that mark in " blood Diamond " by Edward Zwick, just as Al Pacino in " the godfather of Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it is one of clothing a well built pastor.

The drivers of the reoffend because of alcohol can install the " Alcolock '. 
Does the authority that the driver, who had three official penalties because of the alcohol levels, this system in his car, which forbidding him in drunken state to launch the car ; if he is drink-drivers, then in the car. 
The initiative was announced last month in June and now a part of the report, the Attorney General is sheep. They claim it is a pilot project, which, for a year, will take. 
The purpose is the recovery of the driver, which is why this gets a course for the re-education of transport behavior. 
In addition to the Public Prosecutor's Office, experience, the Department of Transport and the Foundation's Technical Institute for car safety of mobile take part. 
According to statistics, between 30-75 % of motorists who more than once for driving under the influence of alcohol were reported back to the tax. 
The " alcolock ' would prevent that, because it is a system with the car linked it attaches the alcohol content in the ausgeatmeten air and prevented car start if the driver has made alcohol test, or if a found alcohol concentration, which is higher than allowed. 
It costs more than 1 36000 euros, the cost will be borne by the sanction imposed.

In Spain it is reckoned that it 115 people a year could be saved lives. 
The measure is confined to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: this behaviour to address before it a criminal offence werd. 
And in order to facilitate their implementation, can be realized a legitimate reform of the ordinary, and yet calls for a reform of the constitution, which is necessary for the prosecution process.

Talking in sleep 
Some children speak at night 
I do not mean those who wake up and tell what happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep. 
If you is happening for the first time, in the best case scenario would be shocked, but in reality, that has no significance. 
This is a positive sleep disorder, speaking in their sleep. 
It is fairly common, especially among children and young people. 
To be sure, was more than one of you are told that their spoken at night. 
This phenomenon can occasionally (a time in life, such as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, a time per week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing. 
There is not one single reason caused this phenomenon. 
Often sought links with other phenomena in their sleep, such as nightmares, panic at night, Enuresis noctura (Bettnässen at night), speaking in their sleep, but there is no reason for it. 
As we mentioned earlier, we cannot have very high Fiber, stress situations or too much. 
In any case, this is a little erforschtes phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it is, very variable. 
It may be that it speaks calmly in individual words, rubbing, or it can be a contrary (cries, wines, long discussions). 
In the cases, if the statement is very hard to watch, it is recommended that the baby and a specialists to consult to check whether there is a problem, which caused fear and in this way. 
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, it is, it is linked to a different sleep disorder can be treated (for example, with the Schlaf-Apnoe or with the stress). 
What can be done, is a series of simple preventative measures. 
Try not to get a child before the sleeping. 
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressige television programmes that are terrible and a little too wild. 
The nervous children, which Entspannungen recommended that can be applied relaxation techniques to help them to get some inner calm. 
That would help the child to sleep. 
If the speaking in sleep, which is trying to remain calm. 
Thinks that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will be able to not remember what happened. 
Useful advice 
Weck it. 
This is useless, because the child is unconsciously, it would pull out of sleep. 
Even though the child, sleep, so it is based. 
Think, if it is after a pair of scared phenomena shows, it is recommended to discuss or find out what is the reason for the child for the fear. 
If they understand what it says (which is not usually), the child is not under pressure to carry out an interrogation, and more herauszubekommen information. 
So you will able to achieve nothing, because if the baby is sleeping, it is unconsciously, and not to think about it. 
Also, to hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it says that is why they are cautious with the interpretation of the information, and the conclusions it. 
It may not telling a child that their hear the night and his secrets. 
Not even as a joke. 
This caused a great deal of fear. 
So, no worries, there is nothing wrong with it, this is a moment, which takes only a few minutes. 
Illhäusern... finally 
After a long drought Illhäusern is finally on the pitch to success rate. 
Without much effort, the yellow erspielten many blacks Torchancen and made it to implement a, and so to win the game. 
The pace of this meeting, in which the attackers had trouble to show their skills was not very high. 
After a first attack of the host captain Kauffmann, whose television just shot over in the corner, Illhäusern should easily dominate the game, and in turn managed only Fonderflick with a television shot, then the brain with a higher passport and Romain with a shot with the Fußspitze challenge the defense of Denmark.

The start of the second half, should be decisive with first by two Riahi and hard-won Temporale Torchancen, and immediately afterwards, with the first goal for the Marais Illhäuser, was exactly the right thing to do to address a ball again, which was the first attempt by Diebold. 
But the illhäusische Torschütze should not be luck can enjoy a long and about 12 minutes later sent to the bank, which his team comrades numerically inferior to continue to play.

" Do you realise that a vote in Minsk was '? 
Young people and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening on the main place of Belarusian capital already in advance to reject the results of the parliamentary elections. 
A few hundred White Russians gathered Sunday evening since the closure of polling stations in the market place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.

Some admit that they have not elected ": what good is that, if they ever make with my vote, what they want, says a young people. 
They do not believe that the regime that the foreign observers has shown in the best light in order to restart the negotiations with the European Union, is ready to a democratic change. 
The sanctions, including the failure to grant visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities, and the Aufeislegen certain assets could be lifted if these elections from the observers would be considered to be clean. 
According to the opposition, they were not there. 
" We have been excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting part, lamented Yuri Potemkin, press spokesman for the Union of democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of 12 parties.

If members of the opposition to get into parliament, then because they were appointed, not elected. 
But her entry into Parliament can air time on television, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals mean '.

Because if our economy that Russia is heavily in debt to be in a crisis, and we don't reform, we run the risk of a protectorate of Russia. 
Now, we want to be independent.

" Do you realise that a vote has taken place? Asks the leader of the Social Democrats, Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners were released in August this year. 
In the local election was none. 
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, and the ones who are most likely to reflect the wishes of the government. ' 
The silence lowers the night back on the October Square. 
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission to their success. 
Meeting - from blood that was surely 
Hema Quebec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding and its President, Dr. Francine Décary had every reason to rejoice, because Hema Quebec has become one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. 
And, above all, it has won the confidence of the public, which has been shaken by the scandal from the contaminated blood in the 1980's and 1990's. 
As you know, the national blood from the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross managed reserves during the 1980's with HIV and hepatitis C-Virus contaminated. 
Given this tragedy, and the public discontent, the Canadian Government in February 1994 a public, the judge Horace Krever led investigation, which was intended to shed light on the circumstances, which had led to such a tragedy, and draw up guidelines to prevent another disaster of this nature. 
While judges hesitate Krever, his report to make, then several provinces a Committee on its feet, whose goal it was to develop a new system for managing blood in Canada. 
In Quebec met the committee Gélineau this mandate. 
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever were founded in Canada two blood banks: Hema Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, in order to provide the other provinces and the two territories. 
" In 1998, when Hema Quebec is at work, little 38 % of the people had faith in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers. 
The situation was not encouraging. 
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood and the work in this area over the following years, we have won the confidence of the public, she says, before they proudly emphasized that the beginning of 2008 now almost 94 % of the population of Quebec confidence in Hema Quebec. 
Dr. Décary but retains knowing that " trust is something extremely fragile. 
Since its inception, is on 28 September 1998 Hema Quebec following the principle of caution. 
At the time, we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new kind of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the woman told the since its inception in 1998, holding the leadership. 
" And we had not the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood. 
So we invoked one of the main directives reports from Krever, and Gélineau that applies to the exclusion of action if you do not know, and if a disease only slowly continues, as it appears in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a degeneration of the brain, which will inevitably lead to death. 
So, in April 1999, no blood of people who had since 1980 longer than a month in the United Kingdom. 
Now, a few years ago, was shown without any doubt that the disease of the blood. 
So has shown us this event that the principle of caution, which we would apply, has a sense. 
In 1999, appeared on the market, a much more precise technology to detect HIV: the Nukleinsäure-Tests (NST), which allow directly in the blood of the donor to prove that the presence of the virus itself, and not the antibodies against the virus, as it did in the past used tests the case. 
The NST, enabled to shorten the incubation period, between the time the infected person and, if the first viruses through our techniques can be found in the blood, the specialist. 
This time could be reduced to a period of less than a week. 
It was the risk that some could be infected donors, without knowing it, and one that may not recognize much reduced. 
These improvements have allowed it to cut the risk of AIDS on a blood transfusion to transfer to a large extent. 
Today, is one of 12 million people in danger, blood contaminated with HIV. 
" In other words, that means that 12 million would distribute blood, before someone infected with HIV. 
Because Hema Quebec each year between 400,000 distributed and 500,000 blood, it would take more than 24 years before occurs in the case of HIV was transferred on a blood Konserve. 
I believe that you can now feel comfortable if you get a blood transfusion or prescribed to restore health ', says the Direktions head of Hema Quebec. 
" Our challenge for the next ten years, it is to preserve the safety of our products. 
One never knows how germs can get into the system. 
Only last year has appeared on the island of Réunion the chikungunya virus, which is just as the Westnil-Virus by insects on the blood. 
We must constantly monitor, Dr. Décary continues before they emphasized that Hema Quebec in addition to a safe supply must also a sufficient supply. 
" The demand is rising, because the population is aging. 
Because the treatments are aggressive cancer patients need often new red blood cells, or Blutplättchen. 
The ageing population also has an impact on the network of blood donors, to an average of only 3 % of people eligible to donate blood include Quebec. ' 
Can anyone healthy man, who is 18 years or older, and meet the eligibility criteria, all 56 days, so six times in the year to give blood. 
On average, 14 % of the people who make their blood not adopted, because they are, for example, AIDS or malaria, and who is in a country where malaria is endemic, will be excluded for one year by the donations. 
" With these 3 % we create an inventory to preserve that meets the needs of the hospitals. 
The lack of supplies are rare. 
But we must renew the members of this donor network when they are older, and no more to give blood. 
It is hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them, and to bring them to be regular donors. 
Life today is so hectic that one rarely finds the time to spend an hour in the blood donations, Francine Décary regrets. 
With an annual budget of $ 297 million Hema Quebec provides not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone transplant, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin almost exclusively used heavy fire violations. 
These tissues are investigated, and frozen before they are stored in Hema Quebec between, the only public cord blood bank managed Quebec. 
In the umbilical cord, previously was regarded as a biomedical waste, is on stem cells rich blood, which can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia. 
" A few weeks ago, we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood test, and we plan more than a thousand per year. 
" We should start at the beginning of next year, to make it available for transplantation, explains Dr. Décary on this programme of abnahme umbilical cord blood - described as a very popular. 
" Many mothers are convinced no access to have ', because Hema Quebec lack the resources to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals of Quebec.

Although it has been mentioned in the last time, often in the speeches of the Prime Minister, was the opening of the North - the northern area on the 49sten latitude - have never been the subject of a presentation. 
The Prime Minister, however, simply restated to explain why the North, " a jewel with enormous potential ', but it should be called no date, no investment amounts or specific priorities for the next projects. 
At most a few prospects for what more could be worked: in particular, in the water, energy, the forest, but particularly in the mining sector, aided by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of the public infrastructure. 
According to the list of Mr Charests has the north " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds '. 
This "is twice as large as France '" is in our close in Quebec. 
It is not only in our near, it is within us ', he emphasized, such as to show that he is seeking a national founder dream to fruition. 
Quebec is very grown by his association with the North, he stressed that the road to gold in the Abitibi technology of Quebec, James Bay. 
"It belongs to us, it is our future", he added, after he had a theatrical pause in order to see the huge card. 
To the north, 70 % of the area of Quebec, a part of Labrador includes the Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister, told the press. 
" This is a traditional attitude all governments. 
There is a line, which provides for a very long time is no agreement if the opportunity, I will take this stance on behalf of the government, he said. 
In addition, " with the climate change we need to rethink our vision from the north, he said, and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be due to the Eisschmelze throughout the year befahrbar. 
In this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to fill this area. 
And the people of the area, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit? 
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very careful with them, and that they would benefit from this project, particularly the boys. 
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former pekistischer a representative of Ungava) have already begun discussions about 30 communities. 
A minister led by Benoît Pelletier Committee, in which Julie Boulet (transport and natural resources) to play an important role, the work has included. 
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large assembly, "not necessarily a summit ', but an opportunity," you will create a common vision. 
The development of the North in the rest, in line with the principles of sustainable development. 
The plan North will be discussed, " regulated and environmentally friendly ', he promised. 
Jean Charest described these " vision, as if they were a continuation of the liberal Prime Minister was before him in office. 
" As the Liberals, who were in the office turn that around, we have to turn the challenges in new growth and Entwicklungschanchen. 
That was, in fact, one of the issues raised the weekend on Friday with a large cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership was opened by Jean Lesage. 
One of the decisions adopted provides the power station of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm name. 
" Of Godbout has created Hydro-Quebec on Lesage, the quiet revolution has achieved, and the nationalization of the water, electricity, to Bourassa, who knew the James Bay has always been our party to determine the future ', Jean Charest said. 
To the press, he took on a different, this time conservative project, on the program " Roads to the North by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963. 
In terms of the project Eastmain1a-Ruper Wasserkraft dam, Mr Charest stressed that the operation was scheduled for 2012. 
" The remains of us, but I have to be, ' he trusted his party members what those ovations. 
The Prime Minister, said in April that there would be in 2008, and also, of course, in 2009, no elections, has not ruled out the possibility of this autumn a vote to hold him in law is possible. 
He emphasized that his diary, however, is primarily due to a mission of Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. 
The General Assembly at the weekend earned the liberal party boss a platform from nationalist plans, especially from "the Constitution objectives ', which were adopted without further: the PLQ demands especially the recognition of the" special nature of Quebec's in the Constitution. 
They would also like to Quebec members of the Council of the Canadian broadcasting and telephony names, and that a veto on the decisions handed down in Quebec. 
The opposition have been the guidelines of the plan included North with skepticism. 
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, politics has been to the development of the Nord-du-Quebec again, the government introduced Landry 2001. 
According to the liberal government when in 2003, came to power up to apply it. 
If they would have done it, " we would have been much further today, Mrs Marois ruled on the side of their candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ has called for the adoption of a plan to support the North by the government. 
" But what we want is that this will not only a great idea, said party leaders Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who now back from holiday. 
The letter - a entehrtes country 
Mr Vic Toews, Ex - Justice ' minister (how ironic) in the cabinet, Harper, it was the last summer say, Louise Arbour, it is a "disgrace" for Canada. 
This woman has a never-ending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration, so with cover opprobrium, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister, as Parker on Stephen itself. 
Here we have to do with a government as the only for all of the affected countries in the concentration camps compatriot caught Guantanamo has not taken home. 
A government that is not even that Omar Khadr was a young man, when things who crossed him. 
The only government, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaking its word and a child soldier in inhumane conditions stagnate. 
The only to a judicial parody deigning to assess the guilt of the accused. 
We have to remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers call for Omar Khadr to get home so that he gets a fair trial in Canada. 
It is this government is turning a blind eye to the torture: they are more interested in little that one young adults after so many years of ordeal will certainly be forever mentally broken. 
We are not yet aware, but here we are seeing a insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the word that Harper before it like a banner, and so out of his mouth vacuous sounds. 
So it is the time when there is no morality: a Canadian citizens must act arbitrarily abuse, torture, and to lock up quite fit for a head of government, which is supported by today, only a minority (he quite after the 14 October belong to a minority...). 
Many voters feel their salvation to find in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has broken away from what the reputation and dignity of our country. 
The disgrace, Mr Toews, is in this Lossagung, and nowhere else. 
Free - The orwellsche speech by Barrick gold 
In its spending on 17 September Le Devoir, published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Barrick gold mine gold. 
Confirms this, and a orwellsche logic, that the largest gold production society in the world a libel case about six million against three authors, and a small instrument By publishing house, with the aim of a " transparent public debate to open '. 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge on the truth, especially in the case of smear complaints, but about the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference has been completely glossed over by Mr Garver. 
For Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, to ruin dares to represent one of the its opposite opinion. 
No matter how the process, the authors and the editor of the book Noir between Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money in order to prepare their defense, and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight to be paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. 
The tactic is unequal battles in the rest of the often to ruining the defenders in order to force an amicable settlement, which makes the other side and also that discourages anyone who dares to look again at the issue. 
If Barrick gold really wanted to a public debate, she would present their point of view of things before the public opinion. 
By contrast, what works in many of the countries in which Barrick gold, is a matter of debate in Canada, usually through the exchange of ideas, and not by Knüppelhiebe. 
So it would have been if the gold mine revealed their books and files have been opened, and a real debate, by the newspapers, the media, publishing and the financing of independent audit teams have light on that question. 
But Barrick gold seems to have confidence in public opinion and shut the petitions and letters of support for the Noir between authors of Canada with one hand movement. 
Maybe Mr Garver explain how he could ask at the same time, a "public" debate, but the views of these public? 
Apparently this word in the world of vice president, only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians ; a very nice beengte view of the term. 
In a democracy, even the detractors the right to speak. 
What does not understand Barrick gold - or don't want to understand - is that the general public, the authors and publishers supported by Noir between Canada, this is mostly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
The public is willing to listen and Barrick, to judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in a framework, which many as little publicity perceive complaint (in the course of the " public debate ' Barrick gold has just a requirement for the authors by Noir between Canada, in which it is asking them not to use this term more...). 
Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, is the complaint of Barrick Gold a direct attack on the freedom to academic research, and the truth are essential to any democratic society. 
It denies the right to quote credible sources, and to discuss facts and interpretations, which are the basis of the intellectual work. 
If it is impossible in a country such as Canada, to explore issues and to discuss the rich companies not of this world, who else can this do then? 
If Barrick gold really wanted to be a public and transparent debate, it could lead by follows the scientific standards, which have been used by the authors of Noir between Canada. 
It has a right to respond. 
The university environment to which we belong to resolve has long known debates and disagreements to control and conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that they, in contrast to what they claim is in no mood for a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the university world, as it was for the public debate, and it is time that the governments to take measures the complaints this kind of unjustified. 
Bailout for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand 
The Bush administration and the senior Members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, yesterday came to an agreement on the most economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan on a $ 700 billion, is to stop the financial crisis, which for months shocked Wall Street, must be approved by the two Congressional chambers. 
Are the main content: a better control of MPs on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of public money, new orders, to reduce the number of because of debt arrears foreclosed homes, as well as the right to monitor the salaries paid to executives of companies. 
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representatives present in the negotiations of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon. 
" We have made great progress toward a settlement of the market will be effective, the officials said the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
" It all happened in order to protect the real economy and the American people before the crisis on Wall Street, the Democrat said. 
"This is the basic point: if we do not, the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in the daily lives of Americans, to be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, from fear of the effect of another failure on the mood of investors. 
The deadline, which had been agreed, was the market opened this morning. 
The two American presidential candidates, the late involved in the negotiations, were more likely than supporters of the agreement, but without fail to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that they must take this extreme way. 
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted that the addition of some orders for agreement, especially those that will enable the owners to keep their homes, and the salaries of senior executives of the companies rescued by the state. 
" If we the taxpayers asks, owing to the irresponsibility of certain people to take extraordinary measures, it is not what we could. 
But these measures are necessary, he said on the American television stations. 
When he was asked at another station, whether he will vote in favour of the proposed plan, said his Republican opponent John McCain: " I would like to not know the details, but I hope it. 
" The guidelines, which I have read [show] that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and we will be able to move forward. 
The option to do nothing, is simply not acceptable, he said. 
The $ 700 billion plan is designed to with taxpayers ' money 
He is 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble, the first of the collapse of the risky mortgage loans (subprime), before other forms expanding verbreiteterer bonds (PCAA) and, finally, in a freezing the financial power, and in the ruin of banks and financial institutions. 
A group of Republican lawmaker was last week, the first attempt to agreement could fail. 
Since then, the Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulties only guaranteed by the government and should not be bought escape believes the impasse. 
The point of view for all round in the Congress, it has also added a available, which says that if the government with this program within five years should make losses, then it could impose new taxes, their investments. 
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion, on top of the other 100 billion, if the president considers it necessary. 
The payment 350 billion more needs to be approved in a vote by Congress. 
In exchange for his help Washington receives stakes in the companies, which in the case of profits dividends, and it can sell if the storm is over. 
The federal government will have the opportunity Pfändungs procedures regarding the homes in the real estate loans affected by this plan tied to stop and deadlines for repayment and severance payments, being paid to senior executives of the companies affected. 
The developers of the plan would have liked that the Chamber of Deputies already votes on it, and the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all of their efforts is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light. 
In fact, yesterday up more votes against this project from both sides of the Republicans and the Democrats. 
" Clearly understands Washington told us not ', the Republicans ' Scott Garett, a member of the financial Commission of the chamber, his voters. 
" Yes, we have a big financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not, which is to ask taxpayers to pay '. 
The democratic MP Brad Sherman, the head of a group in the Congress, " the Kaukus the skeptics ' is known, is different, but to the same conclusion. 
" Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: we ask the Congress not to put pressure on, and to consider carefully, which is the way to go, he said yesterday. 
At the same time, we were again in Europe is the proof that it is a global crisis. 
At an emergency assembly announced three Benelux countries the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros ($ 16.3 billion). 
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would abandon its Konkurrentin to buy is in trouble, since it has lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis by the risky real estate loans in the United States. 
Fortis 85,000 employed persons and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
' This is not a wasted money, said yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos. 
To compensate for we have a right to vote and influence in the bank. 
This is exactly what the estimate savers and households now because announce uncertain times. ' 
During this period was on the other side of the Channel of the British Government, another of the financial crisis in dire straits, expressed to nationalise Bank. 
According to the English press the government would all current loans to the bank Bradford and Bringley take over 41 billion (US $ 75.5 billion), from real estate loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander yesterday announced that it would serve the branches and customers accounts of the British bank. 
Bradford and Bringley would nationalise after Northern Rock, the second Bank, which the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925 2008) - the death of a dedicated icon 
Its beauty with the Azur blue eyes, a long time was his trump card, no one would say its weakness. 
The American actor with the charming smile from narzisstischen mirror? 
Yes and no. 
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have kept him just from a position of power away from the truly dreadful monster to the world. 
But what a great duration runner! 
The golden years on Friday at the age of 83 years from the effects of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut late Paul Newman remains one of the last icons of the American cinema. 
He was less was monumental than Brando, which he and for which it has long been a kind of rival on the screen, careful in its spectacle, certainly fragile, but as an apostle of freedom and Sprengens dramaturgischer conventions. 
In brief blood often makes wonderful children. 
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as the son of a German Jews and an ethnic Hungarians mother. 
From its European roots should one of the glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without excessive ego, ultimate quality. 
Because it reflected a whole country, which was in the Self-made-man falls in the fighters, who was seriously wounded in the Pacific war in battle, in the early 1950s spectacle studying art in Yale and then the Actor's Studio in New York, before he has had success at the theatre, on television and, soon, in the cinema. 
He is the man who fought for the rights of citizens, has also been the driver, who lived in 1979 at the 24-hour race of Mans Second, and also a Sexsymbol, even though he, along with the actress Joanne Wood Ward since 1958, in a Vorzeigebeziehung. 
With him away the unknown facets of this arcane, timid, committed and the glamour of the überempfindlichen show business stars, whose mystery will never completely solve. 
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word. 
The death of Paul Newmans left the cinema lovers this weekend in Taumel, while on the dark screen all memories of his great roles were. 
More than half a century of American film art is in constant change with him over. 
When the charming cowboy "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969), and the young man who has his sinnliche woman (Elizabeth Taylor) in The cat on a hot tin roof, the 1958 verfilmt Tennessee Williams. 
It will be a much shorter recent memory (1990), his sensitive Mr Bridge in his old age by a wedding is not fulfilled all its promises. 
So many other Paul Newmans there was in the course of history. 
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable Boxer Rocky Graziano from Some Body act Up There Likes Me (A handful of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, whose death was right and the Newman in 1956 made known. 
This pleasant crook in towering The Sting (The brilliant idea), the 1973, with the Oscar for best film was excellent. 
As verbitterter and vengeful Billard players in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961), 
This face by the time, that he was. 
He still. 
In his CV, unite eras. 
The youth, knows it, especially from the cult movie Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), when Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox coach of an ice hockey teams. 
His fans found him in 1994, The Hudsucker Proxy the Coen brothers. 
With a final role in 2003 as a godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes joined the circle. 
In contrast to several cinema legends should soon enough from the film world have withdrawn, Newman for a long stay in the saddle, and Hollywood, betrayed his wealth, his future and his concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him not without humour as living challenge to the " Under playing ' when he told his too powerful performance beur. 
The preserve has not always been easy for the fine Paul Newman, the zuflogen roles for a long time. 
He played but rare Sunnyboys as outsiders: Neurotiker, alcoholic Fieslinge or desperate people with perfect portrayal he slide and his revolt reflected. 
As a director of unknown revealed Newman sides of his true feinfühligen sensitivity. 
Be Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the Roman of Margaret Laurence Kanadierin) with his wife, Joanne Wood Ward in the lead role, a feinsinniges women portrait of melancholy. 
He lost his son Scott by an overdose of this devoted his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work of delicacy and sadness. 
The flood of honours yesterday on ergoss Newman, said his close friend and former weapons associate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) very taken: " his presence has improved my life and this country '. 
Generosity and life were essential features of the late actor. 
Aside from his legendary career is also a great champion of civil rights, environmental protection and the independent cinema, an opponent of the drift Hollywood. 
We have kept him often foot in nuts and fully Vinaigrette, in Saucen, pastries, or other food stand, and this is quite distasteful, even though we initially fun. 
The profits from its sales yet entered into his Foundation for children in need. 
Rather than rest on his myth Newman dedicated to the scene. 
He left behind his five daughters a letter with these sentences: " always and, until finally, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star. 
It was a privilege to be here. ' 
And for us, it was an honour, the life of one so intelligent and generous American actor. 
A good citizens in the closest and in its broadest sense. 
What has been produced in the accounting factory contract & Co? 
On 8 October start the negotiations in the criminal case against János contract and his accomplices. 
The defendants, in particular, the participation of organised crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts - among other things, accused of counterfeiting of documents. 
According to the Public Prosecutor have used the from the invitations to lukrierten resources for their own purposes, while the services provided were often with counterfeit bills. 
Government money and grants from the self-governance - a total of HUF 65 million - partly in the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly in private individual funds flowed. 
Like the investigating authorities gave known, were presented at the Beziehen the tender money fictitious accounts, and the clubs their obligations should not be. 
According to the indictment is said to be a large part of the bills have been falsified. 
The accounting units have been purchased in the market of Józsefváros, the seal was in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision about how firms should be issued bills, it was decided on the István on that tour of north of Lake Balaton Lados was sent János contract. 
In the wake of this "fact-finding tour" should Lados pensions and find restaurants. 
He asked bills on the Konsumationen to later on these proposals based bills for the youth and sports ministry, the social and labor ministry, as well as the self-governance of Budapest. 
These bills are supposed to be a majority of István Lados and his accomplices, András Őri manipulated, with the latter according to our information, responsible for the Constitution of the relevant reports. 
One of the aims of Lados ' "fact-finding tour" was a local beer. 
As two of the contract and co bills issued in 2003, is to take the catering company, the neunzigköpfige group of club Biztos bewirtet Pont Egyesület. 
But now the head of the company, would have such a large group of not suit them all at once in the local. 
Given a different account in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért also pointed to serious form and content errors. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which only has three room and no more than ten people providing at the same time, according to the account contained 130 guests. 
The fantasy of the accounting counterfeiters were apparently as no borders, when it came to the Pigal Kft., a catering company, in its accounting documents from the Jobb Jövőért customers and Hoppá according to prosecutor not to be seen. 
As business leaders Győző Farkas, told the hvg.hu it was immediately clear that it was counterfeit documents, as he has been presented by the public prosecutor's office during a consultation documents. 
"Our firms name and the tax number were on the wrong stamp appropriate". 
And, aside from form mistakes was also wrong, the fact that the operation is to have pulverized one hundred people after they have a total of 11 room impossible so many people place. 
Also on the bill have been cited lunches, the restaurant was not for some time longer in operation. 
The inspired accounting counterfeiters have also failed to check that the perceived Budapest travel agency of them targeted exclusively trips abroad, and so they have Hungary trips on the Barzahlungs account, which spoke of accounting practice the firm also. 
As has been known as part of the investigation, they have also on the bills the value-added tax, even though travel agency services, which are on a country outside the EU, VAT free. 
The level of VAT was generally from the hotel to four Révfülöp Kft. issued to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért bills wrong, since the operation rather than only 25 set off 15 % VAT also exclusively by the staff, mechanised issued bills were counterfeit documents, however, hand in writing. 
Another mistake, "the Rechnungslegern" was, was that they had stated in a case of "transport of goods" as output, even though the company specialized in investment advice will not be offered to the public prosecutor's office said. 
Another form of false accounting errors - format, false stamp - was thanks to the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont issued bills could be exposed as a fraud. 
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sport camps Kunfehértó, whose beteuerten business leaders who never issued bills. 
A "mistake" is undermining the counterfeiters in the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this society was at the time (2001) just eaten in dissolution, when the group Fiatal Városért Egyesület there - the mass manager was therefore not even issued bills. 
Deliberately falsified 
The other bomber group the accounting people was well aware that they would have to fictitious accounts. 
At the request of the Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták Fiatal, the Foundation has Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, for a total of HUF $ 4 million. 
According to the indictment, the executive director of the Kft. Collab by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, the exhibition persuaded the fictional bills. 
Now in declining winding up Biogate Kft. will award and Co have worked together, in 2003 the Ltd the Foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület clubs and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with counterfeit bills in the overall value of 5 million HUF supplies have not services rendered. 
But there were nor payments, because the scores immediately after their exhibition were cancelled, people in their documents, however, have failed. 
The third group the accounting bomber who covers people directly with the defendants. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian business leader of the delta Trió Kft., a resident in Budapest, but not auffindbaren fuel and Fahrzeughandelsfirma. 
The company is in the period from October to December 2005 several bills on the sale of EDV-Komponenten in the total value of approximately 18 million HUF issued. 
According to the investigative body is the cash investment since 14 September 2005 in liquidation Kft. from Kiskunhalas functions as buyer of these bills. 
Business leaders firm was a Rumanian, the firms also documents should be Iván Kubatov delivered between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information, has issued Kubatov during the investigation, bills on behalf of the GmbH. to the clubs Atlasz and Hoppá, and Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and their value even to have. 
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. firms as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. of Romanian bricklayers to Iván Kubatovs founded express request. 
In reality, however, none of these firms was active, which, according to Angeklagtem was due to the lack of contracts. 
Yet he could benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplices, of lawyer Zsolt Szente, was charged with the preparation of the new companies documents, he has in the name of scores firms with contract issued in connection expressed clubs, such as in Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
A total of Kubatov to 15 bills in the overall value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies cash investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos investment and Linaxtrade have issued to the organizations. 
The public prosecutor's office estimates that Kubatov could have each 10 % of the accounting sum and the value-added tax. 
Kubatov even the firm Szi-Beri Bt. abused for the exhibition of fictional accounts - in this case, the bills have been settled the application from Biztos Pont. 
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért have their applications in January 2006 at the non-profit organization the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA"). 
Both received the 500,000 Forints, as compared to the magnitude, have used these amounts but purpose. 
In order to cover it up, they have the TMA five fictitious accounts of the Kft. Works team. 
These scores were, incidentally, in the raid on the offices of Árpád Kemecsei in the education ministry. 
In the negotiations is now by some defendants with a confession about the approach of the Court of counterfeiting, as they were before the public prosecutor's office,. 
A sensation could be, if the main defendants János contract decides to a comprehensive confession. 
His previous claims were less detailed, and although he had already promised on several occasions to report about all his confession is still pending. 
The question is whether this is in its interest, whether the Socialists a pact with him on the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by 50 million HUF have concluded, and whether premium in exchange is prepared to accept the responsibility. 
But it is quite possible that contract were now the "insulted" plays after his requests to alleviate the imprisonment and house arrest have fallen on deaf ears. 
While other criminals with economic crimes caused far greater damage and these have not paid at large, or at least are under house arrest, was awarded that possibility. 
The psychology of the Überbietens - or why we are willing to pay more 
At an auction buyers tend to spend more, and to exaggerate the Feilgebotene. 
It is now managed Neuro-anatomists and economic researchers of the University of New York to discover the neurologisch-ökonomischen bases this known and seemingly irrational behavior. 
According to a published study in Science " magazine, want to give the people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, not beaten, and therefore are willing to pay even inflated prices. 
Researchers have tried to explore the neurological system this "game" with experimental auctions. 
A group of volunteers lottery should play, while the other action in a games, took part in both cases were active brain regions of the subjects functional magnetischer resonance (fMRI). 
In both games could win the participants money, however, it has been measured increased activity of the Striatum, a set of below the Gehirnrinde, losers of auction, in which the bidding of the opponent plays a major role. 
In addition to many other functions is this brain region for the "reward" of the nervous system. 
The researchers said the increase in prices could be by avoiding overreaction of the Striatums explain. 
In order to support their argument that economists have also studies in the group of researchers to Nachverfolgung of the money. 
In this case, three groups against a bid partners under different conditions. 
The control group was told the true value of the product, then they have their operations. 
Another group has been promised beyond 15 dollar reward in the case that as a winner out of the game. 
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which also were lost in the event of a lost game. 
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, only that the emphasis in on the profits, while the other was on the losers. 
As evidence of the expressed Neuro-anatomists hypothesis, but the members of the "losers"'s group to higher operations prepared than those in the control - or the "profit" group. 
" These results are none of the previous economic theory. 
They have looked at auctions behavior so far, only with the joy of the profits or risk avoidance. 
The contradiction between these two theories was thanks to the neurological imaging techniques dissolved, so that we now have a third statement of Europe, " said Andrew Schotter, a professor of business law school of the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: when is to go to the doctor? 
Around the world suffer roughly half a billion people from chronic hepatitis B or C, and Hungary will this chronic liver disease gelistet among the leading causes of death. 
The number of infected patients treated in this country one hundred thousand estimated, however, only seven thousand, which is that patients often do not know that they are infected. 
Hepatitis is the collective term for unleashed by various viruses, infectious liver disease. 
The symptoms are often similar to liver inflammation and yellow are often, but the pathogens are different, and the disease from one another. 
Depending on the virus's spread hepatitis viruses on two different species: hepatitis A and E by the Verdauungstrakt (for example, through contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D the viruses through blood and other body liquids (such as sperm, Scheidensekret or spittle). 
In any case, passengers will be a vaccine against the virus A and B recommended against the C virus, there is no vaccine. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A show around two, three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are in general of illness, weakness, stomach pain and vomit. 
After that, the Addiction yellow on the skin, and in the eyes of the chair is bright, dark urine, and the recovery could take up to two for three weeks. 
Worldwide every year, about 1 million people in the caused by hepatitis B, far more serious illnesses such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. 
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten of infected patients in medication. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. 
Most of those infected do not even know about their illness, because the pathogen destroyed liver cells are both subtle - in many cases, the first symptoms after 20-30 years. 
It is therefore timely prevention, such as regular monitoring investigations, is essential. 
There are three groups in which this disease often: those who have before 1991 a blood transfusion to undergo drug addicts, and Tätowierte. 
Now, it is estimated that the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide, to 200 million. 
Since the disease is already in a routine lab study tracked, it is advisable to seek at the first signs of unknown origin, the family doctor. 
In time, the disease is curable, the virus cannot be eradicated, thereby averting the risk of infection and prevent the development of cancer. 
Of the 30 September is the International Day of hepatitis, 2004 for the first time of patients Represents around the world. 
The aim of the action, it is the awareness of this virus caused chronic liver inflammation to strengthen its creation and the importance of early detection. 
Believers have less pain? 
How new research has shown that the religious belief as a kind of "analgesics also acts" that have made it easier to the death of Catholic martyrs. 
Scientists at Oxford University have studied an interesting experiment carried out: it was the extent to which the belief in God, feel the pain of the people affected, the British newspaper reported "Telegraph". 
In the wake of the more bizarre investigation received the 12 believers and atheists electric shocks while they studied a painting of the mother of God. 
As the results showed the believers were able to eliminate the bulk of the pain. 
Using a brain scan showed technology could even be shown that Catholics were able to activate the part of her brain, which is responsible for the pain regulation. 
The study was the first in a research project as well as scientists also philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University to take part. 
In an attempt has been the subjects of a funkelndes equipment linked to the left hand, which electric shocks. 
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: a picture of the mother of God, painted of Sassoferrato, in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vincis "lady with the Hermelin." 
The researchers had hoped that the sight of young wife Maria among believers, a kind of religious Trance would provoke while they identified Vincis picture, because it is hardly different from the other paintings and has been treated as reassuring. 
People spent a half an hour in a MRI scanners, and received in this period, a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should either the religious or the other paintings. 
Catholics reported they had at the sight of the mother of God "in security" felt as if they would be "surrounded by," and they would have felt "peace and quiet." 
During the Betrachtens of religious Gemäldes they have over 12 % reported less pain than if they Leonardos work had in mind. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, also attempt took part, said it could also similar effects with other strong acting images in the atheists, you would have to find just the photograph. 
"We must find a picture, which very positive sentiments, such as a mother or father," the psychologist. 
The anglikanische Tom Bishop Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
"The practice of the faith should change our personality, and in many cases," Wright. 
After this excellent results, the only question is what effect a Madonna picture Leonardos or other similar Malers on the pain regulation of believers. 
Would the high-quality young wife Maria still achieve better results? 
You are what you mitteilst on you 
At its tenth birthday celebrations, Google is fair to say: it is in the pockets of the people to find just as their minds in the sky: they know where people have spent their holidays to what doctors they go and what they moved. 
And still not be enough, according to Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google. 
In the direction of skeptics who plagued by Orwellian nightmare visions, he can do: they would miss the very essence of the web 2 point 0. 
In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main objective of Google it is even more personal data about users to collect, and so the original purpose of the firm to get closer to that "all the information in the world". 
Schmidt said Google was after ten years of work changing world still only at the beginning of the information collection. 
He asked for the status quo in five years, said Schmidt: wanted, Google would be able to answer questions such as, "what am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "what job fits really to me?", but software programs are not yet in a position to do so, because they do not know enough about the user. 
Not all Internet users are aware that their Internet research the search terms would be recorded, and the IP addresses was sought, and the visited pages. 
For example, two years ago introduced "Personalized Search" allowing the visitors to its own search to store and later resort, so that the net and later, generated much more precise and is based on the same logic the so-called "Recommendations," with whom the system tailor-made recommends products and services because of the previous preferences. 
Ask the users, however, what happens in the event of a data abuse - "if you check what I am" - some are worried the Google-Datenmonopols. 
In most cases, but it is rather represented by the firm, potential power terrifying, and less the sense of guilt or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rebellion against the power, that is for many Internet users. 
But it is a proven fact that the search terms not only stored, but also in the occasion case will be passed on to third parties, and in these cases, law, there is no protection for the individual rights of the Internet Users. 
A prime example of this was recently action against pedophilia in Brazil, the Brazilian government in which Google überreichte the information gathered by the Community site called "Orkut," and also an identification of the Pädophilien enabled. 
Personal rights users concerned but still aufatmen in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF successfully against the FBI drew in court: thus Google can also be in the future, not the constitution forced the FBI information on secret question. 
(. However, the federal government has successfully understood the publication of 50,000 Webadressen and 1,000 search with reference to the years ago passed Youth Protection Act, but it has been denied the list of individual users, or their Web - and search term list two months retroactively.) 
Google's image remains so controversial: those who scorn their personal data not be issued because it by the use of the Google services the loss of their private and make-up of fear, the company with the conservative performing firms due indignation. 
However, the American is "Geek-Kultur", which is present in many countries, and enthusiastic computer fans, unites activists, and users, the next generation of "coolen entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, that is thanks to Windows market leader, even if the two are fighting for the same goal. 
A possible reason for this is that Google is its users, in contrast to Microsoft no identification codes, and his services available free of charge, so that an open constantly updated source code and programming package far more attractive, young and cool appear to be the official practices of the software giant. 
On the other hand, through the Geeks look the problematic relationship of individual rights and crack down the Internet knife - a relationship that is particularly in the past few years, thanks to the concept of "web 2 point 0" in the center. 
The "web 2 point 0" it is, in fact, nothing more than collaboration, in other words, the users leave deliberately traces and use the available channels of communication, and even if the individual proportions are different, the main thing remains the same: to show in public. 
The average young people can at the same time, several Community portals manage its profile - from Facebook on Xanga, can this through other services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm link, and all of this, after all, in a Nachverfolgungs system such as Friend Feed or Blip.fm. Moreover, it can lead blogs, which are the latest photo galleries automatically on geostet Flickr and Picasa. 
And a series of other demonstrates exemplary cases: Betrachten the party photos last night the girlfriend soon, with whom rubbing their disloyal friend has fired, or the staff, because he makes in his blog all too honest his anger at the corporate governance air - one thing is certain: the word "privacy" has now been interpreted entirely new. 
Who is an online life, which is what he is price - as in, for example, could be the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth. 
And anyone who tried to keep secret, or even to circumvent the Google monopoly, can do that - such as with Scroogle, a Tool, which is on the search engine Google to stick, but deliberately no traces. 
Not a few people register deliberately not at Community sides, so that they are not found, but also the online applications from Google, such as text processing and graphically tools and RSS-Feeds, deal with alternative versions, which are bound by no huge server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile from users. 
Public opinion is waiting, however, contained, Google shows her true colors. 
With its current value of $ 156 billion, the company is even before IBM (140 billion USD), Intel ($ 124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($ 110 billion), the advertising land of AdWords and AdSense threaten the revenue of the advertising agencies, and the ever faster introduced services not only Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. 
Critical spectator but also the disturbing subject a Pole: the company has led a protest of the staff rejected entirely after the fees of their own firms have been doubled kindergarten, also said the management, frequent meals of the staff was too costly. All of this but seems downright mild against the fact that Google in 2006, even before the Chinese government to its knees, and was in agreement with an agreement that all dissident hits, or those who violate the good taste, filtered out. 
The internal rules of the group is that in advance will be no new service advertised, but only if they could already is available, but the events in the coming months and years some strong intended to completely change: while some believe Google's book and magazine scan showed - or archiving project now take proportions that the company would soon with the Supreme Court to address, so others are much more because of the system "Health worried" that the establishment of full health profile on the basis of diseases, doctors and problems. 
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database of the next generation the Sci-Fi authors is already the stuff, "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow described in great Orwellian fashion a future in which a man, thanks to Google personal data terrifying nahbar. 
Two young people to help the double murderer of Ózd when traces of eliminating 
In connection with the double murder of Ózd has two police interrogated young people suspected of being in the removal of the leads have helped told the speaker of the Borsod police Commissariat on Tuesday. 
Young people were geständig, now they are accused of aid. 
According to the news agency MTI are two girls who defend themselves at large. 
Aid is being threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years. 
The suspect to the double murder of Ózd, a living 23-jähriger local man was arrested on Sunday in custody. 
The man is under urgent suspicion from money hungry deliberately killed several people. 
During the course of the investigation, it has emerged that the 23-year-old a 53-jährigen due to a larger amount of money. 
The suspects did not pay its debts, however, so he cajoled murdered his creditors last Wednesday on a site in Ózd, where he him and his nine-year-old daughter.

Together with experts examined the police Tatwaffe as well as the circumstances of their use. 
Warsaw Stock Exchange purchasing sets offer for Prague Stock Exchange 
Some 200 million euros, or 5 billion kroner Czech has the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100 % purchasing the stock packages the Prague Stock Exchange. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reiterated the offer, which had the Poland, despite the fact that they have been used by the Czechs as a potential owner of its stock market. 
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange entirely belongs to the state. 
99 % of the stock is in the hands of the Polish state, however, more than 60 % of papers, wants to sell in the coming months. 
After news of the Czech newspaper "E15" includes the Offerte Poland was the highest purchase price ever for the Prague Stock Exchange. 
As the newspaper reports have until now, the Vienna stock exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German stock market offers. 
Petr Koblic, leader of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that all the interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owners, and he joined from that in the future even could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange. 
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange on 5-10 billion kronor. 
According to the agreement, shareholders could be sold 90 % of the shares. 
Most owners of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance investment bank with a 25 % participation, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank 14.7 and the Tigers holding Fourtou's S.a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent. 
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers 
In their the exacerbated devoted to international financial crisis commentary spoke on Tuesday, some leading European already pages of the "second 9 / 11". 
The global financial disaster we owe the American president, said some "la Repubblica" - the President was not even in his own party for the bill to a should bring some relief in the appalling situation... 
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the heavy billion investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to talk of a "second 9 / 11". 
Parts of the press in Madrid locate the scapegoat, also in Washington. 
According to the "El Mundo" is the lack of political leadership to blame, that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse. 
The American financial system threatens more collapsing, and the whole world will suffer. 
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now threatens after the vote in the Congress, the danger that Washington has no political funds for crisis management. 
Depends on the world economy in the air, and it comes at a time when one of the largest transformations of the history of capitalism. 
The threat can no longer ignore the Geneva " day scoreboard says. 
Nor could save, although some states their faltered of troubled financial institutions rescue packages available, and the banks with the taxpayers " money before the bankruptcy. 
But it will help a domino effect and it even more banks failure, then neither further injections of funds, other emergency measures. 
In the long run, the EU member states would have to jump over their shadow and centralised control over the money markets. 
Alone on Monday more than EUR 100 billion paid out in faltering financial institutions, reminds the Vienna "of the standard". In addition, the newspaper, which are always realistic concern that after the Americans now, European taxpayers would be a little deeper into their pockets to take out of the crisis. 
So far, the EU has not seriously with the crisis, as a tsunami will blow on the old continents. 
The "savior", not immediately, with several hundred billions of euros "wedeln", but it would be advisable to maintain, in which case it would be reasonable to see taxpayers ' money to prevent even greater damage. 
Imitiert intelligent car the flight of the Hummel 
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to accident prevention, if not the obstacle to imitate sensors from the nature? 
For example, the bees. 
At the CEATEC Japan was presented a striking project, in which the Nissan engineers from Hummeln in creating new accident were inspired vermeidender systems. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University of Nissan has managed biomimetische system of car robotic humans type BR23C built a mini car, equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. 
In the air, each bee is their own oval "private sector," said our own "shield" is very similar to Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for Technologie-PR research and development of the exhibition. 
The composite eye of the bee that can see in every direction, and in a corner of more than 300 degrees, playing an important role. 
The function of the composite eye to imitate the researchers, the idea of the laser controlled distance diameter. 
This identified obstacles before the BR23C in an angle field of 180 degrees within 2 metres, calculated their distances and sends signals to the board Mikroprozessor, immediately avoided a collision process. 
The barrier will be registered in a split second, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees by the tyre revolve around the corner. 
In contrast to previous systems will take place this purely instinctively maneuvers. 
"If it were not so, the car robots could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the "mobility Laboratory (" and the Autoroboter-Projektes. 
The system must respond instinctively and immediately, because this technology to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a shift in the accidents still considered inevitable. 
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if they avoid other bees. 
And in a split second. 
But can the branching out, in contrast to the bees, not upwards, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction of the Wendbarkeit the tyre. 
While the bees infinitely many options open in order to avoid other bees, researchers could only in car robot is the central movement, or of speeding up and Abbremsens. 
The BR23C Lithium-Polymerbatterien are easier and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer life than traditional Lithium-Ionenbatterien. 
Andoh said it is on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of data, and even less to the ability to store them. 
This device must process per second only a few inputs and respond to them. 
It does not have to store or on the basis of previous exercises produce an intuitive, logical response, so that it constantly just a handful of KB Memory. 
There is no need for gigabits - and serious megabyte Memories. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate Kollisionsvermeidungstechnologie, according to estimates by Nissan in the next ten years series will be in production. 
Another application could find the technology in the GPS-Satelliten navigation by the drivers aware of barriers around, and it leads to target. 
A name for the sündteure child 
Is now the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar serious legislative rescue package, which will be in phases and on the purchase of bad loans from banks. 
In the first round will be half of the money spent. 
In a session, which ended on Saturday after midnight local time east coast, the congressmen after mehrtägigen debates to reach agreement on the 700-Milliarden-Dollar heavy rescue package, of course, Reuters reported. 
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President in the US Congress, and said the agreement only on paper. 
The compromise reached on the bailout backed both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the outcome: the programme will be effective and efficient, but we must do even more rumzureißen. According to Pelosi if it were not for the rescue of Wall Street, but the helm of the economy. 
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, so Washington time Sunday evening 8.00 p.m. (Central European time Monday 2.00 a.m.), but has no high on the stock. 
On Monday, is the first house on the draft legislation to stabilize the economy in 2008, it is the Senate's turn. 
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday evening with Pelosi, and the White House welcomed the news of the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress achieved during the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to protect our to stabilize markets and our economy, said Tony Fratto, a spokesman for the White House. 
The program, however, deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush administration, according to which the $ 700 billion in bad for the purchase, with contaminated credit securities should be spent. 
In a first tranche is to be spent a maximum of half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages, with 250 billion are immediately available, after the Congress as expected on Monday, will vote on the issue. This sum for the purchase of contaminated credit worse securities are spent, and the other $ 100 billion, should decide the President. 
The program will be reviewed by a own Commission, also a member of the President of the Federal Reserve. 
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of Congress. 
In the spirit of the law the Treasury can also apply a combined tactics: it can at the same time, bad loans, mortgages, and with mortgages purchased securities, or other "toxic" loans. 
As competent people reported the ministry can purchase in both auction, as well as directly. 
The law allows the affected firms in an insurance program, in which the Treasury guarantees the disturbing funds, and the company expected damage pay such fees. 
Henry Paulsen said: the law defines the necessary resources so that up to 700 billion dollars as emergency aid for the American financial system can be made available, it was worse for the large-scale purchase resources of their insurance, or to avoid a systemic risk, which is triggered by the collapse of a major money Institute. 
We take the necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared to introduce the legislation as soon as it was signed, so Paulson. 
The bosses of troubled and now reliant on government aid banks can, however, expect that their self-handling mentioned in the Übersee-Slang unceremoniously "golden hand shaking," will be shortened by the government. 
A reduction in the wages will only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury aushilft. 
The reduction basically means that if the Department obtains in an auction, the "golden hand shaking taxed" will be deported, unless the outgoing banking chief in the pensions. 
In the case of a direct buying the bad loans, the government will aggressively involved to ensure that managers salaries not be exaggerated. 
The picture also heard that the existing treaties Golden hand shaking not be changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements so that the more people to participate in the programme. 
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managers salaries will be regulated by law, the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee measure. 
The state wins rights of participation in the participating banks, so that the risk of falls for taxpayers, because they can also join as soon as it is the economy, and with it the rescued Bank better. 
The draft law stipulates that the President of the Congress over the next five years must submit a proposal, such as the taxpayers get back their lost money from the financial sector. 
There was, however, on both sides, skeptics who in relation to the plan have expressed their doubts. 
This is not what the American people expect us to the plan to protect the taxpayers ' money by no means, the California Republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said the measures were driven by the same people who are for the collapse of Wall Street.

In Austria, Haider and co ready to govern to prevent a rot-schwarze coalition. 
The spiegel.de mirror () 
In the online edition of the left US-located German news magazine Franz Walter analysing the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavaria's revolution their fathers vertilgt." 
According to the renowned political theorists, began the erosion of the CSU long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took his offices. 
The Christian social Bavaria have renewed for decades - now turn the modern citizens of them. 
The eras collapse is also a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel. 
Quite surprising the disaster was not the CSU, but on Sunday is something to an end, however, already quite materialised exactly ten years: the undoubted hegemony, a state party

SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann reiterated its desire to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible - in some states, and in the social partnership, this is already the case. 
The question of whether he could envisage a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP-Chef as Vice-Chancellor, Faymann left open. 
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer-Kurs voters voted out. 
A repeat this direction would not in question. 
Molterer has, however, careful responds to red bids. 
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said that if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal concern of the Austrian People's Party. 
Whether his party in opposition, or in the coalition, is now completely open, and these issues should be discussed ÖVP-intern. 
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider was open in all directions. 
"In order to prevent rot-schwarz, we are prepared to take government responsibility," Haider. 
Járóka: the vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken 
Today the European summit in Paris started on equal opportunities, which will this year by the EU presidential country, France. 
In her speech addressed to the plenary Járóka, made Fidesz Members of the European People's Party, especially to the attention of educational segregation, since this is one of the most serious violations of law, the Roma children, moreover, this is the biggest obstacle for their application need. 
The high-level conference was opened by the French social and employment minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French presidency and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil organisations from the equal opportunities. 
As the press office of MEPs the Fidesz reports Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in Jobsuche, the Roma primarily because of their low levels of education that would be displaced from the labour market. 
"The overwhelming majority of Roma youth has no means of education, and, thanks to a bad primary education can achieve only a small part of them a university degree." 
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education is a basic human right, which has a key role to play in other people's rights. 
Investment in early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU member states. 
The MPs believe it is important that these links a broad circle - Roma and not Roma will be aware of this. 
Because the sooner a Roma pupils school begins to rise even more to his chances, productive to become a member of the labour market ; and income and sales taxes they should make their contribution to the national spending. 
"As citizens, must be safeguarded the Roma the right to quality education, the bad and segregierte teaching must be stopped" - so Járóka,. 
As she said, is a common one, and action oriented actions of the European Union needed to speed up the Desegregationsprozess education. This is the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives. 
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and Roma children the democratic ways to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóka. 
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, will be held the summit a year with the aim of creating a unique forum for the progress Bringung the objectives of the equality of opportunity and freedom from discrimination on the European, but also the national level, in the sense of "European Year of equality of opportunity." 
CSU: mercy on time 
At the end of October, will be decided on the fate of the fallen Duos Huber Beckstein 
Despite the election debacle on a plate once bore no heads, were at the top of the Bavarian CSU postponed the staff debates. 
Party chief Erwin Huber, and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the only question is how long this mercy. 
The fate of the tandems after the disastrous 17-prozentigen voting loss will be decided at the last October weekend at the extraordinary Party Congress. 
But the much gescholtene duo left already hints that it does not want to put on their bellies. 
They want to ensure that the angry group and appease the party base, a day after the "Bavarian tsunami", with the loss of the absolute majority demanded personal consequences. 
Five years ago, admittedly, under the leadership of his career the height Edmund Stoiber - reached the Christian Social Union 60.7 %. But now, a year after the coup against Stoiber they could only ensure 43.4 percentage of the vote. 
The CSU was 46 for years, "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria, the 18 per cent of the German GDP. 
The Conservatives are the dominant force in the southern province of important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in the future in a coalition. 
The first sign of internal party will restructuring of the Hubers potential successor, Vice President and federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer also involved in the fact-finding team, which leads with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "free voters" exploratory talks about a possible Munich coalition. 
It is equally an irony of fate that with the list of "free voters" those Gabriele Pauli in the legislative, whose against Stoiber the incidence Huber Beckstein duo first exploited the abzuservieren determined politician mercilessly. 
Now the CSU-Führung focusing all its efforts on the stabilization Becksteins. 
In this transitional process will Stoiber, so far the strings from behind the scenes, an active part. The former prime minister and called CSU-Vorsitzender 28 September, the "most bitter day of his political career." 
On Monday, Huber, made a few toxic comments in the direction of the CDU, in his view, deserved the CSU far more support from the sister party. 
Others interpreted CSU-Politiker defeat as a signal to the CDU, and hence to Angela Merkel. 
The CSU, the 2005 national level much has contributed to the success, not with a common effort can back on its feet, Merkel after the federal elections in September 2009 will not again be Chancellor. 
Merkel from their disappointment at the fiasco has made no secret of the fact, believes that the loss of terrain of CSU will not have a negative effect on the grand coalition in Berlin. 
But what is relatively: the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats, however, is continuing. 
18,6 percentage with the SPD reached their so far, the best result in Bavaria since 1946. 
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0 
In Sunday's elections has managed no member of the opposition in the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers say this is the prosperity and stability in the country by Alexander Lukashenko, the OECD, however, believed to illegality in the counting of the votes. 
The OECD, the from 43 countries sent 450 observers, the election has not recognised. 
De legislature of 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates plays for decades without opposition, but the unified Democratic forces under the name "" (ODS) harboring other party before the yesterday's elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, the renewed the Ugly elections and, thanks to a constitutional amendment 2006 presidential mandate for the fourth time, this time a few members of the opposition in Parliament, "would allow". 
That is why the ODS even by the previously proposed boycotts. 
Ukraine will ever more dependent on thanks to the rising prices of natural gas imports from Russia economically. For the relief of the price increases have even been loans, and the country has the disposal of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country to the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition, so the hope Ukraine wants to improve its relations with the EU, after Lukashenko and other senior politicians because of the as anti-democratic classified political system in the EU travel ban. 
Made for a temporary relaxation of the evaluation report the elections of the OECD, the emphasis was more on the positive movements, rather than to the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections. 
However, criticized the rapid OECD report on Monday, the campaign - so the opposition should not occur in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition in the counting of votes was not allowed to be present. 
The opposition, despite all this can see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been about freed and Minsk is even smaller confrontation with Moscow prepared by continue to the recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, the Ukraine on paper is a Föderativ state, the two areas for a month, seen as independent. 
"We have two steps forward and backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Russia and the EU White has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our story. 
According to the opposition candidates in the presidential elections of 2006, is a continuation of desirable, even though "the powerful afraid to let even a member of the opposition in the parliament." 
The opposition has no plans to protest action in the face of the results, but rather the need for economic reform to the voters. 
"We have many problems - the opposition newspapers have printed in Russia, the local authorities in the distribution of obstacles in the way, but I still see that more and more people are supporting the change, even the older," Milinkevich said in reference to that not even the most supported section of the pensioners is in agreement with the Lukashenko regime, whose sole credit for the manufacture of social security. 
"Thanks to the debt of the country, and the rise in the trade deficit, it is just a matter of time before the silence of a peaceful gemahnende Justice" social security "begins to break down," Milinkievitch. 
Unlike the opposition politicians, Russian observers have the elections as a democratically. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the news agency Ria Novosti: "people think that the deeds, and not the words." the absence of the opposition, therefore, is a testimony to the maturity of the Belarusian voters. 
Brunetta: "from now on, before the gefrühstückt work" 
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi, there is drehbare doors for the import and exits of officials. 
Today, the measure is against those Schlau Meier enter into force only label and then during the working time to drink a cup of coffee. 
The new "Anti-Faulpelz-Gesetz" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the minister for public administration and Mauro Masi, General Secretary of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers. 
" > " Drehbare doors are a means to increase the labor efficiency by a higher attendance rate and more services, " Minister Brunetta. 
" Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency. 
This is reformism, " Brunetta underscores yet again. 
With the Palazzo Chigi ends the establishment in all buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers. 
Masi says this: "the choice of drehbaren doors is of great symbolic value." 
The officials there has been no resistance, the Secretary-General assured: "this process was supported by all cooperation came from all sides." 
All in all, there is now no breakfast during the working time ; with Kaffe or Crois Sant. 
Advises Brunetta's here with a smile: "a good looks cappuccino at 7.00 a.m. miracle". 
During a meeting of the Oberausschusses public administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione) 
Of Rome said the minister, that "the Abwesenheiten within three months of civil servants have reduced to 50 %, that is 60,000 people per year more at work here." 
He adds that it is necessary to enhance the efficiency of public administration Italy 
"Their wage dynamics - the minister - were in the last 8-10 years twice as large as the private sector and far above the rate of inflation". 
Now have thousands of officials to the Brunetta decree within the framework of the Codacons supported appeal. 
" During the minister for public services with figures on less high profile Absenzen at work - so the consumer is growing central - the people of the ' operating some lazy people constantly '. 
In fact, have thousands of correct and valuable of public servants together to the contrary to legal standards of the decree to declare war. " 
In particular, is being challenged before the regional administrative court (TAR) for additional financial compensation for work-related illness ; so the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick Arbeiternehmers, while what monitoring visits can be made, and other aspects of the innovations of the minister. 
Napolitano, "preventing accidents at work is crucial" 
Happen every day, 2500 workplace accidents in Italy, three people die and 27 life terms remain invalids. 
For the year 2007, the data confirm the Inail (nazionale Istituto contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) that the deadly accidents around 1200. 
These figures illustrate the seriousness of a phenomenon, which almost twice as many deaths caused by murders. 
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of the 58th Italy's national day for the victims of accidents at work, in order to draw the attention of the social institutions and the media on this tragic situation. 
"The disturbing, widespread Anmil data and confirm the tragic news these days, as crucial to the issue of prevention is in the workplace." the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in its communication to the President of the Amil (nazionale Associazione mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state, his "big appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers to aid for the families of the victims and to raise awareness of public opinion". 
"A empörtes" Basta "has elevated this even repeat ; understandable when tragedies, as measured by its magnitude, some cyclone in the media and sympathy to the public. But the everyday reality, often with dramatic events in its own momentum." 
Napolitano does not hide that, "there are in any case, also a resource problem: it is crucial that will be invested in education and information." 
A special importance to the many initiatives for a more direct realisation in school framework on the part of the young people who feed the world of work. 
It is our duty to call attention to this phenomenon, and not divert attention from its social seriously. We must improve a legislative norm in force. 
For its part, has been the president of the chamber, Gianfranco Fini stresses "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths - to be an urgent social emergency, which will force the conscience of us all insulted and all the institutions to firm rules work that have the goal of the problem to put an end to". 
"The data seem to accidents at work to signal a slight improvement, but this does not rule out that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," stresses President of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want this" positive trend "means less attention precisely what caused the tragedy." 
" How believe that in fact is doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents. You can by various actions to fight against. 
More checks and inspections we think are necessary so – Mercandelli ; but also stronger measures to educate workers already in the start of the school. " 
" One more effort is needed, he added, for the communication and the awareness of the public opinion. 
Above all, though, there is something bigger a sense of responsibility on the part of the employer a phenomenon, which represents a social emergency asked. " 
Mercandelli was also on "the gradual deterioration of protection for accident victims to speak" and condemned the "abolition of the social system, against which we fight in the last few years." 
"The goal is, therefore, the workers a guarantee to covered by insurance, so that the fate of the victim of a work accident will not be voluntary or accidental donation from time to time by a legislator be decided on." 
Mp3-Player under indictment: risk of hearing impairment 
Loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3-Player to hear can lead to permanent hearing damage. 
It asks the European Commission, which in a in Brussels today report widespread the opinion of the scientific committee Csrseri (on the current and recently identified health risks) quoted the EU. 
"From the report – so it is loud, in a comment – it is clear that 5-10 % of those, at least for five years a week longer than an hour a day listening to music with portable music devices, the permanent loss of their risk hearing." 
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually portable music devices and mobile phones to high volume, to make their voice heard without knowing it becomes irreversibly damage," Meglena Kuneva. 
" From the scientific diseases – it is part of the I – shows a clear risk to act swiftly. 
What really counts, it is to raise awareness among consumers, and this information to make public good. 
We must once again review given this scientific knowledge the existing control systems so that they are completely effective and to keep up with the new technology step ". 
Brussels had asked the independent scientific committee, given the widespread use of portable music devices among young people. 
"The scientists - including the communication of the EU - confirm that it is right to worry, and that the I Commission, together with the other Eu-Mitgliedern and stakeholders will now examine the necessary measures in order to better children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar equipment to protect." 
There already exists at the moment a European standard that could be the level of noise portable music devices to 100 decibels limited. The concern about the damage from a large noise pollution. 
You can limit the damage, in which you solutions, such as the reduction in the volume and the length of the noise suspension. 
In its report, the scientific committee of the I pointed out that, if the users of portable music devices just five hours in the noisy week (louder than 89 decibels), listening to music, so that the legal limits were already crossed on the maximum noise levels in the workplace. 
Those who music exceed that limit, the complete risk loss of hearing within five years. 
So concerns 5-10 % of users of these devices, which can be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the I appreciated. 
Roma, Alemanno gives the go-ahead to the "Commission on the future of the capital," 
Today, we are starting to in March there will be over in June stock. 
This is the end of the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the future of the capital, Rome. " the Commission has taken this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla-Thermen. 
In six months the President Marzano, and the other 49 members of the Commission, the top draw lines for Rome. 
Once the project will be completed, the city - and the town council to assess the analyses and projects to be able to present in June in a position to be the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Kapitols and Mayoress Gianni Alemanno. 
" The Commission is completely independent, and all the political, social, and cultural views are represented in it, " - Alemanno. " they will darbringen proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders of the city - and the local council. 
There is not a new division of powers, the desire to have a place where you can develop a great project for Rome. 
In March of their task will be completed and the Commission will dissolve, a project of this kind have a particular end. 
In June, announced the Lord Mayor, we will present the strategic plan, in which we will use the work undertaken by the Commission. " 
Who is the competence of the Commission, as their opinion ermangele binding, the replied Alemanno: " everything depends on the work, which will make the Commission and the quality of their proposals. 
If, as in France, the Attali Commission provides quality results – and this will certainly in Rome, will be the case – then fundamentally their contribution. 
Too often the policy with the day-to-day problems and emergencies occur from time to time. 
We want to, by contrast, have a longer period of time, in order to seriously in a deeper perspective to the development of Rome and the future of the city work. " 
The Lord Mayor of Rome is very important to clarify the following "the Commission is neither a useless facility a wreck: it is totally free costs, it will cost the Roman citizens not one cent, and it will bring us food for thought. It will employ the best brains the capital". 
According to Mr Alemanno "there is a need to have a strategic plan, which does not sealed is static, in order to enable our city a qualitative leap - they really need to do so, and a common step in the future". 
A future, so the Lord Mayor of Rome, " not just in the current limit municipal boundaries, but will continue to look, " not only in terms of Rome role as metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. " 
Obama – the first anti-American President? A statement 
A well-known American politicians, are seen as independent, wrote: " Barack Obama will be the second anti American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, the dezimierte by his decisions, the economy of the United States and the befeindeten Islam relations with the used (and still does today as a private citizen. " 
The attacks on Obama are increasingly intense, especially now, where the approaching elections. 
A lady from Miami wrote in a website: " this person is full of ambitions. 
Obama is very brazenly: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation, which has a total of two black governors and five black senators seen! ". 
They have these attacks but not a great deal to say ; it is racist attacks and not answer the question of the voters: he will be a good President? And then there is also the polls ; all say that Obama will win by a large margin. 
In this case, people are there, with the heart and not talk to the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in the editorial: it was only in the election booth we will know who the real American patriot will be his voice. 
This is a mentality of the United States, which has been up to least hidden. 
Says, "what do you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our Kreuchen whether Obama or McCain." 
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will move out of America. 
Something you never before heard – only now, when the success of the black candidate seems so sure. 
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 people were asked: what mistakes, Bush has committed during his time in office? 89 % have replied: the war in Iraq. 
America is changing. 
The nation lost 50000 troops in Vietnam and was a kick in the pants sent back. 
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to. 
Still, Iraq remains for the majority of weak point of Bush. 
The person who will take his place, faces a huge task. 
United States. The financial collapse leaves scar journalists: in the newspapers, you can already feel cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "murderers" of the printing press. 
Five hundred American journalists have been consulted by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control the future. 
Today, almost all journalists pessimistic about their future. 
But they said the information on staff not really concerned about the general's credibility. 
They do not feel so alone, as in the past. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 is a crisis for these journalists an economic model, which has been destroyed. 
Added to the big problems caused by the cuts taken News room, so the area in which the editors work the newspaper. 
It is a problem that needs to be resolved – the interviewten journalists – if you want to avoid that, the traditional journalism, such as the big audience understands it not significantly shrinking. 
A clear, but more complicated pessimism met today, the American journalist. 
Six out of ten journalists and Executive Seniors pressure press are of the opinion that the journalism at national level on the wrong track. 
In the local area, there are even in the Executives of the 65 %. 
Print vs. Broadcast. 
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the web. 
The most important publishing groups find the way to the Internet, which is regarded by many as the "killer" of the printing press. 
The "economic pressure" by the journalists, has increased by up to 79 %. 
The 500 interviewten journalists have admitted that the new technology to want to join in the hope of "expressing something good for the journalism." 
The biggest rift in American journalism today between the head of the News editors Room and the reporters who work for them. 
56 % of the editors at national level are sure their reporters share their values with them, while at the local level are only 23 %. 
Some think, it has to do with the "security in the work." 
The business managers, the fear of losing their jobs within three years, 47 % at national level. 
The journalists are 30 %. 
The issue of the "safe work" in the team (our "editors," Anm.d. Red.) is a hot topic in the United States. 
Only 13 % of the journalists are under contract. 
In a vast nation, as the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, and TV-Sendern and Internet operators offer employers as they want, and so it is a question of take it or leave it. 
The editors get very often very high wages, the editor, however, can sometimes only 10000 euros per month, pension and insurance funds. 
As for the holiday, so will the complicated thing: a certain amount of days in the first year, and so many after the third, after a certain number of years to achieve 15 vacation days. 
But the American journalists are as they admit themselves, often in the course of the year "sick". 
It is a matter of climate. 
UNIPOL: GERICHT IM ROME: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA 
The president of the second criminal division of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate Maklers. This had asked of Grottaferrata to be transferred to Rome. 
It will Bankrot against Coppola because within the framework of the inquiry into the deal in the case of the adoption of Unipol-Bnl. identified. 
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, was transformed his release from house arrest in a residence in Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had requested to allow the real estate broker, from the provincial town in a home in the capital, to be moved. 
According to the court, he could give such transfer (against which the public prosecutor's office had) the ability to influence its society and to him anklagendes evidence. 
The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had already revealed a few days ago, when the Chamber of Deputies against the 700 Milliarden-Dollar-Sparpaket of the White House agreed: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the economy. 
This confirms the yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reported, as the crisis over the Republican party step divide, the increasingly divides in their old and moderate East Coast soul, always the state institutions, and the business community favoured and those neo-conservative "in Washington," and the world of finance is hostile, particularly in the south and centre of the states electorate wins. 
This part of the party owes his rise, particularly the voice of the I mentioned above. 
This is just mentioned example, however, only a small part of the big changes, which is the current economic earthquake announces or even already: not only in the United States, even across the West and perhaps even beyond that will be affected by these. 
In both states, as well as in Europe seems to speed up the crisis the long feared events, which in these new conditions finally start to take shape and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the Neuentdeckung, the unseemly renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
In fact, the crisis is a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to the abroad and manage an enormous amount of assets of individual households living in a single state. 
This means an immediate political problem for the government: how to behave with the families involved, which is also a huge mass of voters. 
The crisis seems so economically globally, politically it is almost purely at national level. 
The political internationalism seems itself to be sidelined, and the right to have lost: the obvious evidence of this is given by the EU which, because of their bipolar in different national and international conflicts, a common way to know. 
So now all with the intervention of their own state ; rescue plans, the new rules, and particularly distribution of aid fund: since the crisis has always been serious to save are only the United States in the economic situation without foreign aid. 
And in addition to the funds they have also to use the legitimacy of this: not, therefore, two überwertende conditions –, under certain circumstances, – what otherwise no international organization, and not a market in a similar way. 
The new emphasis on state national element is in line with the ever larger significance recently in the economy with a closely related sector associated: the territoriality. 
Paradoxically, it is now, as we were so convinced long in a networked total happened to be in a range of always different technologies, Immateriellen, that we need to see how our future, but more and more will depend on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil. 
These can be transported while to be sure, all from one place to the other in the world, but are yet to extreme with a closely associated umschriebenen piece of earth – a territory. 
That is why the person who has such a territory, another, lives in a ernteertraglosen, wasserlosen or oil free area in the advantage. 
I now turn to the second novelty, but a brief digression. 
Who territory, who government who says policy, saying leadership. 
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand there is the recognition of the need for Distinguished Leader ships, so the need for someone who knows how things. 
On the other hand, is now a wave of indignation about the existing leaders, particularly those of the economy, which have insufficient and full of shadow zones. 
Moreover, after all, a deeper further and, in one sense, is even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, a impatience, a picture of the futility, a sense of distant, all to a whole class of managers of Western countries. 
It seems that the belief among large sections of the population to pave the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their ideas world, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is the majority than foreign and outdated. 
The demand for leadership so underground feeds a linked but powerful movement the removal of the political class and the traditional political establishment, which translates into unplanned "revolts" of the voters, and in the collective mind sudden swing state for the last time: starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, the rebellion of American legislators against Bush (and perhaps also plays the victory of the right here in Italy, a role). 
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectuals, creditors, some would say to her stature ever more understanding problems, and therefore less representative value on what is nowadays in the lower social classes of the West is going on, and the financial crisis, and to the Überdimensionalität. 
With all that in mind, it would be an exaggeration simply to speak of a "rebellion of the masses." 
But eyes wide open to keep, however, it is not safe. 
The Superkleber, high walls can get 
The forces of gravity, thanks to a Klebstoffes to beat high and walls to climb as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which is now seems almost reached that goal. 
With a in an area of only 2.5 qcm disgruntled Kleber managed researchers focused 100 kg of serious assaults on a senkrechten wall. 
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material invented by the team of researchers is a further development of already used Klebstoffe, which use a special carbon structure, called Kohlenstoff-Nanoröhrchen. 
"The principle of Klebers, one can imagine how a series to a pile of spaghetti angeordneter tubes," said Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists from the feet of the Geckos inspired by mikroskopischen Härchen are covered, the animal to be a perfect. 
The various materials such as glass Teflon and Schleifpapier conducted tests have shown that the new Kleber is ten times more than the stops ability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time, "easily move away from the wall", so Liming Dai, researchers in the department of engineering at the University of Dayton. 
Nazionale MAUERN ENTLANG WANDERN? "this material could be used as a deciduous glue," Liming Dai sets. 
For example, as Spiderman in soared walls? Perhaps, but the researchers rather think about a less fascinating benefits, such as the combination of electrical equipment, for the Nano tube culture are as head of heat and electricity. 
Other areas of application could fall within the scope of space. 
For the moment, the super heroes must wait. 
The one ANDERE ART DER FORSCHUNG also – the University of Berkeley, California, a new Kleberart addresses. 
In an article of the American Chemical Society present the Californian scientists a glue from the micro fibers like hair by movement on a clean surface even the dust and always maintain a perfect liability. 
Medicines: never play with fruit juice 
Beware of Grapefruit, orange, and apple juice. 
These drinks which, because of their refreshing quality and their vitamin wealth, particularly in the summer are consumed, can cause severe damage to their health, if they are the same with certain vital drugs, since they might have an impact on the inclusion of these through the body in extreme way. 
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly highlights the risk comes pre-packed as fresh fruit juices in connection with medications. Within the framework of the 236. Meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he proposed the alarm again: suffice it a glass of apple, orange or Grapefruitsaft to reduce the capacity of certain vital drugs, that virtually eliminated, and the health of patients at risk. 
Grapefruitsaft was already under suspicion, to be responsible for the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, Antiasthmatika, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytischer and neurological resources to increase toxic levels. 
MEDIKAMENTE IN GEFAHR – Dieselbe Agency medicine had warned in a report two years ago, doctors and patients about the dangers of this Mixes, and stressed to take note of what, in conjunction with resources such as Diazepan drunk or Metadon. 
Rural IS NOT NUR GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice, substances which can inhibit medicines. 
The list of substances gehemmten from fruit juice is a long one. 
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale di Milan and treasury securities climbed: " these results are usually immediately passed on to the various international manufacturers, which is free to change consumer information. 
It is therefore always package leaflets to read, and, if still have to be clarified to are not afraid of a pharmacist or doctor to ask, " the expert stressed the Ansa agency. 
Economic Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman 
The economic Nobel Prize is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity. 
Of the 55 years old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer, who teaches at the University of Princeton and known for his regular article for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the economic and foreign policies of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, while the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman in an editorial in the New York Times claims that this second event was crucial for the history of the United States as the attacks. 
A predictive not received little controversy in response and the economists still years later was accused today but as turns out to be entirely correct. 
"I am surprised and shocked by how quickly the memory of the scandals within the framework of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom, disappeared from the public to the fore," Krugman declared the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi by the executive committee of the European Central Bank Krugman is a "economist of great value," but also a Banalisierer with a "very aggressive style, especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government." 
Open Office, it seems the third version of the "Microsoft" package 
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 0 is ; the open-source software wins than cost free substitute for Microsoft's Office an ever greater number of users, both at home and in the office, both in free artists and the public administration. 
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which will be supervised by SUN Micro system, presented the new Open Office now with some new features to the audience: in addition to a revised and now spartanischer were initial menu is finally a fundamentally ensured compatible with Apple's operating system, Mac OS X, and the support for the new ODF (Open Document format) 1 point 2 format, so the latest Standard-ISO version. 
Eight against was also on the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx,.xlsx,.pptx) read Open Office. 
Interesting are also some new features, such as those which makes it possible to reduce the size of Power Point presentations to preserve what, for example, the ability to send via email. This is also the possibility of PDF files in Grafikbearbeitungsmodule to import and at the same time the original appearance of the side. 
So can now generate "hybrid" PDF-Dateien extend the typical chart of the Adobe-Formats the elements of a table and a text processing system. 
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications, tables can be dealt with now mehrhändig by various users, which conflicts are avoided change ; in the case of the text processing system will assign each own officials a Frabe in order to guarantee a better correction procedure. 
Some companies are in the process of various functions of Open Office to be published on the internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks, the final result to be publicized. 
The Italian version is at the following link to download available: http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 reliable / download300.html. Somit follows the English version since Friday in the mirrors. 
Ausser for Windows and Mac OS is the program for the Linux operating system available. 
To question the Installations-CD send home or office. 
However, can keep the cost of freedom of an incentive for the spread of the program in the households, it is also in the area of the business, where Open Office could succeed in the big picture: after all, are already various facilities of public administration and schools moved to Open Office. 
In fact, there is not even on a training range, which means an optimum aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opened business prospects. 
Open Office is composed of five main parts: Writer the Word Texterstellungsprogram ; Calc, the tables Program, which is aimed at a displacement of Excel ; Impress, on the production of presentations with power point ; Dbase for data banks to replace the better-known Access ; and least Draw a chart module. 
The target for the year 2008 it is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that already reached 3 million and 600 thousand can also be easily exceeded. 
Kohl also tested positive and so that the fourth doping case 
It opens a new doping case mi the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athletes Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, as Drittklassifizierter and winner of the T-shirts, the best Kletterers. 
The news, the newspaper L ' team on its Web site. 
The 26-jährige Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver positively to Cera, erythropoietin third generation, has been tested and it was already in the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher. 
The analysis from the Kohls blood samples are among those who in the last few weeks of the Losanna laboratories and Chatenay-Malabry have been made. 
Confirm the samples the positive results in Cera, the Austrians will lose its third place, and for two years to be excluded from the race. 
The head of the French Antidopingkommission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest and enroll right, according to the Associated Press the Austrian. 
The 26-jährige Austrians rose behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the Americans Cadel Evans on the podium, and took up also the jersey of the best Kletterers. 
THEMA EINWANDERUNG: the one FRAGT NEW YORK TIMES: ITALIEN IST RASSISTISCH? 
Italy, " the former land of immigrants has become recently one of the favored countries for immigrants ', which only with reluctance. 
Into this Belpaese a nation of racists? Asks the New York Times in a long article, which is the subject of racism in Italy, and the case of the young, from Burkina Faso ethnic Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan, after he had a packet of biscuits. 
The case bears witness to what the Times as "a paradox of the North called": the northern regions are those in which is "the most integration and job opportunities", but "the highest degree of anti immigrationism Sentiments and the largest of the support of the Northern League to." 
As confirmation of the growing tension between the Italians and the immigrants, the Times cites more episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only that. 
The new, by the League sponsored legislation against immigration and to accelerate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is a sign of climate change in Italy. 
A movement, which also underscore the Pope and the president, "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal cooperation between church and state to combat racism." 
Students victims of up to 900-Euro per room, high prices Miets 
The market for homes for students knows no crises. 
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the tenants union can cost a single room a students up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome. 
" This phenomenon has already approved very serious trains. All large numbers of students so in fact lose their right to study, because their families are not in a position to support them at that level, " – the person in charge of the Sunia, Laura Mariani – " in these cities leads the major demand by the students to a adulteration of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants. 
Moreover, the most rental offers a series of offences: free contracts, lack of registrations, without rental price border, illicit Untermieten. 
For the Sunia, there is the need for extraordinary measures by a revision of the taxing lead to lower rental prices. 
On closer scrutiny of the investigation it turns out that sleep place in Milan, a quarter of approximately 450 euro Brianza will be needed ; a single room starts with 650 euros (in the quarter Nere ties) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter Lambiate, Udine and Fiera, or even 900 euros in the quarter Vittoria. 
In Florence, costs an average of a sleeping place 350 / 400 Euro, a room 700. 
In Bologna, where the students are in the quarters at the university focus 250 / 280 euros for a sleeping place needed, 370 to 500 for a single room. 
In Rome, the prices in the areas around the Uni at about 600 euros for a single room for 450 sleeping place in a double room. 
Little rents are deeper into the quarters for the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà. 
Only those who switches in foreign districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleep and 450 euro for a single room in Prenestina, Cento Celle and similar quarters. 
In Naples scrap heap 300-450 one euro for a sleep, for a room is the price of between 400 and 600 Euro in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli tabled Aminei. 
In Bari costs a sleeping place 250-350 Euro, a single room at least 350. 
In the smallest towns are lower prices, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy. 
In the cities in which the phenomenon of sub-chartered in non-European students is more often, as in Perugia, even exists another anomaly: a rent, which 25-30 % above the average of foreign students. 
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – cities are their historic cinemas 
The historic cinema close because of the beneficiary Multiplexkinos. 
"A city with no cinemas is a blind city, as a face with no eyes." 
This image of the film director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect as now in the large urban centres of Italy, and in the provinces, is happening. 
The process of exclusion of cinema that began with the birth of the great Multisaalkomplexe in the periphery, in the long run, the death of the Einsaalkino in center. A process, not only seems inevitable and irreversibly, but also the traits of a cultural crime. 
Affected mostly historical sites full of memories, "it is like to lose a friend with a piece of streets full of emotion has come," the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" him 20 years ago the Oskar and the big prize at Cannes, and it is the story of a suburban theatres and nostalgia, which it is to live in a well for ever lost cinema world. 
The figures, which have Anec, the key industry association provides a clear language: in the last five years the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinema must close ; this bill paid for the most part, the cinema in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, in Turin, 6 and 5 in Palermo. 
The worst affected areas include the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This indicates that the main culprits are the Multiplexkinos, for it is precisely these three regions in which registered the largest number of these modern cinema: there with 195 in the last five years the Lombardy lists, 81, both in Tuscany in Emilia-Romagna. 
" The business has evolved in an irrational manner, " Paolo Protti, the President of the Anec, " it is useful that new structures, but it is first and foremost the preservation of the already exist, because includes a room in the city are not all of his regular customers willing to pay, rather than the old one Multiplexkino in the periphery. 
And here is the lack of budget for the Fund's äußer industry associations: the recorded by the state debt burden is around 10 million euros. 
It is a disgrace from an ethical and moral position that the government ignored the existing laws. 
In order to obtain the sector would be between 16 and 18 million euros in the year needed. " 
It is interesting to the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, because of fears that the old cinemas has decided to protect these through an agreement between the community and the Anec ; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support the traditional movie theatres, and both in the historic center and in the periphery. 
Among the imminence of the measures are also granting tax divisions for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the audience on the transportation: it will be allowed to drive in traffic from limited areas of the centre, and also to more favorable to park parking fees. 
" It is a good initiative, " Giuseppe Tornatore, " I hope that other cities will follow our example and, moreover, still new design concepts. 
To be sure, but we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to focus on the superpower of the Multiplexsäle, because, after all, the audience is more ambitious. 
The defense of the traditional cinema is for me has always been an important issue: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the tipping point me to create the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso," even if I have 10 years since had played with the idea. 
For 25 years, I live in Rome ; if I am on the Rialto or at the Quirinale, in the Via Nazionale, where I have lived through many different emotions, I try to the side so as not to see the dust covered posters. 
The links between politics and the ' Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
" The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to adjust the decisions of the community to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli. 
The accusations the bar of the Antimafia-Behörde Kalabriens against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy, Rosario Schiavone the municipality Gioia Tauro this morning because of involvement have been arrested in Mafia business, are very serious. 
In handcuffs, was also taken Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder mediator between the clan and the public administration, and nephew, the lawyer, which was the same names like the boss of the clans, have already been convicted of involvement in criminal organisations of the mafia, then to a compensation figure of 10 million euros. 
"Any kind of moral and legal standard violation," write the lawyers, "decided the two local authorities, the lawyer Piromalli money to pay for consulting activities." 
"So it was possible the mafia group has been made to – so the judges – formal way into town halls to penetrate and the politics of public administration." 
The head of the regional Kalabriens Committee Agazio Loiero said no, not that it is in its region " far from being an exception on links between local authorities and organized crime. " " there are places in which the concentration of mafia is greater than in others, in which such links are virtually inevitable. 
But there are also local politicians, the pressure of the ' Ndrangheta resist: heroes who received a white snow. " 
The arrests of this morning, followed by those from last July, according to the police forces of the clan Piromalli was beheaded. 
Since the end of the last April was the municipal council of Gioia Tauro dissolved, but back in 1991, – and then, for alleged links between organised crime and the local administration – the local politicians have been stripped of her local offices. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, has been chosen after the runoff from May 2006 to the head of the centre-right coalition. 
He shrieked scandal as the police ordered the dissolution of the municipal council. 
He belangte in the Deputy Minister of Marco Minniti, he had been charged with everything from politically strategic reasons. The judges but explain in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Piromalli-Clan even dared to ask for an amendment to the A3-Projektes. 
From a bugging in connection with the case studies on the Dal Torrione, has shown a willingness to the wishes of a businessman who is known, a representative of the large group of the Piromalli – which measures of public administration identical with the interests of this clans. " 
If the energy from the barrel of waves, suddenly the Great on 
It is a versiegende money source, which seem more than 70 % of the surface of the planet and it is only now that the big energy companies to understand the world. 
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources to which all now look forward, and also to occupy, as giants like Chevron. 
The possibility of winning energy from the movements of the sea, is already 70 years since taken into account and studied ; no coincidence that these studies stronger since the first oil crisis significantly. 
As the price of oil around 1980 vergas caved in to the idea of marine energy, but now push the environmental organisations and the increase in the price of oil to new momentum in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London, estimates that 15 % of the world's energy needs of the energy produced by the ocean waves could be covered. 
This would be the much honey now produced by nuclear power stations energy. 
Added the currents and sea. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first firm, which is now on the marine energy, Enersis, in 2005, a treaty for the construction of a power station in the north of Portugal has signed. 
When the news was published there seemed to be a revolutionary step. 
Two years later, there are now more and more companies in the traditional energy industry, which for the marine energy. 
" Chevron examined these technologies " – as the spokesman of one of the corporate known American giants in the Wall Street Journal – and will be the opportunity to work with us ". 
This is the creation of a licence from the US Energy Commission, which is needed to launch a project off the coast of Alaska. 
This is not to be underestimated as a sign of, particularly when you consider that continue in Alaska oil is encouraged by the United States and President Bush, more recently, the plans for new drilling in motion. 
In addition to Chevron are also the firms Verdant Power, Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey who invest in the new industry ; so, too, are not aware of the details, but observers from a rising interest. 
Still room for improvement in technologies. 
Experts speak of a still in the throes of departure technology, not least because not yet have the last doubts on the part of the environmentalists are resolved. 
So far, are projects such as the one in Portugal and Scotland rather small dimension and seem to be no serious environmental problems. 
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, it requires technologies with far greater impact on the environment. 
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, is using a system of related Bojen. 
The burst of the waves, which Bojen and moved, within the swimmer on Kolben and Zylinder transformed into hydraulischen pressure. 
This drives a Turbine, which in turn is pursuing a generator. 
The electricity is about Unterwasserleitungen sent to the coast. 
Until now, there are four planned facility of this kind, which only waiting for government approval. A part of the energy generated could also be used for military facilities. 
Verdant Power, however, already manufactures energy for a goods department and a Parklatz with the help unterseeischer turbines in the East River in New York. 
The water movements during the tides drives the turbines at what the central movement, leading to the generator. 
According to Verdant has been waiting a long queue of potential clients on the necessary Autorisierungen to make use of this energy sources. 
The waves, tides. 
Deserves a particular interest for now, according to the Institute for electricity generation research the potential, which is in the sea. 
Although it is an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, of solar radiation and the waves and, therefore, a more reliable source of power. 
It is precisely the tidal energy is what federal states such as New York, Maine, Alaska and other coastal states, already 7.5 millions of dollars to invest in 2008 – for 2009 are already planned up to 35 million.
