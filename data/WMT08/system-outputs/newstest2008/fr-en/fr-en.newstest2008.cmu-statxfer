The inflation, in Europe, has wrong on the food
The inflation accelerated, measured in the euro zone, is caused mainly has the rapid increase of prices of food.
In November, the increase of prices, in the 13 countries of the euro zone, was more important by the report to the forecasts, apres a rate of inflation of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was registered, said the office of statistics of the Community Union located has Luxembourg.
The official forecast does not have indicated that 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
Unlike the banks central American, British and Canadian, the the European Central Bank, the ECB -- did not reduced the rate of intéret director in saying that the reduction of intérets, with the growth of the price of matieres premieres and the reduction of the rate of unemployment, lead has the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would maintain the rate of inflation below but close of two percent.
In an analyst, it is the catch 22 for the ECB, " it must deter " the inflation to of not more have has speak on this subject later.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3 percent is a record in these 12 dernieres the years and in Spain, it is went of 3.6 has 4.1.
The inflation in the euro zone has left has cause of the rapid increase of the prices of food and of energy.
The thresholds of the market has the end of cereals have increased from 88 percent and the prices of soya came also its value the highest since 1973.
The price of oil food and of products milk has also greatly increased in 2007.
This year, the international price of oil has increased by 52 percent and, the last month, a barrel of gold black coutait almost 100 dollars.
In the ECB, in 2008, the rate of inflation will of 2.1, this year, has 2.5 percent but, in 2009, it will have 1.9.

In briefly time, they are waiting has it that the ECB reduced the rate director twice in 2008.
Gallup is a crisis of the government
Apres a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz, the Alliance of young Democrats -- has increased significantly early December. As since 2002, it has now the largest number of supporters, then that Gallup, Institute of poll -- there has never seen before a also low support Socialist, has know 13 percent.
For the voters fideles, the difference would, by reason of the greater determination of the people of the opposition, a greater support of two thirds, 71 percent -- against the support of a cinquieme, 20 to 100 -- for the MSZP, the Hungarian Socialist Party --.
In the poll, the MDF, Forum of the Hungarian Democrats -- and the SZDSZ, Alliance of the free Democrats -- are below the threshold of Members, their support is of two percent in the whole population.
On the voters fideles some to go vote, the number of supporters of two parties has increased from 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued of damaged by the report to the previous point the lower, the proportion of those who have thought that the economic situation of the country was particulierement serious there has never been so high, it is growing has 41 percent and in 46 percent more the situation is very serious.
Apres the prospects more optimistic of the spring and of the been last, the families are of new more pessimistic about has their situation financiere.
For the next year, the majority of the population is greater and only a dixieme provides an improvement of the situation.
In December last, 71 percent of people sondées, has said a majority never mind at the previous polls in Gallup, have found that the Prime Minister was his work rather not that well.
13 to 100 of asked have the confidence and much of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány then that 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not are not of any confidence in Prime Minister and 27 percent in the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change of the political situation is the proportion of the society think that the dissatisfaction vis-a-vis of Prime Minister can etre Treaty without the change of government.
So that apres the riots of last October, 35 percent of interviewed wanted that the government and the Prime Minister remains in office, now this rate is not that 20 percent. The majority on, 33 percent -- believes that the holding of new elections would the solution has this situation.
In the issue on the intention of the vote, 60 percent of interviewed are that they would certainly vote and the 20 percent supplementary say they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a " the legislative election held next Sunday ", only 55 percent of interviewed participate certainly and 15 percent additional participate probably. Under the current intentions, the result of the referendum would not no doubt.
74 percent of the people would not the rights of registration in the higher education, 79 percent would not the cost of consultation and 84 percent would not the cost of residence has the hospital.
When we look only the memes proportion of the people who have expressed their intention of voting in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters reject the introduction of the rights of inclusion, of the costs of consultation and of the costs of residence has the hospital.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its price of pres of 20 percent
The hypermarchés countries in the triangle trade of Budaörs have maintained the average of the prices of 16 percent of the year derniere has the difference that this year the rate of VAT did not increased.
The Article of Napi Gazdaság, daily economics --
This year, in the triangle trade of Budaörs, the Panier of Christmas day usual has increased also of 16 percent in the average, an increase of value much higher has 000 forints is account in all the hypermarchés.
The price, «qui is were déja envolés» in the large stores of food in last December, does not have more increased brutally by the report has the high basis previous.
However, the consumers are clearly shocked of the fact that the items purchased far below nine 000 forints the year derniere coutent now more of 10 000 forints.
The Panier daily in the hypermarchés asked has exceeded of 91 forints, to the minimum, the psychological threshold of 10 000 forints.
And the value the highest of the basket is was has 10 573 forints.
, In 2003, the value was of 6 800 forints. --
The price of the Unicum and of fish living were almost to the level of the year derniere, however the price of the net of turkey, of the nuts and of poppies have greatly increased.
In the shops, the price of the meal and bread has followed the data of KSH, Institute Central of Statistics -- but, in Auchan, it was the work of a kilo has 139 forints only.
The competition did not reduced the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising of see, also in the hypermarket, that the price of the bottle record of two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, it not coutait therefore that 257 forints the bottle noted are seen.
It not empeche that this year, in the end of Panier newspaper, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheaper.
On apres our calculations, Cora has increased the price of its Panier newspaper of 15 percent then that Tesco and Auchan the have increased respectively of about 18 and 18 percent.
In comparing the basket the most expensive of the year derniere and the basket the cheaper of this year, we have a gap of 12 percent then that the difference between the cheapest of the year derniere and the more expensive of this year is of 21 percent.
The prices have risen of 1 480 forints in the average.
The year derniere, the prices have increased of 1 206 forints in average, while in fact that the impact of the increase of the rates of VAT is déja said in the price of Christmas of the last year.
This process has been confused the trade, the hypermarchés not could not see clearly apply the margin on products as they were unable of be the impact of the change of prices on the consumption.
, If a retailer work hard the rotation of a product, it the risk of losing a big profit on the margin adapted has the intensity of trade. --
The cause of the change of rate of VAT, the increase of prices of Panier newspaper has moved of maniere so excessive that the basket the more expensive was higher of 1 720 forints has the value of that of 2006 then that the difference between the baskets the cheaper does not was that 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the basket the more expensive was higher of 1 630 forints has one of the year derniere and the price of cheaper have increased of 1 284 forints also.
In bringing the season of Christmas, we have seen a catastrophic increase of prices, in less of 20 months the price of articles of the daily consumption rose of more of 30 percent in the hypermarchés.
, This does not confirm not only the data of KSH: for some alimentations of premiere need, the institute of statistics has seen an increase of the price of most of 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case for example of the meal and of the egg. --
In the Panier day of this year, it is almost absurd because the level of price of the product, déja very expensive the year derniere, has increased to has death more of 10 percent by the report has the basis.
In the evidence, the suppliers of meal have a position stronger that the suppliers of eggs as they have managed has to accept the sharp increase of prices also by the multinationals.
In the triangle of the gold trade, the hypermarchés not complain not, they are constantly of good years.
On apres our experience, the majority of customers do not look more the prices in the three hypermarchés visited.
They achetent all in quantity, they are the food of the long conservation by pellets.
Wednesday morning of queues important they are trained to the coffers of three hypermarchés because the number of customers has increased suddenly.
However, in our information, the number of cases is less important in the province, of many multinationals complain aupres of companies of the poll of not briefly not achieve the figure of Affairs provided, not just for the food but also for the articles of the sustainable consumption.
Many hospitals are the economy on the disinfection
This year, most of 000 infections, caused mainly by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of the medical staff does not help not has block the infections, said the doctor in charge of the national center for epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also the economy on the disinfection
It not is not long a infection MRSA has been diagnosed to the service of traumatologie of the hospital János.
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics has been detected on a man hospital result has a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year a infection similar happened to briefly place.
The injuries of a serious accident of the car has of the hospital but little of time apres it has of return this through to a infection MRSA and, since, the doctors did not have it be a major operation has cause of the bacteria which is in the body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1 094 infections hospitalieres generated by a agent pathogene multirésistant have been declared to the Systeme national of monitoring nosocomiale, said Karolina Böröcz, the doctor in the head of the national center of the epidemiology.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by an agent pathogene multirésistant who has actually been made in hospitals and for the rest we does not have any information.
About two thirds of infections, 683 infections -- have been caused by the MRSA, that said by the staphylococcus aureus resistance has the méthicilline-oxacilline.
A third of people are carriers of the bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus, company -- in their noses without it is a disease.
The infection caused by the company, such that angines, amygdalites, infections skin, traumatic injuries -- responding well to antibiotics, they are easily cured.
However, if the antibiotics are used of maniere excessive or inappropriate, the bacterium, which responds well to antibiotics, will a bacterium well resistant to antibiotics which proliférera quickly in the poor conditions hospitalieres.
In the event of bad operation temporary or long of systeme immune, the bacterium can cause of the infections hospitalieres serious, such that a traumatic infection or a septicémie, on the elderly patients, of small weight or with a body weakened.
In the head doctor of the hospital János, it there is nothing of particular in the infections MRSA, these infections are parts of the day of hospitals.
It is not particularly not confuse the infection with the epidemic, it does not of MRSA only the or we not the is not, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The company resistance to antibiotics.
" These patients are isolated, the medical staff is of days in rubber and of the veil of protection and we have of antibiotics used to treat them ", said Tibor Nyulasi.
In theory, the patients admitted are considered if they are carriers of MRSA, however the infection can not not always etre avoided.
The prélevement of the sample was not has the way
The vast majority of infections caused by the MRSA could etre prevented but the conditions and the current circumstances are not right, in the Hungarian hospitals, to prevent the development and the proliferation of agents pathogenes versions, says Karolina Böröcz.
As the infection has especially in the hospitals and in the homes for the elderly people, the hospitals should control the patients admitted and isolate immediately the sick people of MRSA.
However the prélevement microbiologique does not has the way in the Hungarian hospitals.
It must know that the national body of the social security funds not not these tests.
The majority of cases is not the day that if the infection MRSA is detected on the disease, said the doctor in charge of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has of the strict recommendations on has the appropriate use of antibiotics in the human medicine and it is of directives Hungarian also for the recovery of some infections and syndromes.
It must be of efforts to that the antibiotic therapy be targeted, that said of tests microbiologiques should etre made to of empecher the resistance to the drugs but the hospitals did in are not always account.
The implementation of prélevements microbiologiques is even more rare in the care ambulatoires and in the care of the basis, reported Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals are the economy on the disinfection
The scientific evidence shows that the MRSA proliferent of a patient has a other the more often by the middle of the medical staff.
It is therefore important of washing the hands, of put of days and of veil of protection. However of the important shortcomings are detected in the hospitals also in this area.
The MRSA proliferent by infection passed by the inhalation of someone and by contact. However, in view of the conditions in the Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient not not always etre isolated.
In more, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too pres the some of the others then that in the end of the outbreak, the patients should etre from the some of the others of 1.5 metres during.
Unfortunately, we are also that the hospitals, in the situation financiere difficult, are of economies on the disinfectants, they lack of infirmieres, the patients are many, and the risk of contamination is even more important, said Karolina Böröcz.
In Karolina Böröcz, in the hospitals and the preventive measures are met, the number of infections is less of maniere demonstrable or when the proliferation of the agent pathogene can etre blocked.
Draft government against the MRSA
The treatment of the infection MRSA is of the exorbitant expenditure for the coffers of the social security, it is why we fight over against infection.
Britain, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
In the data published, this program is effective and the infections MRSA show a trend valid in England.
The Centre of prevention and of the control of the disease, the ECDC -- fact be among its priorities the prevention of the impact of agents pathogenes versions, as the MRSA also -- and that the prevention of infection hospitalieres caused by these agents pathogenes.

Political Capital, the Guard Hungary has increased the risk countries
In the Division analysis of the risk of Political Capital, Risk-Audit Analysing Division )- the activity of the Guard Hungary, formed in aout last, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom, the Movement for a better Hungary -- increasing, in some aspects, the political risk of Hungary and of the region.
In its ' warning of the risk ', the company says that, in the report with the activity of the Hungarian customs, the greater the risk policy is déja that ' has short term of the ethnic clashes aggressive can happen after has the deterioration of the ethnic tension déja existing between the people gypsy and not gypsy of Hungary '.
The institute of research has added that the policy strategy of the Guard Hungary aimed probably has caused this situation in is the main reason.
As they say, it is by one of the main shortcomings of the political actors Hungarian: ' those public took the public debate on has the case of Roma to the representatives of the political groups radical and extremes who have based a strategy policy on the dispute between the gypsies and the Hungarians '.
The probleme is in is worsened, the normal dialogue is impossible, the extremists are strengthened and the arrival of the aggressive conflict is more likely, say they.
However, that the research institute, under the effect of the greater attention of the media Hungarian and international the business of the Guard Hungary ' has deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary has the foreign, in particular for the confidence in the stability and the democratic maturity of countries '.
They recall that, after has a greater publicity given has the reorganisation of the radical groups and extremes Hungarian Right since the autumn of 2006, of the many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 is giving the name of ' national Association of self-defence '.
' The common feature of the assembly is that they be defined as a civil organization when they say publicly the preparation of their accession has of the tasks of defense, disasters, national defense, defense of the order )- armed if we must, of addition, in about the inability of the police, of the army, that said of the state ', have they added.
They have said that all is going after the method which, in based on the rancoeur of the society of the policy and of the parties, seeking has dress different ambitions policies in a civil aspect.
The emphasis placed on the caractere civil and the status of Association is not therefore only that has prevent the pieges legal of the registration of associations to the court but they also are a policy strategy.
The analysis indicated that the activity of the Guard Hungary is a factor which is also the risk by report to the relations of neighborhood.
' These few months, from many countries neighbors cite the Guard Hungary as a source of the potential risk and the players political ultranationalistes of some countries bordering want justify their policy anti-hongroise in referring has the constitution of the Guard Hungary.
This influence the political stability of the region ', have they added.
In the research institute, the constitution of the Guard Hungary does not is not a phénomene single in the Central Europe of the East, the political risks have increased on the whole of the region.
As they say, the operation of the Guard Hungary is, for example, has the activity of the Guard national Bulgarian that the constitution has been declared by the European Union national Bulgaria, BNU -- in aout 2007.
The many problems of the Roma that have occurred in a neighborhood of Sofia, Kraszna Poljana -- are has the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian custody.
In view of these events, the BNU decided of be a warning by saying that the objective of the organization is ' the national self-defence '.
In them, these 17 dernieres years, the gypsies have ' terrorizing ' the Bulgaria but the state is remained inactive and neutral, reminded the Political Capital.
They have added that the initiative has been of considerable debate in the public opinion Bulgarian.
As they say, the statement of some organizations of the Bulgaria Roma on the constitution of their own care in the way of resistance would the increase the risk of the ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Guard Hungary showing of similarities with that of the national customs Bulgaria does not excluded not that the Roma Hungary react has the threat of the briefly maniere in organising their own self-defence, can be read in the warning of the risk of Political Capital.
At the request of information of the brief agency, Attila Juhász, director of research of Political Capital, said: the analysis of risk is the one of the activities of the research institute.
As he has said, their risk analysis is published all the years and if of events occurring which could have an impact on the change of risk, they in inform the public opinion, as in the case now, in issuing a warning of danger.
The fete is not marked in the red everywhere
In Hungary, the law provides exactly the days of fete and, on of fetes, it became aware of reorganising the days working which the number will the next year.
The fetes are not uniform in the EU and the US not more.
The Hungarian law distinguishes the days of fete national and of state and that the days of rest.
The days of rest are often linked has of fetes religious or has of the historical events important.
In Hungary, we fetons the new year, the last day of the year who is close and the first day of the new year are also of days of rest, it of all more for that the réveillonneurs can be easily.
In fact, in a year, we have in all 11 fetes years in the red.
The 15 March is a fete national, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, such as the 23 October also who is the commemorative day of the revolution of the anniversary
The 20 aout, we fetons the constitution of the state, the 1 May is the fete of work and the 1 and 2 November, we we remember of the members of our family and of our friends died.
In addition, we have two days has Easter, has the Whit and has Christmas.
The days of our fetes of state, national or even religious they rarely on a weekend, that the timetable, it became aware of reorganising the working days in the case and it is not that a working day before or apres the fete year in the red.
It is true that we pay the price of weekend extended in working and in which has the school the Saturday before the long weekend.
For many years, the Minister of work rules in a regulation particuliere on the days of the replacement of days before or after the fetes.
The law extends to all employers and for all their employees employees, on the officials and on the people working in the public service.
It does not, for the services companies, the institutions change without disruption and in the service, of by their purpose, and as for the rest days.
This year, the days of work will be amended only on of fetes of the end of the year, has start of 24 December, the life is arrete almost throughout the country because that the experience the majority of people is rather of the additional hours or is of holiday they have saved has these purposes to move the days between Christmas and the day of the new year in them.
The next year much of fetes fall to the environment or has the end of the week, by consistent it is less of changes to the level of days of work by report has this year.
The timetable will be adopted the premiere time around the fete of work for the employees of remain among them four days of affilé.
The Saturday 25 April is a day of work for a day of rest the Friday 2 May.
Another change is expected to the 23 October, the on 18 October will a day of work replacing the Friday 24.
In revenge, the next year, the end of the year if the announcement in the sign of fetes because has start of 24 December, the whole world will a break non-stop briefly if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.

If you want respond to the expectations, you are not better
It is slowly in the boat usual the morning.
It has coup, a tune particuliere is heard has the radio, the voice of a violin has which of the electronic effects are involved.
I was the its.
The music changes of pace and the low is to support the tone of any has the time, then a choir women has this is join as a true bijou.
Mr2 widespread the song Wings of the Love of Zagar.
The musical life Hungarian not we have point spoiled for long with a pop electronic of good quality.
And, now it seems that the boat is different if you monitoring the new album of Zagar.
The outbreak of Yonderboi, the some new production interesting set of the underground digital Hungarian are not has little has changed the image of the whole and, in spite of the new way the garage rock tearing the guitare, the électropop Hungarian shows that it is the new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer is reached of Pécs and it was lui-meme in the group of Yonderboi before that it not they would on its own way, peut-etre because that ' it there not of the place for two feet in a briefly footwear '.
His project, Zagar -- and its music, a included of jazz, of music dansante electronic and of pop, began has be known when the it has given to him the composition of soundtracks filmed, p.m. former.
The season of Ferenc Török --.
The training playing at the beginning in the small clubs began has etre known by a greater public when the magazine wan2 has made their first album of 2002 among the 50 most important records of the Hungarian market and has declared Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost own creators of the trend Hungarian who are also competitive has the west.
Zagar and its whole have become clearly ' trendy ' but nobody not their has asked if they wanted well be the label.
The group has responded as it should, it has been a new and better record.
The album title Cannot Walk addition Instead, out recently, can open of the new ways for them, although the title would be a continuity with the past years has Pécs.
It is that it was a line of the former group of Pécs of Balázs Zságer.
We are well with the reference to the flight but has side of the music air is now, in the spirit and the trend of the times, the guitare stronger, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, singer working currently in England with the group The Puzzle, has shown his talent in the songs in of the premiere of the album to the Park millennium.
On the album, it is a true dispute to the radio, mr2 Petõfi, go for little of the music popular of the morning to the evening, has begun has introduce the songs of Wings of Love record with six chanteuses Hungarian, " Underground Divas " --.
All is well therefore, .. .
Hvg. hu has asked of the issues has Balázs Zságer.
Hvg. hu, This new dispute me lead has ask a question: is it that your music is far been a music for a certain time?
Zságer Balázs: The end of the music for a certain ozone not me said not great thing.
For me it is two castes in the music légere, not the mainstream and underground, not alternative or pop but music trade and music sincere.
The music itself saying alternative, underground can etre also poor and made only to sell them and become and trade.
However, a good song pop can etre sincere also.
The attitude of the reception work in the spirit also regardless of language or of frontieres.
Hvg. hu: Is it that you see a difference between the public Hungarian and foreign, is it that the one or the other is more opened has your music?
Zs. B. : In the country, especially has the west the music légere has of more old traditions.
The, the people go to concerts and not just the young people of a decade or vingtaines of years but also the older.
They are with much more of attention the changes occurred in the music légere because they believe that it is also part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg. hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Es you interest of know who, or and how of the people listening your music?
Zs. B. , I am also pleased to see that the people are of more in more has our concerts.
But we did not fact of music for the market.
For we the music was not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important to the concerts or the mutual influence is déja but it is not seen that in the changes elusive of time.
However, I have noticed that if you wanted respond to the expectations of the public, you will not better.
Hvg. hu: Is it that you accounts follow the example of Yonderboi?
It is only and did carriere rather has the west.
Zs. B. : We do not are not really its way briefly if sometimes some are of find of traces in our music.
We are rather of players in the team who have confidence in the presence music of the other and the should be made.
In the beginning, it was well on inevitable that our music is compared has one of Yonderboi because we are several has leave his group and has taken a different way.
Hvg. hu: On the palmares of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love is the premiere place.
There are those who have heard the name of Zagar for the premiere time by the way of this song.
With the style more popular you have opened want to a ozone broader?
Zs. B. , We did not set of be a dispute for power sell the record.
This song is say most of things.
We the have wanted to the final of the album to try to mitigate the orgy of sides and the themes more difficult addressed in blue.
Hvg. hu: How have you chosen the six chanteuses?
Why they, what was the main line?
Zs. B. : The idea was for a choir of the kind gospel.
We have had the idea of deal this choir of good solistes of the scene music Hungarian.
As was composed the choir has six members, has know Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi (Neo] , Juci Németh, that the has called to we then Underground Divas.
Hvg. hu, You have wanted this song as it to the girls have changed a little?
Zs. B. : This part was déja for long in an instrumental version and then when we have made the album, we have thought that it was still a thing has this song.
The result of agreements has brought the voice of the song.
I have changed the night briefly the tune that the girls have learned more later.
I the have been almost all of result and all was very spontaneous.
I am reminded that me has galvanized has the time but quite sure we have been need of Divas.
With my voice it does not have not been the briefly force.
Hvg. hu, On the record and to the concert also it seemed that the girls were in arriere plan.
It there is not of aria, has the exception of a brief aria of Judy Jay )- it does not have not of the role only, they sing all whole and they do not sing not stronger that the music, therefore the music does not that accompanied their song.
They were derriere on the scene also.
Is it agreed?
Zs. B. : The fact that they were in arriere plan is the only has of problemes technical.
For against, this who was voluntary, it is that we did not want distribute of the roles of solo.
The song said also that we must forget a little our egos, and who has of or, who is or, it should just be that these groups, the wings of love, we need.
I wanted that the others are also same euphoria that we have seen when the song is born.
Hvg. hu, Which of songs you has been the most work?
Zs. B. : In fact say, no on the process of creating music, we have been of pieces more difficult in the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, and I is has a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes free-to-air The Girls, or the groove not was not work for long, and then, little has small, all this is put in place as in a puzzle.
Hvg. hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs. B. : It changes all the time with the concerts and of the fact that I have déja ' yield ' this record.
In this moment, this is Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The birthday.
The tradeur telling has risk of billions to the cause of its complex of disadvantage
A fraudster dissimulateur.
This means its former employee the giant French the company general, the owner of the bank Czech Komerční banka.
The bank has lost to the cause of him nearly five billions of euros.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is that a great player who wanted to match its Members, and who, in more, not can not be regarded as unable.
Unlike all the big houses of the bank, it has agreed to time the crisis of the market of mortgage US.
" It is fragile ", have been heard its higher that the have reported to the police.
However, if the we are in is to the statement of Kerviel reported by the French media, which The World, the transactions of the man had in the end of the year last a benefit amounting to 1.6 billion of euros.
The crisis over the Etats-unis
" All this that I wanted, it was win of the money for my bank ", says -t it in the statement.
The been last, he has managed to take of the crisis American to win a billion of euros.
In fact, it has felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
The information have begun to emerge in February that the mortgages said " sub-prime ", given to customers to low income or even to those who had met in the past of the difficulties of reimbursement, would of problems.
But this crisis can not impact on the whole of the economy.
Kerviel there are believed not and it has staked much.
Thus, in the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion of euros.
" If I had won my first half, I do not know not how the report ", have Kerviel and added that it has not, of course, nothing left to itself. "
Throughout the interrogation, it must be distorted the reports to do not be detected.
It has managed to mislead his bosses, well as the exchange Eurex has begun to be interest in its transactions.
Who do not will not n´a nothing
Craignait it to be found?
Rather not.
" J'estimais that the simple fact of having reached 1.6 billion for the bank was the meet. "
On which has its will of the risk so great?
It is not able to the post that gradually.
It had started to work in the company General in 2000 just after having finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about 51 million dollars.
Two years more late, it was already going of tradeur and, in 2005, it became tradeur independent with an annual salary of 90 million dollars.
However, we knew that it would not never all that the other.
" From my first meeting in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered that the other.
In view of my training university and of my career professional and personal ", said the investigators Kerviel.
However, shortly after his entry in office, it is his first major success.
With the actions Allianz, it has won a billion of euros in building on the reduction of the title in attacks of London.
And the mechanism was launched, it was more.
Until that you gagnes, it leaves you in peace
" It is was like a snowball effect of snow ", has -t he said to the police.
But the higher were the course of all, or rather, they had itself.
" Until that I gagnais, they were the kind of close the eyes. "
However, it is then that comes the time of the beginning of the year.
It is a millions of euros in a day.
In the middle, after the weekend, he decided to hide the money.
Monday, when is to work, it is more employee of the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it has lost 5 billions of euros to cause of him.
And how is it that we the has found?
It became the suspect in question of its leave.
" L'année last, I have not taken that four days of holidays.
A trader who does not of the holiday is a trader who does not allow his book to a other ", concludes Kerviel.
The Czech has the opportunity to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the Ministers of the government Czech have signed in any new programs operational with representatives of the Commission Union, which could, in the years to come, make 14 billions of euros, about 365 billions of kroner Czech -- to the Czech Republic.
It is to more closely of the part of the whole of the amount that the Czech can get of Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.

The Court has confirmed the death of 20 years of prison for the ex-président of Nicaragua
The Court of appeal of Nicaragua confirmed Thursday the death of 20 years of prison for the former President of the country Arnold Alemán, to which it has been sentenced in 2003 for fraud of 100 millions of dollars, up 1.8 billion of the money. .
However, more recently he has been released and was set to residence in his Hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of the state centre-américain, in office between 1997 and 2002, will or not to new encarcéré was for the moment, of after the agency PA, not clear.
In the President of the Court of appeal Ileana Perez, all will depend now of agents of prison, and although they will Aleman end his death in him, or of will of new in prison.
It is 4 years, the Court has shown qu´Alemán was regularly the money of the government to accounts of the foreign companies to Panama.
It is of the fictitious companies and the accounts were in reality to the members of his family and to his supporters the closer.
A part of the money came in the funds qu´Alemán was created to of finance his electoral campaign in 2001.
It has adopted the budget
It is and.
The same budget has been adopted.
In what this budget is it work?
It is the first budget presented by the government and accepted by the majority government without the support of the opposition.
He for the year in the course was a year ago with the support of the Czech Socialist, ČSSD, since it is the Minister Sobotka who the had prepared and ČSSD could not afford his refusal.
Unlike the debate announced before the vote of the statement of no-confidence in the government, this fois-ci, nothing of tragedy.
The House of representatives has passed without any problem this law which, although that the more influential, is to practice neglected.
That a kind of paradox.
What the like it or not, every section and every Article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is the constituent part of the policy, but hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
This last is more attractive media and it is to that that the it gives him more of attention in the media.
The arguments of the men policies are much more l´opinion that the figures rash.
The national Budgets of the governments Socialists moved suffering of three problems that the current budget does not is unlikely to settle at the time:
The first is the importance given to the costs of office imposed by the law, made not only by the pensions, but also by the social costs, adopted the last year by the " coalition " silent with the parties ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is a economy deficit, the result of the first evil.
The third obstacle, it, is formed by the deficit of the public finances, I. e. by the deficit of cities and of common.
However, this is not the lack of budget state that is the most significant hazard.
It is public and not under control.
The real bomb to delay, it is the lack of cities and of common.
Many of the mayors were often, in étourdis, of obligations, endettant problems their municipalities, order to achieve, set to share the money from of taxes, of rights tax and of resources of the bank, of new sources of investment.
In years past, they managed to pay these debts by the sales in volume of actions of systems of distribution, particularly of those of energy, made of the Member State in the framework of privatization.
Aujourd'hui, they do not have more of this souce.
If the it is we just the facts official and verifiable, we see that,
Our economy is already for years, just as the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD not not of this in venter.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of the party of giving the public finances.
However, to the place of this, they endettaient the state of more in more.
Other countries, put to share some exceptions such as Hungary, the Albania or the Egypt, have managed their home of a way much more reasonable that our Republic.
It is a terrible shame that falls primarily on the previous governments.
We are part of the countries which, at the global level, are the most threatened by poverty.
We have not therefore without of programs social areas which is are, just over the past few years, unfortunately unnecessarily enflés.
Of that the we have managed to remove a part of the populist spending absurd, approved the last year before the elections, if a gap of the limit of age for retirement, and that a reform of the system of pensions does not have not taken soon, then any political will to be in the country and whoever is in power, it will not that administration.
In éxagérant to death, we can say that the political men on can become of bureaucrats distributing méchaniquement the majority of the money imposed between the pensions and the social benefits.
This is the reason for which the current budget can not be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism which is that the ordinary costs are rejected by the costs of office.
The deficit of 70 billion planned for 2008 is absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments did not go all the money they could.
If we do not want really not that it is that the policies on can become of simple bureaucrats, it we must be patient and give to the coalition government fragile, aware that the country can not spend that the equivalent of what it is to take in taxes and in rights tax, the necessary calm to the preparation of new laws of reform.
It there is that these last which will to achieve gradually a budget state balanced.

The banks want resolve the crisis
The Bank Federal of reserve US, the the European Central Bank and the central banks English, Swiss and Canadian decided of combat all the crisis of the financial markets.
More of 100 billions of dollars are well placed on the market monetary by the intermédiare of auctions.
It comes to the banks of sell, by a system of auctions, the rate of interest auquels they are ready to use of the money.
By way of example, the Fed US will send to the auction 40 billions of dollars and, of more, it will 24 billion the central banks Union and Switzerland.
It is the first time since the attacks of 11. September that the central banks of the individual countries have decided to action at this point we, for to prevent, and reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
" This approach is to solve the major problems of the economy, to know the more lack of capital free that the banks could be ", written in his report to the customers Bernard Baumohl of the society of Council Economic Outlook Group.
" L'action concerted of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession the Etats-unis of 65 percent to about 50 percent ", adding Baumohl in the report.
The banks have already lost 60 billions of dollars to the cause of loans not repaid, especially the Etats-unis.
The analysts expect more of other losses in billions.
" If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is that they must understand really this who can still be allowed ", said the economist in the head of the ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
" It seems that the situation is really bad ", adding -t it.
The central banks fear that, if the banks themselves have a difficult access to loans, they will be more expensive to their customers.
This reduce the consumption and plunge the American economy in a recession can influence on the economic growth of the whole world.
The central banks have made this choice after that the we did not managed to reduce the inter-bank rates in London, called LIBOR, used to take on the interbank market.
What that means that the banks were still the mutual loans, despite that the banks central American, Canadian and British have been to several times, in the autumn, their rate of interest.
" It has the effect that a new reduction of the rate of interest ", said to the agency Reuters Greg Salvaggio of the Tempus society Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe not that the approach of the central banks will not to avert the crisis, it does not the main problem which is the fall of market property to US.

It is in effect a coined capable of follow and to assess of Treaties scientists, it has the practice of the statistics and it also is the economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, of after him, the following issues: the climate is without stop, the change of it is therefore normal, it is not not a view shared by all the researchers on the global warming, the effects of the current changes are not too important or too serious, they are not therefore no danger and, finally, the efforts made to to influence the development of climate is unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably high.

Bolek Polívka has lost the dispute to the subject of the mark Valašské království, Kingdom of Valašsko --.
On after the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it is really he who was used for the first time the King title of Valašsko, but the project has been set up by the team around of Tomáš Harabiš, former member of the player.
Polívka does not was not present at the hearing of aujourd'hui.
However, that his lawyer, the issue is probably not over and his client will appeal.
" The issue is the fact that Mr Harabiš and his team parasitent on the popularity of Bolek Polívka, " said after the trial the lawyer of Polívka.
In it, the Kingdom words of Valašsko reference to the whole world precisely this player and funny.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
" It is behind us a work of almost 10 years.
In research of the money and of implementation to the point of events " has -t he said.
In after him, it is the money which is the cause of dispute.
" After years, they themselves are made aware that the project has of success and that they could in take advantage.
It is them who want parasiter on our work ", has -t he added.
A lucrative business
In the court, it is Polívka who has used for the first time the title valašský král, King of Valašsko -- in the emission television.
The player Radoslav Brzobohatý the was crowned King in 1993.
However, at the time, it did not of the report with the project of setting up a country shadow.
A few years more late, Harabiš came with the idea of do seem of the passports of Valašské Království.
In an action comedy to the origin it in is left a business and a commercial activity profitable, followed of the creation, by Harabiš, of the society Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka has accepted that his name and his signature are mentioned in the passport and it has even proposed to the holders of balances on the price of the visit of the firm and of its theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Aujourd'hui, the judge has also mentioned that Harabiš is that use the idea naked, published by Polívka in the emission manéž, to the commercial purposes.
" The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainemement helped the project Valašské království, " said the judge.
It has added however that the soul of the project was formed by Harabiš and his team which is used to the draft a major.
The cooperation between the parties aujourd'hui the enemy is had until 2000 when Harabiš had to Polívka a result official to Vsetín.
But at of here, of conflicts have started to be more between Polívka has Harabiš, who have led with the statement " the King Boleslav 1 elected for always ".
The role leader in the Kingdom has been then, in the spirit of Harabiš, taken by the singer Jarmila Šuláková in the Queen mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka was complaint against Harabiš and its society, the request that the court has aujourd'hui rejected.
It which could take to clear the case, it is the tournament plans to the throne and a half of the Princess.
It should in get a new King.
It was not not even fulfil the details and the date.

It is action as the parade of the kings to Slovácko.
The King is elected for a certain time.
Even Mr Polívka can of course be ", has added Harabiš.
The Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: diparition of prejudice
In fact say, I does not have never been a great fan of the Peugeot 206.
His qualities of the rotation was not of extraordinary, the quality of change of pace, of the conduct and also that of the production could, in many ways, be qualified to lower to the average.
However, now it is on the market his successor the Peugeot 207 who, it, is much better.
On as more that the combi appointed SW is still a step more far, it not is more that to consider.
When I testais the hatchback classic of the Peugeot 207 I am plaignais by the example of the area for the lead on the seats of behind.
So that there over the complaints because that the body combi means that even the major dozen will, in this respect, to the home.
Will be done quickly
I shall refer very quickly the internal to do not too me repeat.
It is of a design to no near managed, my only comment on on the tunel central who me is poor.
Here, I would like a design a little more inventive, is given that the car has the so elegant air.
The seats are comfortable and the time that we can complain of seats or of issues too short is over.
The control latéral this is also considerably improved by the report to the model 206.
As the area, the increase of the dimensions of the body is sensitive here also.
The combi is disappear also the lack of place over the head already mentioned.
A boot in the boot
The most important on the vehicle, it is therefore its soutte to luggage.
I must see it as very much open, also thanks to the ice pivotante back -- and of a stowage rather easy.
The dark areas are with of elastic of the ruling which is a good compromise.
It does not is not substantial and can be extended all in is capable of taking of objects asez heavy.
But let us in volume.
It is, in the tables, 428 l in the form of basis, this who is by the competition a figure than the way.
The Implementation to share the Škoda Fabia Combi, vehicle the more sale of this category in Czech.
If the we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, we see that the Peugeot is very much behind, the difference with 52 litres.
When is of from in leave to the foreign or many of take a buggy, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the benefits, I would the victims of cash remaining after the overthrow of the issues of seats back quite right, or of a marche-pied very low.
120 horses divided on four cylindres
The car that we have tested was fitted to a motor Otto of four cylindres with a volume of 1.6 the and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact say, it is to that that should be a 1.6 who is walk a hatchback family.
It is silent, consume little and, especially, it is well.
If I compare with the same product by Škoda which is often the impression of having a bush of emissions closed by a serpillère, then I am in be that enthusiastic.
Parcourons the tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that the it has tested a car very well equipped, with a spacious home and a good engine.
The price of the basis of a vehicle with a motor Otto 1.4 gallons amounting to 329 900 Kč is still passable.
The vehicle that we have tested is to start of 410 900 Kč, this which is already enough.
The equipment Premium, also tested, increasing the price of 80 000 Kč.
However, we have had in more of airbags head, of an automatic air-conditioning, of essuis-glace automatic, of an automatic control of windows precaution. ..
In reality, the vehicle is at the end of account 531 900 Kč.
It is much, but trying to add to the price of the Fabia the extra equipment and you get a very similar figure.
It is not therefore more than to choose the mark.
The integration of pupils Slovakia in the schools britaniques is not
The number of children from of the countries of Europe of is it in the schools britaniques is growing, this who is in the demeurants of concerns on the development of the local education.
The integration of Europe of is it has, for the moment, to a series of obstacles.
The schools britaniques see even of cases where of conflict between immigrants and descendants of the people of origin become in the violence.
The case of Kent of the north, which begin to grow the conflict opponents demeurants and immigrants of origin Slovak example of the problem of the integration of children from of the Europe of is it.
The case, the harassment and the fights between the students themselves have implemented in the relations between the parents.
The situation has gone so far that the police has arrested at Chatham a woman Slovak who struck with an iron bar a is agé of 10 years.
The culprit is defending in saying that the boy the was insulted by comments rasistes.
The police has had also be after the attack against an immigrant Slovak led by two teenagers.
The young girls were allegedly sent to the rights of the comments racist and he had thrown of stones.
" When we returning to the house, a young has risen on the end of the bus and began to we taking over.
As I have said to him to stop, it has responded by potatoes and of pears and then it has found his backside ", said another adventure unpleasant a mother of pupils Slovakia.
The complaints are made by the two parties.
The a of demeurants came to describe the conflict with the immigrants of the fight for survival.
The cases mentioned above are that the atmosphere in the schools britaniques between the people of origin and the immigrants is to be held.

Cuba, the most beautiful island of Caribbean
For the visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
All this that you expect of your leave can be if you made a good choice.
The beaches gold and white as snow, of high waves and then a calm sea as a Etang.
There palmes and the all inclusive with servers you offering on the beach a pizza, of the ice or of of cocktails enivrants.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the roulette.
On the islands of the sea of Caraîbes, you does not will not find This only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, it did is that one island on which you will still much more and it is Cuba, the most important and the most beautiful island of Broad Antilles.
At the time of Spanish, Cuba has been the bastion of invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus the was described as the best place that the human eye does not has never seen.
The Havana is become the time and the place of goods of treasures that the Spanish have been stolen and that they take in Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional has been made in all the beginning of years 20'.
It is Lucky Luciano, the one of the leaders of the American mafia, which the has been building, since all this which was a crime to US, especially in the ban -- was accepted and supported to Cuba, the drugs, the games of chance, the prostitution.
Parmis its customers, it is were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, of buildings in level have pushed and of cars, from the secular symbols of years 50' of the last century, had on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway has bought a property in San Francisco of Paula, near the Havana, and, to Cojímar, it was his yacht.
The stars of showbusiness and of the men policies of America full from their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And aujourd'hui then?
You can give you your autographe on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, we you mixera the cocktail of your choice.
And these cars worship are always to the Havana, since the jigoulis and the fiats previously imported have already for long, in a climate if salé and wet, wrong.
Of that the Havana, especially the part the more former, is significantly decrepit, nullepart elsewhere in the place it there all of the colonial buildings splendid that it is in has precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
In given that the tourism is the money if necessary, its development has the green fire.
In the last 15 years, of new hotels led not only to the Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of the province Holguín, and also on the small islands such that Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and of others.
Cuba is still a fantasy that is unique in the world and who will be seen especially in the interests of small trains.
The cane is gone for the planting areas in the factories on a road close by small trains to the situation and to the engine.
Their equipment traveling there has not been renewed for dozens of years and it is and that the can we are seeing in the way of small engines which the present are also only in museums.
To which move its not?
The majority of visitors do not the places the more well-known.
It there is therefore no need to in writing long on Varadero or of on the Havana.
Otherwise recall that in the ownership of Hemingway, already mentioned, it is a museum and that those who like this writer not should not miss the visit.
The valley of Viňales to the west of the island is the one of the corners the more fanciful of Cuba.
A vegetation exhubérante is pushing on the ground limestone.
The mogotes, of balls limestone and of rocks amount in the situation of the bottom of the valley, and, of the fertile land is being taken in their sandpits, even its rotten rock are covered of a carpet plant very heavy.
The valley is the place where we grow probably the Cuban tobacco of better quality.
You can meet the final form of the product if you visit the a of the factories of cigars of Havana.
They will perhaps also interesting that it is here that to been turned the Chilean episode in Major nature.
Trinidad
Former City based lack of time after that the Spanish have colonised the island.
It is the market the trafficking of slaves and those of sugar who have given to him the glory and the wealth.
The wealth has's in the beauty and the nature ville-vitrine of this city of the size reduced.
Koloniální španělská architektura, výrazně ovlivněná pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky, is za čtyři staletí téměř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the huge mountain Escambray, is a place at this point to the gap that still in the years 50' of the last century, it there not of road that run this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation it has been of remain of hand.
It was not nothing, and that is why we not démolissait nothing not more, we are restricted to have a roof over the head.
If the it has, to Trinidad, most of the time that a afternoon, then it is the death of go see also of places interessants in place, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the valley of Sucreries.
Then, the evening, it is of practice to go to the Casa of the Música who is taking after the bed of the sun and where the music not be assourdit that to the small morning.
Baracoa
Some points this village located at the Eastern end of Cuba as the greatest of the island.
This opinion is certainly influenced already by the way who is leading.
The two roads who are fighting for Guantanamo should take of the high mountains and accidentées and are a landscape almost no evidence of the human activity.
UNESCO has put the East problem of Cuba, thanks to the countryside intact, on the list of heritage world.
We are doing the best chocolate, to the church, it is the cross of Christopher Columbus, in reality, it was the day to no nearly 100 years after the tour of the sea -- and for the hill where is the former chateau-fort and the current hotel El Castillo, we see some table mountain, which the most famous is El Yunque.
On the subject of coffee, of rum, of cigars, of mass mountainous Sierra Maestra, of the Bay of sows and of the Isla island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctity of the holy patrone of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, of the Santeria, of religions African countries by the descendants of former slaves, on all that we could meet a number of pages.
However, as you said precisely, it is more see a time.

Unless of five weeks of the end of the year, the investors are delighted already the hands in hoping the arrival of traditional racing of the end of the year.
However, this year the experts do not are not also certain that it will happen.
Banif believes that " the point of view statistics, the months of December in exchange generally has a positive attitude.
However, it can not be of forecasts exclusively based on the statistics, since that is given the present context, the uncertainties threatening on the markets, in less on the short term ".
Although they do not are not supporters to the stock take of the impetus for the recent weeks of the year, the experts are saying that " the market stock feeds through the existence of liquidity, prepared to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, particularly the income set, affected by the effect of the brain to the values of the quality both in the long periods that in the short ".
For this, they believe that the grant will something rather latéral, not free of volatilités " especially because we do not is not the impact of the fall likely of the rate of the EDF, is given the high level of oil and the danger of the promotion of tensions inflationary "
Javier Barrio, head of sales of BPI in Spain, is to agreement on the fact that this does not is not the right time to say that it is a racing.
" This is not the best thing ", assure the expert.
The Ibex, the index stock Spanish, has lost nearly 4% for the 8 November when the index has closed to 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts have this so negative view.
Juan Solana, analyst of Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could end the year to 16 points with the reorganization of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the systems of pensions which are all the years during these dates.
However, the expert point that the things are a little different this year he believes that the racing will place to start of the second week of December, after the bridge of the celebration of the Constitution, the 6 December --.
The analyst does not that the volatility affect the trend of the market.
For its part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, estimated that we are near the technical levels and " c'est why we could see a events of the index that could be caused by the office of the information which are of the European Union in the consequences of the crisis on the market of money ".
The analyst hope that they are positive.
The analysts are of the agreement to choose the values which are the responsibility to lead the Ibex to news cottes maximum.
Solana, of Intermoney, states that " this year the great values are of return for him ".
The expert included in the portfolio the two major banks and some manufacturers " because that when the date approaches, the electrical sector will good ".
While that, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco ensure that the increases will of the bank and the industrial sector.
The constructrices will also be of this racing, in the cases where they if there are.
" the ACP for several months recuperating of positions and we hope that the other constructrices as Ferrovial and FCC suiveront the way ", is the expert.
The consumer cyclical will lead in the last part of the year due to the increase of sales in the sales season of Christmas.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technological companies will also very much, much that in this case it not is not much of representation on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
During the last seven years, only in two occasions the months of December has been a month baissier.
The racing genuine of the end of the year took place in 2003, the year in which the financial markets are out of the crisis caused by the construction of the technological bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 has recovered 28.17% , the months of dicembre has been an increase of 6.68% .
We will see whether 2007 is the fifth year running of gains, for the time the Ibex has increased of 8.36% since January -- and if it succeeds to computer on his racing of the end of the year.

In the same way, in using of census, the companies have concluded that the married people have a tendency to be less of accidents that the drivers single.
The use that the is one of the vehicle will on the frequency, and therefore on the likelihood for a accident.
In increasing the frequency the likelihood increase.
They are many the variables that the insurers take into account at the time for the price of premium.
It is for this, that the driver is well study the situation to choose the car insurance which is were the better to its profile.
We will here the variables the more significant to the time of choose the a or the other type of insurance, for that it, in most of adapt to the characteristics of the insurer, it is a reasonable price.
The young people of less of 25 years must be with various disadvantages in time of need a contract with a insurance to an accessible price, as can be the little experience in the conduct and the number of permits of lead.
Although the right to be well assured is a insurance to any risk, of other options more economic exist.
The drivers the more far-sighted can opt for a insurance any risk with openness, of the way to what they have the security of the insurance to any risk but at a price more accessible.
This form of agreement means that the customer paid a part of the amount of damage.
" The part of the amount of claims that the customer pays be established in terms of the value of the premium, which is higher than the amount is weak ", says Luis Noguera, the head in Spain of First Europe, Ombudsman of insurance on-line.
Another option is the insurance to third enlarged, of the way to this that the customer ensure the protection to be given to the damage caused to others, but by for those caused on his car.
In more, it is covered against the flight, the fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A Council.
If you are minor of 25 years essaies to be careful and to avoid the claims in the extent of possible, because it is passed on the subsidy, can reduce the price of the insurance to the future.
A subsidy is a reduction of tariff of basis that has the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a increase of tariff of basis.
" The subsidies and the sanctions will of the company and from of it.
If the company has been a good year it will be possible to increase the subsidies ", have Noguera.
In addition of 25 years it is easier for the drivers at the time of get a contract with insurance, as the rate of accidents is reduced by the experience gained.
It is for this reason that it is better of choose a insurance any risk with honesty.
" Normally the young people not not use of the experience in advance gained after an accident ", has the director of the company Union in Spain and added that the majority of the accidents occur during the second year of conduct, a time past the ' fear of newcomer '.
However, if the customer is married but did not even of children it is better that it negotiate a insurance to any risk, of momento that its economic situation the allows him.
The marriages with children are regarded by the insurers as are the people with the rate of accidents the lower, because the charges are more vulnerable.
In this case the best insurance is a insurance to any risk with honesty, can be of 300 euros )- or a insurance to third enlarged to leave of the third year of life of the vehicle when the market has of a high level of subsidy.
" They have a conduct more relaxed and they have a greater power of the purchase to allow the luxury to take a lot more important of customs ", judge Luis Noguera.
For the pensioners a insurance to all the risk with the openness is better, in is it of 150 euros )- or a asurance to third enlarged when the insurer has of a high level of subsidy.
It must say that the car insurance is a thing of importance, not just because it is the driver with to possible claims, but also because it is an important expenditure, it is to this that it is essential to consider carefully the assurance that we should the more in our own situation.

The atmosphere of Venus could be the future of the world.
The scientists have yesterday said that Venus has certainly been a good world to live.
The data from the vessel European in limbo have shown that the world is certainly two times smaller than the earth, as it that the it was before.
Venus is the world the more closely of the earth.
These two worlds are all of the same size, with the similar order, although Venus is closer of the Sun.
The scientists believe now that it is of billions of years, Venus could have been of conditions similar to those of the world, and may even have been live.
But the greenhouse effect had to the dioxide of carbon, the erosion air dûe the solar radiation alliance to a rotation more slow led Venus to all a different kind of development.
Aujourd'hui the world is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and of storms of lightning and has a surface of the temperature too hot to continue this the lead.

Still open to all
Mitt Romney has said will not be to the task as candidate to the Presidency, to the issues of evidence of snow.
Despite this, the Republican candidate to the Presidency have finally accepted of participate in the debate of you Tube, during which of many voters ordinary have made their issues, the subject to the candidate.
Wednesday evening 28 November, any of the issues raised there was also ridiculous that the outcome of another debate of you Tube, when a evidence of snow has asked the Democrats their position by the report to the warming of the planet.
But this time here, the questions and the answers have much reflected the conditions of party republican, candidate for the next elections.
It is is not on what criteria, the producers of CNN, who has sponsorisé the debate, have chosen the clips of you Tube to show the candidates candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the more long addressing of one issue, has focused on the immigration.
The issue is one of the issues the strong for the Republicans.
CNN has asked to some voters of telephone they can of the things pleasant, The rule has been of increases of approval when the candidates are talking of the big way.
The exchange the harder and the more long of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr Romney who is in charge of important elections early of the Iowa and of New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani has tried of put in attention the fact that it was untroubled to end of the illegal immigration in his office of the mayor of New York.
It has attacked Mr Romney, accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts, to use of the illegal immigrants in him.
The fighters have become particularly severe when it their has asked if they are ready to promote a ' amnésia ", with the illegal a regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens --.
The candidate minors as Duncan Hunter, a Congressman California, and Tom Tancredo, a Congressman of Colorado, have managed to discuss this issue.
None of them did the opportunity to be elected, but all two remain in the race, can be with the fact that they have begun to combat the immigration before and of a more effective than the other.
A general way, the candidate, at least on the immigration, have the same views, of borders more rigid, and tolerance zero for the illegal immigrants.
This issue, ally to the concerns raised in particular by the case of the toxic toys made in China, and many other concerns to the outside world, help the Republicans to forget, or to minimize the divisions between the libertarians and the Conservative Catholics.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when of other matters have been raised.
Mr Giuliani has asked why it had previously supported the campaign for control of weapons.
John McCain and Mr Romney have discussed to know if to of the water in the nose should be seen as a torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidate believed in its entirety, to the content of the Bible.
It has led Mr Giuliani to dare say that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it does not is not on of believe in the history of Mr and the whale.
Another speaker has asked if Jesus have been in favor of the death of death.
It not be expected not to see Mike Huckabee, , in pole position in Iowa in a recent election, with its Christian conservatism of long time, said that the death of death is painful of that necessary.
When it has made to know if Jesus have been in favor, it has made to laugh and has said that Jesus is too smart to present to the elections.
The human race is insolitement open to all.
The increase of Mr Huckabee in Iowa line with the recent potential of research of subsidies conducted by the libertarian Ron Paul, and the sifflements in the debate of Wednesday.
These two there are émergés of nothing, thanks to the fact that the protection of the party does not are not to be of agreement to decide who is the candidate more experienced and more traditionalist.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unifia the party of good time and of the way convincing with a message of success on the field US closer and the leaders.
This time however, the party is divided and the result is not to be clear.
The pain of Travaillistes
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole in which could, Even if it démissionnait, the situation does not change not.
Given the tendency of scandals British, it is not very lucrative.
Not of decorations sold, or of the bills of the hotel Paris of politicians, not of the finger of up outside wedlock sucé.
But is that a revelation is that a rich man of the case would masked for four years, under false names, its contributions to the current the Labour Party, equivalent to more of £650.000, $1.3m )- that the party does not have not declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown is in would of the past.
It is two months, the Prime Minister has been running back in the draft of the election, insulting recklessly the British intelligence saying that the polls of opinion does not have not influenced his decision, and that it hoped to the opposite, offer a government compact and effective.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant leader Liberal democrat, has said that the terrifying Brown has turned of Stalin to Mr Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty to the board of the crash, has shown a gap of directives and a poor judgment in case of emergency.
The inadequate proposals in favor of change the code of taxes have led a coalition of groups industrial against the government.
The loss of 25 millions of the personal data of the part of the authorities of taxes, has been an incredible cock-up administrative.
A trio of general to the pension have launched a revolt among the Lords, protest against the cuts of the military expenditure that they have declared that be Minister of defense is for them, a employment to the partial time.
At the present time, the suspicion of donations lack of the part of David Abrahams, Mr Watt, the Secretary General of Travaillistes, and its former head of the vigilance -- have the fact that they have had resign.
None of this means that Brown is moving up to the end.
However the government can get to a point where it is impossible to govern.
The people like not the politicians, and did not trust in them, but not in general their doubts of hand in that a new government is in power.
It seems clear that a Prime Minister can not improve the situation, or even running for long, in that it may the suspension, the public administration does more, the offices of Ministers are the results, the research press of bad stories; and the government is on the defensive and without more no objective.
In a sense, the position of Mr Brown is particularly difficult, because contrary to other leaders policy, it not not be proud to be a beginning.
Although it would repudiate Tony Blair, it has all of even been his Lieutenant Governors.
The problems relating to the Northern Rock and the data of taxes by example, are linked to the decisions of Mr Brown taken when was Chancellor of the British treasury.
And even if it does not is not directly involved in the misfortunes of Blair, as the long investigation on the funds of party ' of the money with for members of the House of Lords ', the voters would think the opposite.
But the difficult situation that has Brown does not is not so tragic that it in has the air.
The blunders are not so monstrous as the members of the party of Tories the are believe.
As in Mr Bean, it there is no victim or fraud.
And the cure, although that painful, could be of make the Stalinist trends in Brown of always, in favor of a government reliable and slightly brutal.
The new scandal on the donations policies is a good example.
Mr Abrahams, a man very particular, which compared its donations to the charity, said that it does not want any public recognition of the charity.
It can have its opinion, but this does not to him of decide.
The laws against the anonymity of large subventionneurs of politicians are clear, and they are for a good reason: The public has the right of know that contributes to the success of those who governing the country.
Mr Watt, who has said be in the course of the programs of Mr Abrahams, unaware that it was illegal, will by result be asked, of even of elsewhere that Jon Mendlesohn, the head of the collection of subsidies which had spoken of donations coming in October.
But yet Brown does not is not involved: There is not think that it has been in the course of action, even if the majority of payments made have been made to the continuation of his arrival to the government in June.
Now the Prime Minister has made the middle.
It has quickly condemned the legislative gap of the party, but he did not drawn the attention on the fact that the power of decision based on a thing that we know well, to appeal to a committee of inquiry on this matter composed of a Bishop to the pension and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, is it the responsibility of the police.
In more, it is has many other things that Brown should be, so that find a permanent chairman to the committee independent of Standards of life public, without leader for six months, and prepare a good reform on the financial of the political parties.
It would the party Labour, in a moment of weakness, to work with the Tories, this which could the lead to abandon its financial report particular with the federations, in fact, a bitter pill for a supporter as Brown.
But it should take some facts supporters.
The party of Conservatives have now of a common advantage for the elections, it has two years to recover the voters, and the only way to achieve a victory is of show a watertight integrity and of the strong powers.
Escroqueries of cards.
The crisis of mortgages contaminerait it the market US some credit cards.
When it is of blood in the water, it is normal of see of fins attisées, tourbillonner around.
Now that the market of the American property is a critical stage, the predators are to the market US some credit cards.
The analysts of in Goldman Sachs believe that the losses linked to the cards of credit could achieve $99 billion if the infection is spreading of mortgages to other forms of credit to the consumer.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
It is of increases in the rates of costs and of bankruptcy, this who can the shares of stock not recoverable or who are, more of 30 days after.
HSBC said the last month that it has taken $1.4 billion in its money to the consumer, in part to cause of the weakness of people of cards.
It is all of itself too early to panic.
The costs and the insolvencies are still moderate.
In Moody, a fiscal agency, the rate of the insolvency of 3.89% of troixième quarter is lower of almost a point by the report to its historic average.
The deterioration of the rate is in part explainable by technical factors.
A change of legislation in 2005 to US, on the personal bankruptcy has caused an abrupt fall of archives of bankruptcy, which in turn led to heavy losses for the credit cards, the number of archives, and therefore of the rate of bankruptcy -- could increase even if the conditions of loans had increased.
The industry announced in addition of rates of payment fixed, who are in relief the amount of debt month that the consumer must deal.
And the confidence in the sureté of the capital of cards of credit is relatively strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of the structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research society, has predicted that the volume of program for 2007 is 25% higher in the last year.
The direct links of infection between the crisis of mortgages and the market some credit cards are certainly, the consumers could opt to increase their indebtedness now that the loans building fair have disappeared.
But the issuers of cards are more attention to the flow of cash rather than to the value of assets, and therefore the fall of price of the property did not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even be of benefit to the issuers of securities of credit.
The premiums to consumers for the payment of mortgages fall if the properties are less than the value of the loan, with the result, the debt by card of credit would a priority to repay the whole.
The issuers of cards are capable of respond much more quickly that the mortgage and with most of the flexibility to such conditions of crisis, because they can change the rate of interest or alter the limits of rédit.
It should in theory reduce the risk for a quick resumption of action.
' We do not we open a morning and review all loans. ' has said Gary Perlin, the director of the Capital One.
If a financial disaster of the market of cards of credit is unlikely, it is of strong risk for a consistent reduction.
If the lower price of the property and a contraction in the market of credit lead the America to the recession, the industry will certainly do with a future macabre.
Make much attention to the fins dorsales. .
The British bankers plead guilty in the Enron case.
The three bankers British who should go show their roles in a fraud committed by the previous director financial of Enron, Mr Andrew Fastow, have changed their statement, calling guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew is were to declared innocent of seven charges for the alleged fraud collusoire in 2000, made by Fastow in a financial fraud secret order of this wealth in spite of their employees.
They should come to the court in January.
But during a hearing headed by the American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they themselves are all found guilty of having committed a fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the group PLC of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous everywhere in Britain to cause of procedures of extradition who have taken two years.
The US, their case is still a question in abeyance for the investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The accusations that they were imposed in 2002, did understand to Fastow that it was the subject of the investigation of the government in the collapse of Enron.
The charges against the bankers, so-called the " three of Natwest " say be came to Houston in 2000, to hold a scenario fraudulent with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.

The financial markets soaring to London, New York and everywhere in Europe after that Donald Kohn, No 2 after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said that those who decide, must be ' flexible and pragmatic ' in their actions in the financial markets concern.

These comments are the investors as a clear signal that the the Federal Reserve is prepared to invest of new capital in the American markets, which to further reductions of the rate of interests could stabilize the conditions of credit.
These remarks have also been of calm Wall Street with news even more bad on the American economy, so that the more big decline of sales property for the month of October.
The repercussions of this crisis financial has been heightened following the declaration of Bear Stearns, bank of investment, announcing that it licenciera 650 people, it est-à-dire, 4% of its staff, to reduce the cost to offset the heavy losses dûes to the bets losers of loans property.

The England is with a call to the judgment by the report to the criticism of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, the a also difficult that the other.
Who will the batteur 6 for England to Kandy this week the end, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in the context also large that the first Test against Sri Lanka, which will the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of sélectionneurs who was here once to help Mr Moores, chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to take its decision, and because that the office of Hugh Morris, the President Director General of England, is to meet the forms of application to become a manager national, in less from time.
Anyone who does not will not to win the dossard 6 is unfortunate, but the life is often unfair and the sport the is also.
It is never easy to destroy this who can to a man to reach the top of his profession for that a further will not never addition the lower level, sometimes because of the chance more than because of power.
It there is not that in cricket that the selection is difficult, because in the end, the ruling is subjective.
East the right time to do emerge Bopara?
Is it right for the report to Shah.
The same thing could be proposed in another context, who choose between John Edwards or Banerjee ' tubby '? , all two, the new framework has been of good qualifications, professional, should be promoted, but it there of place that for one of them.
Who has the right of determining the appropriate level of a cricketeur to less that we give him at least a chance?
The figures have their importance in the decisions, but also the opportunities.
In the internal of a team, a cricketeur must catch the œil of captain, in the same time it must take the door and a batteur must be lucky to reach the cricketeur of a day.
But catching the eyes of sélecteurs is much more complicated.
Many have more is the last season, for example, James Anderson who was some of play the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison has said in full form and continued of this entrainer to be.
Anderson took 32 gates of the first class on 33 rounds to win a place.
Chris Tremlett has not taken that 29 to the average, but all two have already been their moment of glory in the greater level and hope offer still.
If it will Shah or Bopara who will at Asgiriya, it is not only a question of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build the career of a man, but it is the lack of difference.
It is four years, Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty have played in every Test and has succeeded well in the first, with five doors and 40 tour useful, but it was Paul Collingwood, who fought also to emerge, who has managed to become the cricketeur important of Test, and it, despite the fact that his double hundred marked against the Australia in Australia can be still under estimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following a different debate after the session of aujourd'hui at Asgiriya, will certainly their instincts Conservatives and promote the greater experience of Shah against the exuberance of young Bopara.
The two have of good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his excellent and important beginning in innings of Test of 88 to Mumbai, 32 cents of first class against six for Bopara, which to 22ans is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking to the launch.
But Shah did the fact that 10 rounds in its two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, its city of player of Middlesex, and that, the immediate rejection by the sélectionneurs when Vaughan to new in the form, réclama its place for the next match, seems have afflicted its progress so obvious to Mumbai.
Unlike him, the player of Essex is full of joy of living.
There not it is the fear on a cricket ground and it has got when it has recently fallen on a 4x4 at a presentation of Volkswagen, sponsor of the England.
It does not has postponed that of light injuries, was shocked, even if the first thing that it has done was to its Vodafone, along well on -- and call Alastair Cook, its équipier who had of far, to ask him's ' 'il was it? '
Bopara is of far the best batteur, its way filante it is of do of the services that it will, and that it has with confidence and professionnalité.
Choosing the right people is a thing, choose the good time in is another.
Can be is that the true art of the selection?
I am able to give its chance to Bopara, this who do not want not say that Shah must not not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who will this week end.
The bus bring the people to work, and to fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus full of the Iraqi refugees from of Syria is come to Baghdad yesterday, shedding the exiles without money and without renewal of visa, or of others still who hope that the city has been the norm.
Some are income to fight against the militants who have them away from home.
In the bus station Mansur, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses of a government official, the terminal was full of refugees of Syria and of Jordan who are revenue from their resources.
' I have decided to go in Syria after they have killed some doctors to Baghdas ' said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a doctor Sunni.
' I am returned aujourd'hui because I have seen in the papers and read in the newspapers that which happened to Baghdâd and given that the city is safer now. '
«Ils say that the army Mahdi do not making more of crimes. ' has -t he said, is reference to the militia Shia of militant clergyman Moqtada al-Sadr, who has imposed to its men of this back to the time.
Qassim al Atwani, a teacher Shia of 38 years of the area of Amariyah dominated by the Sunni, is returned with his children, because it could not more renew his visa Syrian and because the regime prevents the Iraqi of work.
Its neighbors of Shia to Amariyah the have called for informing it that the militia helped by the US, has been of hunting Al-Qaeda of the west of the capital, and the have invited to return.
One of the new arrivals of Jordan is the leader of a tribe Sunni and Shia who had left his home in north of Baghdâd to cause of the attack to the grenades after he has led the people to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But it should return to combat.
' it is two days, some of my friends have called to me and I have said have put in place a militia against Al-Qaeda to Sleikh, and they have need of me and of my boys. '
' This why I am aujourd'hui ' has said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, of 62 years.
Many say have attracted by the calm growing of the capital since that the American troops have arrived, and in the view of the training continues of ' groups of people involved ' well armed and cooperation with the military US to defend their neighborhood.
But still of others say have been forced of return to the cause of the problem of visa and of the decline of the capital of Damascus, where most of 1.3 million of Iraqi have fled the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, the father of three children, said the distrust felt by all to issue of visas for nationals that Nouri al-Maliki, the first Minister Shia, who have called on the Syrian government of limit to force the people to return to the country.
Over the millions of two and half of people have fled the country to cause of squads sectarian of the death.
' we did not of the problem until it that al-Maliki has in Syria and urging the government to do more to of visas to Iraqi, to force them to return in Iraq ' said the pensioner Sunni.
' I am not be confidence in a government that supports the criminals who have burned my house when I am party '.
The reduction of violence can be in part explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven of areas of Shia and vice versa, creation of places where the tensions are lower.
It fears that a sudden influx of refugees does not increase to new the sectarian tensions and bring the fighting.
A Saarland, good training.
The more small state federal government in the area of education professionelle, and is even of by the international orientation of its schools higher.
It is only in the area that a deficit weighs on the sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
" J'ai exliqué yesterday for the 50th time in a non-sarrois, that we do not are not of French ", it is the slogan that the more small state federated, by self-mockery, poster for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, the France and the Luxembourg play a great role in the training system of Saarland, system which is placed fifth in the monitor of training of the Institute of the German economy in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, the higher schools cooperate closely with the country neighbors.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
So far, the students have the opportunity to conclude this their studies by a double, and a triple bill.
Witness the quotitée high of 15.6 percent of the foreign students.
The Saarland led by elsewhere it also the children of the country to schools higher in the higher number to the average, many of them without a degree of Gymnasium.
" In Saarland, we take the system of the vocational training ", said his Plünnecke, expert in training in IW.
More of a young on five gets its way of studies in a vocational school, and the Saarland is to more of seven points at the top of the national average.
As the possibilities of combination of training professional and academic are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of people, the panel of double course is the second best of Germany.
Despite a training practice and a demand growing, the number of diplomés in engineering has also fallen to a third in recent years.
That why the Ministry of education sarrois has forced the schools than to a marketing campaign in the areas of science of the engineer.
" After the first studies PISA, we have seen a great number of reforms in the general schools. ", said a spokesman of the Ministry of the education.
As the government has introduced throughout the federal state of tests of comparison.
For the children are more quickly to learn, the last year of crêche is free of law, a model that the meantime of other states federal copy also.
Only of future studies of comparison can be if the performance of students are improve of the sustainable way.
In the PISA study in 2003, the end of students to risk has reduced from 29 to 20 percent.
In total however, the Saarland not this is not improved as that of other states federal.
The Bavarian this in do more.
And to the great disappointment of sarrois, the knowledge in the foreign languages are not measured by the PISA study, we could otherwise gain of points in this area.
Because the language of neighbor is compulsory in the colleges, even if the sarrois are not of French.
Chávez the rule the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon tic-tac that that in the rest of the world.
The 9 December, the President Hugo Chavez will back the clock of an hour in the country America.

Uribe would " typical in the face " of Venezuela with this decision, were criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain also Chávez is in all the people.
A new bell of mobile phone is the end in the country, " Por qué No you callas ", why not you stop you not -- is the sentence that already more of a half of people have téléchargé on the Internet.
It has been decided by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, in the most recent summit ibéro-américain, was annoyed with the constant questions of populists of left and that it has said of silence.
A reduction of wages threat the Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economy, in the future, a real moins-value of pay threat the workers German this year.
Some experts have been quoted all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
In a calculation of the Foundation Hans-Böckler, the employees should be in 2007 to a real reduction on the statement of pay by the year earlier.
" The fault is to the low development of wages, to the increase of the Tax on the value added and the increases of prices of products food and of the energy ", said Gustav the Horn of Institute for the macro-économie and the research on the situation, to the newspaper " Bildt ".
New charges could also speak in terms of assurance-chômage for the employee.
The Minister of finance Peer Steinbrück said to the newspaper " Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " that the reduction planned of the assurance-chômage of 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However the national Agency for the employment does not has more the right of find in the embarrassment for to the Federation of funds or of the financial aid, in the words of politician of the SPD.
It has been Tuesday that the explosion of the prices of products food and of oil had pushed the rate of inflation to its highest level for 13 years.
In total, the prices have increased of 3.0 percent of a year to the other.
Venus is the twin circle of the earth.
Despite the atmosphere hostile to life, Venus is more to the world that this that we believed until now, the probe space Union " Venus Express " has found of lightning in the atmosphere and of tourbillons of wind to the poles, like to those who are in winter on earth.
For nearly three decades, the scientists are that it is of lightning on Venus.
The probe Union " Venus Express " in has aujourd'hui given the evidence, it has detected of the electromagnetic waves to the limit of the atmosphere, the lightning on Venus had to a height of about 56 km of strangers by strangers, reported Christopher Russel of the University of California at Los Angeles in the magazine scientific " Nature ".
In the well-known theory of the cyprine, the lightning have been seen the life on earth, the orage would boost of reactions in the sea who have led to the training of acids amino, part of light of life.
It is not the case on Venus, " If the life it is has been, it must have been to date long of the history ", is Sean Solomon of the " Carnegie institution " to Washington.
It should not occur aujourd'hui not of things living to the surface of Venus, the atmosphere is about 100 times more dense that on the earth, it there sometimes of temperatures of 500 degrees.
" Venus is perhaps the twin reports of the world, but it is a twin ", said Russel.
Why Venus, who is so to the world in quantity and size, has been hit of development also different, is the fundamental question of the Space mission.
The start of " Venus Express " in November 2005 was an important step in the research vénusienne, as more no probe was in the road for the exploration of the world for years quatre-vingt 10.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent results of research who have been now presented in some articles of " Nature " does not make not only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
They are also that the common points with the world of our planéte neighbor are more than expected in first.
So the researchers have found, alongside the tourbillons of wind déja been at the center north, a cold of clouds in the area south, which is still much more quickly.
The phenomenon remind the currents of air in the hemispheres land in the winter, said a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planéte of sytème solar has almost the same amount that the earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres, almost too great.
The planéte qualified of the star of the evening or of morning turn around the sun in all just 225 days.
It is however much more slowly on itself, a day vénusien has 243 days people.
Of that Venus, with temperatures in the area of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, do not would not the world, the scientists are that the two planétes they are registered in the similar conditions.
On the two, the water has accumulated and was on the earth in the form of oceans, but has lost in the area on Venus.
And then that the carbon dioxide has set on earth in the form of carbonate, it is on Venus the greater part of the atmosphere.

We must see to it that a huge social not be contitue not also in we and they legitimised in violence.
We must take this seriously ", said it in " Neue Press " appeared to Hanover.
All young people does not would not to be in break with the rapid changes of the social reality.
The Federation, the federal states and the common were already with the determination to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
It would not not only the integration of immigrants.
" The level of integration the conference on Islam, it is already its first success. "
But it is still too early to end of warning.

In the largest efforts of integration of the part of the German government, is what was the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat was in warning against the " effects of imitation ".
The situation in Germany is certainly not as explosive that in France.
But it would still a need to act.
Kolat puts the emphasis on the fact that the quota of unemployment among the young people under the age of 25 from of the immigration would higher to the average.
It would above all ensure most of seats in the training.
Kolat insisted, " We must give the people a perspective ".
The President of the Turkish communities added however that a social control in the families had more place in Germany that in France.
Many of the youth from of the immigration do not in addition destroy this that their parents have built here.
Kolat called: " But we have when even be careful. "
It would " quickly give to the youth the opportunity of participating in work and to the training ".

In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The entry in stage utopian of the Chancellor is that the coalition in has been with the substance, and that it there more nothing to expect of it.
In any country is the Chancellor in just?
After his speech miserable in the general debate of German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, it must say, not here, not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The criticism of too focus on the policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel of the sentence harsh and arrogant.
It is provincial, has -t it said and has only shown by this that it does not understand this that want the criticism.
In Parliament, it has made visible of all to how this criticism was true.
It there is was not of interest specific or not of feelings for the problems of the country to feel.
In place, Angela be presented as a cloud, a politician in weightlessness, who fled in the foreign policy and that even this is in the à-peu-près.
For example the protection of the environment, in this regard, it is welcome even and still on the agreements of Heiligendam, but does not how the objectives on the environment will be achieved in our country.
Even, the praise of itself, have too little of modesty, the leader of CDU the would refused even two years ago.
Now it is clinging to form all made, that the growth would the people.
For where it destroyed its image of the pragmatist, which résoud the problems in place to improve the world.
But in the empire of cloud Angela, the problems of the internal policy is a there marginal.
The poverty among children and the concerns of workers to low wages?
It it is some additional sentences for it.
In this matter is significant the number of times that it is of slip when it comes to the allocation family.
Here, Merkel has need of three démarrages to make a statement to the middle states.
It swaying in the new area, at the time when it becomes practical.
The branch Attaque
In the debate of Youtube of the Republican candidate to the presidency, the frontrunners Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are to a tough battle offensive, and must now fear a candidate outsider.
The tension of candidate gets already to the first issue.
It would is of New-York a " refuge for the illegal ", accused Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
It against his side by the heavy criticism, " I say that his house was a haven for immigrants " is Giuliani and criticism to the former Governor of Massachusetts to be used of immigrants without papers.

Romney also is to the lesson vigorously by the veterans of Vietnam, when not of condemn such as a torture what it calls the " Waterboarding ", a method of interrogation where the we used the drowned.
However the fact that the important issues of the campaign are now beyond the war in Iraq and of the debate on torture is in the reactions of the common room in St.. Petersburg in Florida.
If the conservative values be leased or that the future growth of the tax are rejected, the applause brought in the auditorium.
It is there that are still a time where the weaknesses of the two frontrunners.
" J'ai made a mistake at this time ", is Romney hypocrisy and present his apologies to the basis and to the public television for in 1994 still been a supporter of abortion.
Giuliani to the opposite happening in a nœud coulant when asked his opinion on the interpretations littérales of the Bible.

A day after the withdrawal in the head of the troops, the rights of power Pakistan Musharraf has been invested in President.
In eight years of rule by the army go.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf has invested Thursday for a new term of five years.
The Pakistani television has broadcast in direct the ceremony at the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has vowed of respect the Constitution and to for the welfare of the nation.

The five soldiers were killed in the tribal region of north in the North Waziristan in an attack against a military convoy, and four others injured.
In the recommendations of the spokesman of the army, a bomb has exploded in a street near the border of Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are their return.
The supergroupes of Germany of the 1970s rejouent: the three members of the group Harmonia have of new taken their say in a concert in Berlin.
To return are subject of the records of their great success " Live 1974 ".
Even at this time, they were much more known to the foreign.
The feeling is scheduled happens then in the form of three men announced to the front of the evening.
Each has its small boite to him, its cable and before all its buttons.
Dieter Moebius, to 63 years, the throne to the environment in a white shirt as snow.
It is surrounded to the left of Michael Rother, young of 57 years and in possession of a portable computer and of a guitare.
In the right, observed by all the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years, is the curve on its say.
It contributes to the noise, including even a Beat.
And sometimes it is added by mistake to a piece of the traditional music.
It is not of course not too worried the people themselves.
The fact that the group Harmonia is of new said some distress among the fans of Krautrock.
It has the right of the report here. of polls aimed show that, certainly, the name think in the collective memory of the pop, but in any case of the way as sustainable for this group is also deeply for 32 years.
But why the German does not would it not also the right of celebrate its glamour alive of the 1970s?
On as more that this which is trompeusement " Krautrock " has always more good in England and in America that in the countries of origin.
Lorque the industry of the music has awarded in 2003 the ECHO prices to the survivors of the group of Cologne Can for them œuvre, it has been in the room the faces pop German interrogators.
When the Red Hot Chile Peppers have also thanked the groups The Dusseldorf and Neu. in the eulogy praise, the surprise was more of the limits.
The late, for the concerts, Michael Rother sautait on the stage of Red Hot Chile Peppers such as an old friend.
The problem of the ignorance home and the transfiguration in the unknown is the only and single.
The memory is of the fact déja taken by Harmonia, because the trio has not been that two years and that during this period, the power of the impact which has moved was much lower that this who it has been given by the continuation by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the name very promising of Cluster.
It joua to in the cellars in the background of the stage Berlin.
Then to Dusseldorf, for a label subsidised by the church, for the financial reasons.
Rother had briefly dépanné in Kraftwerk and is was finally made a name as guitariste with Neu. , who was at the time perhaps the group German the more radical.
In 1973, Rother followed however the musicians of Cluster in exile in the fôrets's Weserbergland.
Here, in a former firm of Weser, a destruction of the 16th century, they have lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Not ideological that in the community " Kommune I ", where Roedelius had the right of be hurt in both that alias.
Rather an artistic existence to the way of Spitzweg.
Allegedly is in the dustbin a flag of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for the art.
Many retint Harmonia far of this.
The first album is offer " Musik von Harmonia ", and the following " In Luxe ".
For also calm and small that challenging the music, the group had of poverty material.
The harvest of timber death was not not to him only to the research of itself.
The CD " Live 1974 " who has of be has been recorded during a concert to Griessem to a public record of nearly 50 heads, and that someone believes they said.
Rother made to this time the wish of force Harmonia to this result of time in time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius a requirement immoral.
The group announced their separation in 1975.
Rother atterit in the spheres of the esotericism and assura its existence with of albums as " Flammende Herzen ", cœurs in flames --.
Cluster is réanima in the years quatre-vingt and has over of the success that Harmonia in has never been.
We must the album Live of Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland this is set the aim of maintaining the Krautrock in the contribution German inherent to the contemporary music.
Neu. had déja been déterré to this opportunity as the œuvre the staff of Roedelius.
The revival physical of Harmonia has place in the House of cultures of the world to Berlin.
Subventionné publicly, in the framework of Festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the book of pocket " Krautrock Sampler ".
It is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
In which the whole of the margin of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be put to the respect of the pop music future.
The place left empty by the group will be made by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno is in the Chamber in the middle of sounds strange, " The only real music, you listen the future ".
There of the photographs which show the producers with Harmonia in the part of the firm.
The projections of other pictures in black and white of tools cable in the bazaar used to the training of the myth.
In, the three veterans are of new occupied to improvise.
But more in collant of microphones to the high and to the battery, to draw to the instruments of sounds unbelievable with instruments to effects built themselves.
Aujourd'hui, the electronic music is to the electronic music.
The three in major fignoleurs of technology.
In this same the choir of the house there is change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we tousse and rumors in the cloud of sides, and we like to a nice time " Aaaaaaaah " with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a concept very English.
It not be is never is of rock.
The roots have been less looked in the blues that in the conservatory of music, Can )- in the technology, Kraftwerk -- or in the brain of agreements artistic or social, Cluster --.
Those who shouts " 68 " did not completely wrong, and Harmonia also not be is now more irritated by it now.
But this which is the most of itself will be covered carefully on the scene.
What is the music and which ends it?
It can kick on the edge of someone, ? -- or even give of fugaces time of great joy.
Richard Gere is quite simply not enough cynical.
With " The Hunting Party " and " Peace murderous ", two films deal of new the war of Balkans.
But the two do not do not.
Either the projects are of too on the action and on the exchange of the senseless act is to the contrary they are too larmoyants.
Here, even Richard Gere in " The Hunting Party " not can not help.
The good news of course, all the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely here, in the hinterland the most dismal of the war of Bosnia, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had in the last place lost for the best man of years quatre-vingt, because that much too of the role gentillets and futils in films to feelings for women and much too of conferences of the press on the subject of Buddhism him have pleased the desire of show.
Aujourd'hui Richard Gere is suddenly the most important point to look when even " The Hunting Party ", when the hunter becomes the hunted, why the films of aujourd'hui must they be too long and confusing that of the collective agreements of the drivers of the trains? --
It makes a magnificent representation full of clins of œil: in essence, its figure of delay of the war Simon Hunt is this that Gere could become, if the fate and the industry of the films were not too impatient, a man who has his best time for long behind him, but that, even in the monument in the end to its decline, has however left of remains visible of its former charm.
But despite this asset, " The Hunting Party " has together with the German production " Peace murderous ", which has also this week, the endless continuation of films failures on the war of the Balkans.
In " lethal Peace " we can be quickly the trial, the film is of two German soldiers in Kosovo, Adrian Topol, Mr Riemelt )- who save a Serbian of freelance Kosovo, in which one of two is still quickly lovers.
Although it is welcome that by the action does not be for a time not presented as the only causes of all evils, this film also flat that a téléfilm become much too quickly in the action and the exchange of firing crazy.
It is a kind of " Alarme for Cobra 11 " without highway but with a war to the place.
On the contrary, we can see in the perfect example of " The Hunting Party ", why in fact it there never had a real good film on the war of Balkans.
The history of three particular of the American war, which is necessary to seek the high criminal of war " the fox ", could perhaps become, with another director and another scriptwriter, all two to the time Richard Shepard )- to another time a new " Book Now ".
Because that the stories themselves are a striking: two male will in small team in the forest, to do any thing that the military does not can not be and for the two male, it is a travel in the madness.
One of the reasons of the failure of " The Hunting Party " is that the it is not simply not Simon Hunt be the cynical left with of a cœur, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
Not, the script must give him of addition a romantic adventure with a Bosnian killed by the result.
Then " The Hunting Party " is completely wrong, when the delay, in the area of the last five minutes, by a track process, is to this that NATO, the CIA and all the premium hunters of the world failed in five years: catch the criminal of war and the allow for a fair revenge the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that the we should take the international Court of the Hague of crime against the film.
In this case, the film has a concern human too deep.
It is report that Karadzic and Mladic are still at liberty, and we suspect the American and the French, here they must be extremely of agreement -- of not not lead the game of the way too hard through of agreements political secrets.
But the good intentions and the villain is this fois-ci so similar that a famous poême of record we has to the idea.
He speaks of a mask in the wood of a Asian devil on the table of the work of poête: " Compatissant, I see the put of front gonflées, clearly, as it is fatiguant to be the villain. "
The films such as " The Hunting Party " have exactly of such head tumescentes, but that difference to which point it is fatiguant to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the war of Balkans.
Recently, it has been reported in the newspaper that all the films Hollywood on Iraq were of great flops.
We can add: it there is still never been of good films on the Africa of south.
This who is every time, when the star signed on a source of crisis or on the scope of mines, it in the fate then some thing as " Rangoon " with Patricia Arquette, " Jenseits go Grenzen " with Angelina Jolie or " " Blutdiamanten " with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still just too close in the time.
What that it in is, of decades are always happened before Hollywood can turn a good film on the Holocaust with " The list of constituting ".
Some films have much still mature, those who are aujourd'hui of œuvres traditional on the Vietnam " The Deer Hunter ", " Book Now " or " Full Metal Jackett " does not have in any case been shrouded unanimously to their time as Heads of œuvre.
But perhaps in know we aujourd'hui also just too on the conflicts of the world, that every tragedy is in direct on two screens in the same time to the house,
And it pleased to scénaristes the lack of sensitivity that they have need to tell of good stories.
" It or not not be " or " The dictator " are in fact become as good as because that Lubtisch and Chaplin do not know not yet to which point the Nazi regime were really.
Perhaps that we do not need not to be good one will be of good flims.
We must it be the eyes artistic sarcastic and distancé of the novelist T Norfolk.
When the has asked on the parallel between his historical novel " Dictionnaire of Lemprière " and the war of the Balkans, it has responded, " It is not that in fact that some things do not change never ".
" The big cities are still terribly dangerous, the men are still killed of a facon horrifiante and the war would always in Yugoslavia. "
Von Beust harvest the criticism for the cancellation of like.
The inclusion of the reduction of mayor of with the application of Hamburg for the Olympic Games of been has been in the policy and the economy to the fierce criticism.
We will continue to fight for the Games on board of the water.
But von Beust call to realism in the assessment of opportunities.
The main director of the Chamber of commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday a abandonment as is " bad for the local economy ".
The last time, no other project was made all of the forces of reason in the city that the idea of like.
" Without this objective, the impetus politico-sportif not could be maintained in the same measures ".
Schmidt-Trenz urge the Senate to do not undermine the draft, but to find it a new point of departure to the longer term, " which is as point of departure a different agenda changed ".
The mayor Ole von Beust in was Wednesday to its previous statements, that the ambitions Olympic of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
" It does not is not Hamburg who decides to a candidate the like, but the Federation Germany of the Olympic Sport " said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
It renvoit to the decision expected of the Federation of Sport early December, in the context of the application of Munich for the games of the winter of 2018.
The preference is for us, that, in the period of time that we had planned to 2028 until then, we will not no chance. "
However the dream does not is not once in the past, said von Beust.
The Federation sports of the Hamburg, HSB -- regrets the declarations of Beust.
In that the impression is given that Hamburg is not more put its candidature for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
" It is too early to close an opportunity, in manage the projects already now ", said Wednesday President of HSB Mr Ploß.
A withdrawal of the application is of more in contradiction with the statement of the leader of the Senate to the opportunity of the reception in House plenary of the Federation Council of schools than of sport.
There, von Beust would described the application of Hamburg the Universiades of 2015 as although " not a substitute " for the Olympic Games to Hamburg.
The Federation of schools than the sport had to in the past weeks nominated Hamburg as the city candidate.
The Socialist group of the mayor has said to the Senate of not not have used this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
" The development of Little Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because it has played the card of like and has excluded the construction of housing ", said the delegates of the SPD Carola Veit and Mr Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Little Grasbrook a plan included in the like and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would relying exclusively on the " factor Event ".
The candidature for the Olympic Games of been in 2012 would for its part raised to Hamburg a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg has been however broken against Leipzig.
It does not are not the coffers of Warhols.
He which links the concepts Sweden and cash in wood, think to Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or even if?
In this time, of funds in timber production in Sweden population of the shadows on the list of œuvres of Warhol.
A large part of quatre-vingt 10 Brillo-Boxs of " Type Stockholm " listed there are of contrefaÇons.
After that the Swedish newspaper " Expressen " has put in doubt a few months ago the authenticity of Brillo-Boxs of the year 1968 of Andy Warhol, the research internal the Moderna Museet of Stockholm lead aujourd'hui to a result désenchanteur: the six " Brillo-Boxes ", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten has been present in 1995 the Moderna Museet, are of copies, and that a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of " Type Stockholm ", which are on the international market of the art.
The former history is enchevêtrée, a confusing series of the artistic production and curatoriques.
In 1964, Warhol created to New-York its first " Brillo-Boxes ", of funds in the wood painted, which is based on the design rouge-bleu-blanc of boxes of soap in the powder " Brillo ".
An exhibition of his work in Moderna Museet was in 1968, with the agreement of Warhol, of hundreds of funds Brillo made of card: They do not was not, for the financial reasons -- of Warhol, but had been directly left of the factory of cartonnage Brillo.
It not was not here to œuvres of art, but rather of their models, of samples of exposure.
In the same time, Warhol had well given the authorisation in 1968 of do produce some funds in the wood Brillo in Sweden, who were not of elsewhere not exposed to Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the time speak aujourd'hui of about 15 funds in the wood who at the time would come of law in the history of art and of the auction, in both that Brillo-Boxes original of Andy Wahrol allowed, with the appelation " Type Stockholm ".
Some of them have reached in the sales to auction most of 100 000 dollars.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum Pontus Hultén said, to harm, more late that about 100 banks in the wood had been produced and presented in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol it would then allowed.
In truth, the 105 cases of Hultén have been produced to Malmo in 1990 only, for exposure to St-Pétersbourg.
In this date, Warhol was already penalty for three years.
Mr Byström, Conservative in the head of Moderna Museet, has examined, to the side of six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three others of the private collections suedoises, of which two have been confectionnées to Stockholm in 1968: their signs stratifiés have been to printed and poncés, then it has applied with a bottles of the paint to the white oil.
The texture of copies who are of the year 1990 revealed to the opposite that the painting has been directly applied without ozone of substance on the signs stratifiés, to the aid of a steam of paint, of more it not is not to paint to the oil, but of a acrylique.
" These funds does not have not been allowed by the artist and should be removed from the list official of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol ", would hear the director of Moderna Museet, Mr Nittve: " If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' to New-York not in has not another decision, the Moderna Museet may the six funds in its collection in copies and material of exposure. "
Already in July the Authentication Board has well heard said, that it enquêterait on the " serious allegations " that will be raised in the case of the funds of air in powder.
But since we are halo there of a inéxorable silence.
The rebel soldiers in Manila leave
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers leave, the same who we were restoring in a hotel in Manila, and which had demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo Arroyo.

The insurgency is brisa nearly 24 hours after the refusal of the army of this is join.
Since 1986 it is has already been at least seven attempts of coup against governments elected democratically to the Philippines.

The poker still hardly predictable on Freenet who has for months been part of the consolidation of the German market of telecommunications.
Freenet had to the end of the third quarter 2.9 millions of customers linked by a contract of the mobile telephony and 1.27 millions of customers DSL and subscriptions complete.
