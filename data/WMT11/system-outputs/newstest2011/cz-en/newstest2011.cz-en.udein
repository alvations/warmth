What he should do? ČSSD in Prague knows no Voldemort or a cafe
The new councillor of the capital city of the Social Democrats will have to overcome some linguistic barrier that in Prague Council and the Representation has understanding of their colleagues from the ODS.
A new members of the Board of Social Democrats "tested," as they know the notoriously introduced slang, which was created in the town hall during the past years, when Prague ruled the current coalition partners.
Encoded vocabulary, Prague's political elites have introduced during the previous era occasions, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and trials in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councillor known concepts too does not understand.
At least it says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm in the Prague policy more like a rookie," responded to the test 'kmotrovského "vocabulary councillor for Culture Lukáš Kaucky.
And, though a political veteran, reacted similarly, Councilman Charles Brezina.
On the concept of the "golf hole."
"It is the only expression of those who are, sometimes I use."
"Otherwise slang in general, I do not recognise."
From the vocabulary, whose expressions Aktuálně.cz published in June this year, before the term of the Congress of the ODS, the newspaper chose six examples, mainly those that are notoriously linked with an through Prague.
The Socialists should explain the concepts of "Voldemort," "the greatest golf hole in Prague," "to go to the candy store," "bull," "betrayal of the capital" and "oplechovat."
The trio of councillors with kvízem agreed, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, which has run the show in the future Mácha education - the first conversation has promised later, but did not answer the phone.
The fifth councillor Peter Dolínek straight test refused.
"These things don't care at all, and that talking Civic Democrats, I won't rate."
"I am now, as we understand each other in the context of our programmes," he responded.
As has already been mentioned, councillor Lukáš Kaucky would be in the title of the supposedly could not recognize that there is talk about influential entrepreneurs and friend exprimátora Bém Romano Janouškovi.
"Voldemort" Kauckému he says nothing and only term, which in the test correctly estimated, is "the biggest golf hole in Prague."
"It is the tunnel," says Kaucky, and now adds: "But I know more of the newspapers."
"I'll have to pay for a language course," quips.
Golf swing then as the tunnel administration of decrypting them not only matador Karel Brezina, but also the councillor for the environment Lukáš shy.
Both social democrats then know who is really Voldemort, and Luke Plachému familiar, and that is where this figure to find - a sense of the importance of the term "to go to the candy store."
"I think it means to go to some of the company," it is shy close to a solution that the seat Janouškových firms.
Equally with Březina recalls that knowledge of the 30th of the paper rather than a dictionary used.
In the social democracy under trainees no test similar to a familiar vocabulary slangových expressions does not exist.
"I have even with my colleagues, but it looks like you really have nothing like this."
"We say more names, sometimes use shortcuts and distortions of names," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský which partisans call Hulda.
"Birch told me at school, but I don't know if I say even colleagues," according to his own alias Karel Brezina.
Aktuálně.cz name tested and works.
Councilman Weinert is for Grampa party people or less friendly použitých zastupitel Miroslav Poche, who on each other before the election fraud in the attention of sponsoring parties, has for some colleagues nickname "Igráček."
Nicknames are also the only thing that the social democrats in the internal parlance concede.
Supposedly Hulínský prophetess like to hear, but a recorded and another nickname of this Prague of the President.
"Dr. obuškového law," he recalls that Petr Hulínský received its title JUDr. at the Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture "witches," published a pamphlet
The women declared in Burkině Faso for witches have several common characters.
Rather belongs to the older generation, are unable to participate in the work of health reasons, for example, are free and have no children.
That harridan "becomes" is sent into the isolation, to put the rest of the village.
"The man to suffer this fate very rarely."
"Marginalize the young healthy women, because they help at work and children born," describes the nun in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso old in a special house on more than a hundred women that their community of their ranks vyhostilo.
The local government is now against abnormal "social measures" has decided to take action.
The information published a pamphlet, which should help limit a witch hunt.
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkině Faso can't read," said to the disadvantage of a written education newspaper Die Standard.
The accusations of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which with Burkinou Faso adjacent, last week died dvaasedmdesátiletá Ammy Hemmahová after three women and two men were tortured, they coated with kerosene and set it on fire.
Informed about the case of the BBC.
The perpetrators claim that this was a bad luck.
The woman, in their version of the ignition of oil, which is used to celebrate rites.
He held after a group of women wanted to "expel the evil spirit."
The isolation of the "witches" support people, regardless of the level of education.
Daily newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human souls požíračky always pose a danger," he said.
While in Burkině Faso with a witch hunt trying to temper the government, in the Gambia with him in the last year in the president himself.
"President gambijský Džammí after the death of his aunt unleashed a witch hunt, which they said at the deaths involved, and try to use the black magic to kill, and the President himself."
"The assistance he enlisted witch doctors for help from the near Guinea who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the personal bodyguard of President forcefully out randomly selected men and women from villages gambijských on the president's farm at Kanilai," said in his report by Amnesty International.
At the farm had to the imprisonment of people to drink a potion of herbs with halucinogenními effects, which, moreover, was the bowel and kidney problems.
Two imprisonment of the stay on the farm did not survive.
After the international pressure was, in the end, almost a thousand imprisoned released.
Bakalův tenant: Mired in the stove, the higher rent signed
The stocky man stepped from the door of the client company RPG Apartments "uhlobarona" Zdeňka Bakaly, the largest private owner of rental flats in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm, he carried a folder and in her new lease agreement on three housing: His, his daughter and his son, who is in prison.
All three precisely deregulation up the rent.
Instead of 3500 a month will be the son of the next year to pay for a flat 2 + 1 of the second category of 4100 crowns.
"And that there is no hot water and drown must petrama (stove on solid fuel, Topolánek tried.)," shows a man with a finger in his son's new treaty, whose signature is the full power.
"I signed it," explains half and half mad with resignation.
Civil associations BYTYOKD.CZ that the new lease terms, identified as "unfair and immoral," advises the tenants of new contracts do not sign and wait until December 7, when shall publish guidance on how to proceed against them.
But the man over just waving his hands.
"One says it, the second it," it will be.
Ostrava region is becoming a great laboratory of deregulation.
After the new year is the great majority of the apartments, which have in the Czech Republic has not yet regulated rent.
Aktuálně.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
Waiting room havířovská RPG is one of a total of four in Ostrava and Tuesday at nine in the morning, is already full.
Right next to the door of the cost of security and the security agency in her photo equipment.
"The rent 2011 ', it is a special button on his contact display.
One pats and of machines leaves the paper with a number.
You do not read "157" and your number for making that noise on a big screen under the ceiling of the waiting room.
For half a second, you're next.
On the rent, after a moment comes to ask the elderly couple, the surge in the waiting room, but new rents obviously not at all.
Most people came to solve common problems as another time - repair requests, claims, and so on.
Letters with new contracts are rentals in Ostrava in the mailbox tenants of the majority out of 44 thousand apartments RPG around the portfolio since the middle of November.
RPG Apartments them in letters proposes an increase in the hire on 15 to 38 percent.
Special bulkhead to new nájmům was at the client the centre opened 18 November.
"It runs through the week, so it is only in the run in," the worker behind the counter after a moment's hesitation, when the client will present as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakalovy former mining flats are local incendiary topic.
Before the elections, he loudly enough took Vice President of Parliament and of Ostrava native Lubomir Zaorálek from the Social Democrats, and even now are the local newspapers full of him.
"Twenty years after them, I want to break a new floor."
"Neither pos.. anou record on the toilet I weren't," he relieves úvodou in the man.
So far, most of the workers come pensioners to see if they will get a discount on the rent, if they sign in time, as playing them on special offer promises.
Half a discount on February rent, they will get the other tenants, who will sign a new contract by 15 December.
Havířovská "deregulatory" bulkhead but queries is certainly congested.
"From yesterday's 360 clients here for the hire for 2011 was only about forty or fifty people," estimate worker behind the desk.
RPG yet on the Web and its nástěnkách proposes individual negotiation of contracts where it is needed.
However, if the lease both parties agree, it will have to establish an independent court.
"It is not a threat, but the information on the only possible and absolutely legitimate the legal procedure," draws the RPG on its website.
"There is no one to judge," he thinks one of the workers of RPG Apartments and the man in the street in front of the client center gives her partly for the truth.
"I have a pension and I have five thousand on food, I don't have to judge," he says.
Worker but then just znejistí.
"We'll see."
"Mr Zaorálek them in the media says, whether nepodepisují, so some people are waiting," she says.
The regulation of rents end in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year of 2011 and the RPG Apartments is the increase in the economic necessity.
"The existing rent is still less than the amount needed for a simple maintenance of the housing stock," recalls Paul Klimeš, director of the company after the portfolio of RPG Apartments that aggressive tenant vytýkaná neglect of the housing stock, according to homeowners is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010 could invest in rental flats RPG from four billion, for the four years from 2010 to 2014 that is to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen TV hanging on the ceiling, deeply sedačkám havířovské waiting room yet repeats a few red highlighted of information.
"An increase in rents in 2011 about 15% and less concerns 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of the flats RPG."
"And it will always be the most on the 7.50 CZK per square metre and a month," will be displayed on the screen.
For only 400 apartments from the portfolio of the RPG, the rent rises to 38 percent.
"In such cases, it is the increase of the extremely low amounts 19,66 CZK per square metre," draws the RPG.
At 2600 apartments next year, the rent will remain the same.
RPG Apartments promises that deregulation anticipated rents in spurts, but it will be spread in four to eight years.
In addition, adds a further commitment: All money from the increase in the hire (see chart) will give the company back to the apartments, especially in the heat of savings - new windows and insulation.
Priority is to get the people who will sign an agreement on the increase in the rent.
The staircase includes kindergarten, understand the architects
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new company Arch.Design.
Nobody would have expected that it conceals also Miniškolku with all that that entails - with colored walls, a creative furniture, a bunch of toys, and even a playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it may visit the children of staff Arch.Designu.
If the projection, architectural company Arch.Design, which is the result of a number of significant buildings celebration, calculated with the space for corporate Miniškolku Avriopoint since the first drawings of the building.
Employs nearly 90 people, mainly aged babyboomu and she cared about the fact that women and projektantky an interior design could quickly return to work.
Together with the possibility of shortening jobs is kindergarten reward, which offers Arch.Design their employees in the context of the social agenda.
Stavařky and the architect so they have the ability to combine hard job with the care of the child.
Miniškolku have made workers themselves Arch.Designu and with the support of the leadership they have managed to get the grant of the European Union and of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Corporate miniškolka is financed from the resources of the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human resources and employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant financing (subsidy of 2, 8 million USD) could buy equipment and equipment, and for a period of two years to ensure qualified staff and operation.
After exhaustion of the financial subsidies (2 years) has company Arch.Design duty for a period of 3 years to operate Miniškolku at their own expense.
The preparation of the project lasted for one year, and with applications significantly helped company Economy Rating.
Care provides qualified personnel, on the children to be looked in the care of a nurse and a teacher Nursery School, in kindergarten, then, can walk children without age limits, yet most of them over the age of 3 years.
Because it is about "Miniškolku," may be present at the same time, only 5 of the children during the day, but they will be replaced by even more.
Operation of the kindergarten is flexible, according to the needs of the parents and children of all employees have the same right to make use of the kindergarten, regardless of the position in the company.
Though it is the individual education and care, the program content in miniškolce is comparable with the Framework Programme the primary education.
Children have not only play, but they ensured the quality of teaching - from basic cognition after the preparation of the school, is Professor of the English language.
Class is equipped with not only toys, games podnětnými, but also by the computer, which children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can always check your child and cease the stress to the delay vyzvedáváním children of nurseries remote from the workplace of parents.
The parents so use working time more productively.
It is not surprising that there creates a naturally loyal relationship employee - an employer.
Arch.Design one for Czech companies, which offer significant benefit in the recruitment of new staff, are friendly to the family, and through this programme strengthened staff marketing.
The house of the bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look in the interiors from Gaudí
The roof looks like a spine of a primeval lizard, the staircase recalls the backbone of the dinosaur and balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the house Casa Batlló in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From local a house with their organic shapes dubbed the House of the bones.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stone fragments kachlů and mosaic, facade like scales and pervasive soft curves, all of this is typical of the Art Nouveau Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house making dream line, soft colour and texture reminiscent of nature and animals.
As it is to see geometričnost, rhythm, and exactly the right order.
In the night of the whole facade home sounds even more dramatic is nasvícená so that the impression gloss color potentiated yet.
The winding and twisting forms with the same degree in interiors.
Wood in the waves is copying window frames, railings, decorative elements of the door, Watch and bar.
House Batlló, which is in the district of Eixample on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43, was rearranging the house from 1877 from architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
Reconstruction took place two years, and the house was completed in 1906.
Investor, a rich industrialist, Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old buildings and creating a completely new, soon, however, accepted the Gaudí idea of the unusual and expensive reconstruction assistance.
Apartment house Casa Batlló but Antoni Gaudí did not suggest itself.
He cooperated with him an architect Josep Maria Jujol.
On his plank projektantském incurred decoration for representative apartment of the owner of the property and use of mosaic on the facade.
On the facade worked and many other creators and artists.
The joint work on the proposals of the Casa Batlló launched a successful cooperation with Jujola Gaudím.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaudí house Casa Dear and Park Güell in which are further Gaudí works.
From local house soon after the completion of their organic shapes earned him the nickname "The House of the bones."
Others due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call "zívajícím house."
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword vypodobněn St George, the patron of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motives include and other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí into the house suggested on its time unique system with central heating vents odvětrávacími and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem of their forty five stage pole tendency.
In the formation of Gaudí absolutely ignored the building regulations and keep them to tie.
While at the beginning of the construction of a building permit from the city, but it has the information on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later in the completion was the result of the city council'm horrified and called for a correction.
Mind, for example, the local councillor that the construction of the pillars and into the public intervention on the sidewalk.
To remedy has never occurred, on the contrary: Just fifteen days after the invitation of urban part, Josep Batlló applied (and successfully) received permission to lease of the two top floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower levels.
In the gallery on the second floor was a social salon and on the third floor of the bedroom and private parts of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry.
The whole house šestipatrový cuts the staircase, which will give rise to the roof terrace.
Essential elements of the conversion was the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with both curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with modern concepts of interconnection of space.
The social part can be the opening of the door salonních fully link and the larger society together can easily communicate without at the same time as alert privacy needed for more intimate talks.
Gaudí house with a conversion in addition new facade also unconventional roof and two floors in addition.
Gaudí impressive is also a game of light blue and white glazed tiles, which one's inner courtyard, and skylights.
The game two colors adds maximum of light in all floors of the house.
It was enough simply bet on the principle that white reflects the light more than dark, which absorbs the sun's rays on the contrary.
The house Casa Batlló, which was in 2005 included in the UNESCO World Heritage, anyone can visit.
In the first floor of the house is the most spacious and grandest apartment made available to the public.
Owners have chosen for this step up in 2002, on the occasion of the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the birth of a great artist.
For inspections remained, because they found that this is a very good business and extended tour, moreover, on the common and the attic space, including the roof terrace.
Admission into monuments is certainly not negligible, is EUR 16,50 and students, pensioners, groups, and holders of tourist průkazek have a 20% discount.
Sum is well above the price of the cover charge to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the right atmosphere of the house with dračími steeples, you must be quick friends with some of the inhabitants of the building and to visit him directly at home.
How to choose the mattress and grate: Women have different requirements than men
Not a bed frame, but the quality lehací area, then the mattress and box spring, give the basis of really good bed.
They must, however, harmoniously complement to meet a particular user.
In the selection by a lot of things from the weight, height, age, health, and gender of the owner.
Important is also the type of interior, into which the mattress and box spring are buying.
A typical example?
To be a weekend cottage, where to sink on a regular basis, are not appropriate latex mattresses, because the slower "warm."
In addition, have significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
At the same time, it is necessary to turn it regularly.
If they do not have a lot of odvzdušňovacích canal in the core, and even lying on a slab, intercepted humidity: Could be below them to discover and mold.
In the selection of the decision also a habit.
Who spent a long time abroad, where it is often used a lot of high mattress with změkčující layer, it will be hard to feel good at a low and hard surface.
"I hope all hockey, who were returning from the NHL, I complained that night's sleep."
"In my battered shoulders, and hips needed mattresses with změkčující layer of lazy foam."
"Recommend such, even for people with diabetes, who have the disorder of the nervous system, so badly takes over, information" of joints and skin, "explains Sylva Hadamcziková on upholstered furniture specialises.
Many hokejistům, but other customers because years before the mattress with lazy foam was looking for.
"It's okay, it has to be proper mattress Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also of the Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be the man of the NHL to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" is simply.
Optimizes its stiffness and shape under it had picked up the heat or to adjust to your warm body.
Nothing you press in the night, you will not tumble as a game.
Just better sleep.
Lazy foam also acts as a protection against proleženinami.
In the selection of the size of the mattress with his height add another length of the feet, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of around 180 cm so they need a bed 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be at dvoulůžka 90 cm, a total of 180 cm.
In separate beds, for example singlistů, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For the comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise is the rule for the width of the beds simple: In the camp on the back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the Guild cechmistryně čalouníků and decorators, which is the issue of a healthy sleep and ergonomics furniture pays for a number of years, and he lectures on her professional schools.
U dvoulůžka needs each own grid and mattress, here, however, watch out in the purchase, to reconcile the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, nothing for mounted gratings to different heights, it is you, however, in the case of each bed frame may not succeed.
Foam mattress should have a height of at least 14 cm, types of the brace with spring and finish of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on shaping and hoeing layer.
"In the contact of hand or landing on the mattress springs can certainly feel," warns Helen Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a type of the grid.
Celočalouněná beds, when the mattress and basis are swings like Siamese twins, they do not have to do in the bedrooms.
Mattress wrong větrají, unable to wash their skin, which today is normal.
And for the night because normally vypotíme 0,2 to 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that, after five to seven years, the mattress will begin to remind one big (and clogged) the sieve.
I therefore experts reject the advertising slogans about the life of the mattress to 25 years, or even a lifetime guarantee.
It is, however, but their own.
And that is why the Council of the practice from vendors: The mattress with 120 or 140 cm hygiene and coating snímatelný give up work, but I'd prefer to add the mattress the buffer, which can easily take and wash.
Even though today are normally the mattress covers zdrhovadly around the circumference, so after opening we get two parts (for money, and the size of a washing machine, a lot of important!), yet could manipulation with larger type (and in one man) in reading to remind a slight weight in the ring with a heavy.
You're in bed instead of the grid a solid record?
Never!.
A maximum on the bed for visits for one night.
The plate, however, still lies (if not already) vent holes and use the mattress brace with spring and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from něm.Taschenfederkern) and prepared baking layer.
The PUR mattress on such a basis does not cover.
On nepolohovací laminated gratings with 14 to 18 vanes will be appropriate latex or sandwich mattresses (to be a combination of latex and coconut), but always with you shall pay the gratings with more lamel, 28 and more, where are the vanes in the shoulders bounce, and it is possible to be in their stiffness to regulate.
On pointing laminated gratings does not cover the mattress brace with spring and finish the point because they are not responding.
In addition to setting stiffness lamel you can afford, and the so called shoulder cradle.
It is a special snap lamel, which allows the press, or even a tilt lamelu to shoulder the snorer pretty "stabbed."
For men who have "shoulders across the whole back," certainly important thing.
Even at her remember even manufacturers of mattresses, who in "mens" began to use změkčující zone in the shoulder.
For women also remember - again the indulgence of those softer surface in the hip.
For the most discerning customers are intended křidélkové or platelet gratings with the so called multitorzním '.
Pressure decomposes into more points and reduces the tension.
However, once you use on the right mattress and grate bad pillow (large and "plump"), the majority of the "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: To support your head and a pillow has faced only intervene to shoulder, in order to free the shoulder muscles.
As the appropriate size, it is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which prefer for example in Scandinavia.
In the camp on the side of the pillow should match (with the shoulder the cradle of the grate or změkčenou zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have with the original palliasse plněnými grass something to do.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least the matter.
The trend is just even the mattress bio.
The raw materials from oil, of which are manufactured polyurethane foam, are being replaced with natural oils, for example, from skočce and soya.
Soju just use all known producers.
"Bio for mattress means that the core is made of a material of a purely natural origin," says Petr Vašíček from firms Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are used in the manufacture of the mattress ticking, one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can afford even mikrokapsle to you by the fresh scent of the wood or lavender.
There is a division for men and women.
While the men "cooling" a plant extract from birch to covering the mattress absorbed the heat and cool the body, women on the upholstery "awash."
The extract of red chilli increases blood circulation, so the weaker sex is warmer.
Today's winners?
Mattress made of cold foam (has more pores with a cell structure, is so prodyšnější than normal polyurethane and offers even better elasticitu.
A combination of various tuhostí cold foam and "lazy" foam arise vícezónové mattress that they know exactly where the head, shoulders, and the foot.
So you pay for the quality of the mattress from the seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet health parameters, have a lower rate of VAT, they are taken as medical equipment.
As the first in the Czech Republic on this advantage Gumotex.
Save on a mattress, and the grid is not easy.
Sometimes you can use to be the actions of the producers or retailers who offer two mattress for the price of one.
To be tag Magniflex offers a mattress Duofreeze is being sewn memory foam Memory to the skin for 11 990 crowns.
The second can, of course, already get free of charge.
The era of lazy or of viscoelastic foams with open the cell structure and high density started the "cosmic" pace material Tempur.
Originally as a material for NASA, because in startech astronauts were exposed to an enormous congestion.
Tempur warm softening, out in the cold, on the contrary, has.
The warm human body is so perfectly adapt and dismantles its optimum pressure.
It is therefore ideal against the occurrence of the advantages, but also for an increase in comfort in sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only on the mattress, but also on the medical products, should be on the special pillow under the legs to relieve the feet and žilnímu system.
Domestic producers, for example, use foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and the like.
Instruments for monitoring people want more and more parents, they want to guard their children
Fear of their own child brings more and more people to the idea of surveillance over GPS.
The system was originally meant for the search for cars can, in fact, follow the movement of people, and help to be in such cases, such as the disappearance of old Annie Janatkové.
The device is not yet large like a box of matches, but it may soon be just a big watch.
Many people scared case missing Annie and started the quest for resources, as their children better to protect.
Even at the cost of distortion of their privacy.
"We're trying to say that it is not about spying, but on the other means to reduce the likelihood that it will be a tragedy," says Petr sawdust from society Macro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that, in a particular case, may result in the abuse of such equipment, when they should be in the bag for someone who doesn't know about it, but we have met with such a case."
"The majority it actually customers buy for security reasons," he added sawdust.
According to him, every child should know what purpose "box" is used and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
A child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that, if a child will want to wear anything like this, just with those feelings.
"I very small children show great creativity in how some things on purpose to lose, if they don't want to be under control."
"The great expectations raised before the parents' cell phones, which can turn off, however, as well as the tracking device," says Bočková.
It is even questionable whether, in the case of such a device really helpful.
"In the case of the forthcoming kidnapping, will ensure a criminal always practically that the child had no electronics that could reveal his position."
"It is now the phone."
"When they start to expand monitoring equipment, they will also find them because their sales will surely be supported by a massive advertising."
"In that case, will be the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says psychologist.
It does, however, that a similar device may help in the case of sudden assault pedofilem.
Under Robert Čech from society RC Monitoring, which offers surveillance services for both cars, so for people, even in the event of the assault for the immediate destruction of the surveillance equipment, his presence may help.
"The device can be set on sending regular position after a certain period of time."
"If the damage, it will be available at least the last position of the person concerned."
"More expensive devices have incorporated even náklonometry, so even if he just slipped, and lay still, the device will send a warning immediately with an indication of the location," says Czech.
It may take a similar service and smart mobile phones with navigation, where just load and special software.
The problem of current surveillance units is that this is either on the apparatus similar size přívěskům matchbooks or smaller mobile phones.
Always, there is a risk of their loss.
According to the sawdust of Macro Weil is therefore now test equipment looking like a normal digital watch.
"I will have the greatest advantage in the fact that a potential aggressor may not even recognize the tracking device."
"Or is he after some time, and it can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device shall make into bracelets or pendants, they will still be using the same technology, which is used for the patrol cars.
It is a combination of the positioning through the GPS system (who use the normal autonavigace) and function of a mobile phone, which the current position of the vehicle.
The army has a cord that obmotaly Česko. Last but only two years
Czech Army bought 445 kilometres of lines that are firing explosives.
Last year, at the same time, the Defense Ministry gave to the stores of 224 miles of lines.
So the army has stocks at the 225 years.
The problem is that the durability cord is two, a maximum of four years.
The Army bought detonating cord from stock STV Group Inc. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff in the rationale for the purchase of such a huge amount of cord MF DNES wrote that soldiers in the training consume 60 kilometres of detonating a year.
From the calculations by military mine clearers that MF DNES addressed, however, shows that it would be a very intensive pyrotechnic training annually had to browse through all of the generals, the officers in command of the army, the secretaries or cleaners.
Of Defense Minister Alexander Vondra and the army chief Daniel Picka included.
Only then would be to justify the annual consumption of the army of detonating 60 miles.
This length matches 25 thousand explosions.
And even if it were, the supplies of the army would maintain them for more than ten years.
If, on the other hand, to the basic training for each new professional will do no more than two meters detonating cord, as the experts say, so the army of fresh groceries to ensure - even with increased consumption of Engineers or special units - the supplies at the 225 years.
Soldiers brigades of rapid deployment of the Minister Vondra recently personally complained that they have almost no bullets in small arms, so they are even the shooting because of the need for the money reduced.
The lack of underwear to say nothing.
"I's title does not take that from us are buying repeatedly so large quantities of detonating cord."
"But it is their decision, and I'm sure they know what they will be."
"For us is the army of a good customer who, as traders seek to meet," says the commercial manager Jan Děcký STV Group.
Department of Defense spokesman Jan Pejšek justifies the hundreds of kilometres of purchased cord and the fact that the army will have supplies of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of STV Group, however, is talking only about four years of life safety fuses and police or military bomb techs even just about two years.
"In a perfect storage, it may be those four," says one of them, who, as a soldier for the criticism of the army does not want to disclose the name.
At the end of the life of any ammunition must be carefully tested, whether it is still reliable and does not threaten soldiers in life.
These tests, however, are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry is the quantitative discount on 445 kilometres of cord.
"Cost us about sixty percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred 44 miles," a spokesman for the translator Pejšek the opinion of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defense.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of ejection cord police bomb squad, who destroy munitions from the Second World War, or that after the Soviet army, for a few years, does not exceed 1 500 metres.
And the police orders always just such quantities that this ammunition used up before the end of the life.
She worked for the security of the bomb squad, and it can earn more modern, more flexible, and therefore more reliable type of cord.
The Department of Defense has already a significant problem with the tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from the Warsaw Pact, the Czechoslovak army over 200 000 people has prepared to draw on the Rhine.
Czech here in the bomb squad that MF DNES said, is waiting for a couple of years of the same problem: Will dispose of hundreds of miles of old detonating cord, which is now "cheap" purchases.
Still I gather from the contacts, which I acquired through competition
Winning a place in the competition year Živnostník help Luke Bagman franchises in the sale of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of competition Živnostník year became, a businessman Lukáš Bagman of Liberec.
His story is as a success of the film.
Lukáš Bagman like to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec missing quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
On the savings of foreign brigades and using bank credit bought polorozbořený house with five flats.
The fact that he was still a student of the third year of high school, it was a great courage.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation with us gave me, that I tried to do something," says Lukáš Bagman.
The first reconstructed apartment began to rent to foreign workers.
All profit invested back into the house, which gradually into pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years the business gradually succeeded in Liberec open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurant and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
Experience of them was until recently, four star Bagman design hotel.
This year, but it has other, the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with the hotel in the Island for Tisá, where we sold our franšízingový concept, and other candidates on hotels franšízu Bagman reporting," says the sole trader last year's number one.
"And on the sale of the licence to operate the hotel played a great role that victory in the competition Živnostník year," he adds approvingly Bagman.
The victory brought him greater acquaintance and popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"I studied the people on the streets, often even retrospectively congratulated me, and I have to say that it was nice," he says.
Participation in the competition certainly recommends to all who will pursue something.
Nor is it necessary to win, each visibility is good.
He says that to date draws on contacts and influence, which might not otherwise have.
"With certain, thanks to competition that I met, I began to do business on a regular basis."
Glory associated with success under him was a little bit on each worker.
And that has around 1300.
"I see a greater loyalty and pride, that is involved in something gained general recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it is the result of good work of all of us together."
"My name is vystrčeno to the fore," he says now modestly Lukáš Bagman.
His successors have a calmer year than we had in Farmetu
The euphoria of victory quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thank you sir winner, however, has Farmet worse times in a row.
For the price for the first place in the last year Vodafone Company of the year in the last year, the owner of the house came Slovanském Farmet, Karel Žďárský.
The jury then appreciate the efforts through which built from a small workshop nástrojářské in the Czech Skalice company with stamilionovými turnover.
"I can say that the awards encourage not only me, but all of my collaborators and increase our confidence for the fight with the competition," says today of last year's winner.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet was the desire to do something useful.
So, when the state offered to father Karl Žďárského to rent a little up a little as compensation for the communists seized from the property, a refused to a career in the company, where he worked at the time, and with a couple of friends around his father founded the firm of plastic tubs.
Shortly later began to specialize on presses of vegetable oil.
After 18 years, they became the biggest producer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Greater awareness among the public and further, the company received after the success in the competition through the media.
"Not only of our customers to mark Farmet significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that, working together with the company that has achieved success in their own country," says Charles Žďárský.
The past year, however, was not just a sign in Farmetu in the euphoria vítězsví.
The award was based on the performance of the company until 2008, and only partly from the year 2009.
And the year 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of goods.
During the height of the crisis, which is still so many citizens of the bill, but the company has already halted its investment projects, and began to limit the purchase of new machinery and technology.
"This situation is, of course, even us."
"Revenue fell by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and even on redundancies," explains Charles Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to do even sometimes such unpopular measures.
But the situation under control and keep in profit, even if a smaller than before the crisis.
What, however, in Farmetu neslevili, is the investment in research and development.
"From the subsidies we built the research and the training centre, enhanced presentation at international fairs, received the award in domestic trade fairs," says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again, and with them, the number of new employees.
"The new winners have a nice feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Charles Žďárský.
Poll, which removes the pointless legislation
Poll on Absurditu year is the fourth part of the race.
Some pointless legislation has already managed to break.
Neslavným Absurdita the winner of the next year of the year became the obligation to wear on the documents that officials are also available online.
Decided that more than one third of the more than four thousand voting.
For example, social security administration required a paper statement from the commercial register, even if the official it may obtain two clicks of the mouse.
Thanks to the poll, it will change.
"Czech Social Security Administration already excerpt from the Commercial Register during the checks at national insurance premiums will not be required," said a spokesman for Jan ČSSZ Buraňová.
A light on all legislation and regulation, which has businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic to play, and the break is the spirit of the competition Absurdita year.
That is a part of the race for the fourth time this year already organised Hospodářskými newspapers and among the public are increasingly popular.
If the last year, the vote in about three thousand voting, this year, they were nearly four thousand.
And it is not surprising, of various legal obligations, which only serves to delay the business, it is still with us.
"To be in the number of papers for tax returns, we will be at the top of the world," notes to Karel Havlíček from the Association of the small and medium sized enterprises, and the mass of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the business in recent years becoming an avowed goal of all governments.
In comparison with the world, but in the Czech Republic of the situation is not improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic in terms of conditions for entrepreneurship rated 74 position, it is eight points lower than last year.
Competition Absurdita year, for the first time, in 2006, and each year follows the same script.
Log on administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can anyone every year from April to the end of September, when the deadline is competition.
The logon serves the web address www.firmaroku.cz After the competition organiser selects the seven candidates for "anticenu" and leave it in the course of the October vote on the public via the Internet site www.firmaroku.cz / absurdity and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity, which can get the most votes wins.
In this year's survey was recorded more than a hundred, or 105 legislation and the Regulation lacking sense.
Tips sent entrepreneurs, but also professional associations, and journalists.
Between "finalists" competition, so between the nominated was, for example, the requirement that wagons for the maintenance of motorways and speed roads, pay tolls, or to entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets painted every two years.
The list of this year's seven proposals is made public on the website of the competition.
Publication of competition, which is always the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of hapenningu, which regularly participates in the integrity of the political and social life.
This year, for example, at this climax competition assists Eva Svobodova, director of the Association of the small and medium sized enterprises and businesses of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, President of the Economic Chamber of the Czech Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the State throws entrepreneurs's wheel, so it is my aim to abolish every year, at least three dozen paragraphs, which is now only for business," said the Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The effort to disturb the pointless Regulation nevyznívá empty.
In 2007, most people have an obligation to report three days ahead of the entrepreneur Trade Licensing Office in the place where it is placed in the permanent establishment, the intention to go to the exhibition or Festival.
This obligation was deleted by an amendment out of the law.
The second most hlasovaná duty in 2007, which was the result of an employment office for its foreign staff of the mission in a range of up to 30 days, was removed by the law on the green card.
And the third time lucky.
Absurdity of 2009 happened Regulation fyzioterapeutům have in the office of a large mirror, fridge and two land weight.
It was this year, the decree of the Ministry of Health - mitigated by the obligation to have fallen off the refrigerator.

In this first year of this special subcategory main competition Vodafone Company of 2010 with the reviews of the company, for which it is not the only success in business long term objective.
The story of each of them is a very inspiring and would be in a separate article.
Although the subject of its activities from each other very different, for the common denominator of their efforts can be seen as support and consideration.
In one case concerns, for example, disabled people and elsewhere to be personal problems or the health of its own staff.
Among the 14 finalists celorepublikovými finds itself, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the development of informal sports teams between employees who will then take part in a number of tournaments in different sports.
Another example of responsible companies from the Pardubice's company Isolit-Bravo, which is the main contributor of 17 years the trust sponzorujícího handicapped children.

In category Odpovědná company year were automatically logged on all Vodafone krajští contenders in the competition a year, who answered the questions of a questionnaire appended to the application and sent it by 15 August of the organiser.
Obviously incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then organise excluded from the assessment.
"If representatives of competing companies to the issues, they could not have the competition Odpovědná company of the year to attend, but they are not disqualified from the" main "competition Vodafone Company year."
"A separate login only in this competition is not possible, because it is the main competition for a year," explains Charles Goldman from the Chairperson of the Agency Bison & Rose.
The Fund Pozemkovém in Pilsen police arrested in a public competition
In the building of the Fund BLM in Pilsen in recent days to arrest the anti corruption of the police.
Handcuffs detectives put the local entrepreneurs in the media sphere and businessman with the realty Luboši G.
He reportedly tried to manipulate the current public competition for the settlement of restitution claims to the land offered in the competition has a particular candidate.
He had for Luboši G. to pay half a million crowns.
"I can only confirm that the police prosecuted one person for offense meddling in a public tender and in a public competition," said the boss of the Pilsen Právo PPO Antony Green, with other details with regard to the ongoing investigation could not provide.
Entrepreneurs šestačtyřicetiletého policemen after 24 hours was released on freedom.
The way in which he could affect public competition, can be given a minimum of official information only speculate.
A spokesman for the BLM Fund Lubomír Black on the query Rights said that the workplace odloučeném in Pilsen officers actually arrested, and that during a public competition.
"It was a client, not of our employees," said.
A public competition is under the name of the Black "Invitation to submit tenders of rights to the transfer of land, according to the law of the land" and takes place, in the case of the land offered to show an interest in more qualified applicants.
"These persons in the context of the challenges offer a higher value of their of restitution claims to be settled by the transfer before it was announced, the value of the land."
"As offered entitlements down the order of purchasers and Pozemkový fond (Land Fund) then converts the land to the person who offered the highest claims," said a spokesman for the fund.
Luboš G. had information, who has signed up to the challenge, and since he is also authorised person, since bought a number of of restitution claims, offered candidates on the grounds that the competition will not participate.
For it probably has severance pay.
That would explain that he was in detention as a great deal of money.
Luboš G. had premium contacts on PF in Pilsen in the past.
Was seen in the case of the former boss of the PF Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for the fact that he made in a restitution land, for which he was issued a decision on the location of the buildings.
Just then gained Luboš G. from Fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public communications, namely in a place where she should build arrival thoroughfare into the industrial zone Borská pole.
Later, he is a very good way to a house in the historical centre of the city, which had a much higher value.
Then on that town hall had to agree, because otherwise it would jeopardise the blocking the construction of the land.
Households on housing připlatí hundreds of monthly
The home from January will have to overpay not only for all types of energy, but also for the aqueous and stočné, supply of heat and somewhere to rise and rents.
Family from January will have to pull from the purses of hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
Electricity rates of up to 4.6%, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, only about a tenth of a in some cities will have to overpay for the supply of water, and often also sharp central supply of heat.
A more expensive electricity should come out a year on households in flats stokoruny more than now.
The price of the electricity at the same time, all the main contractors have reduced, at fault, therefore, it is a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable resources, particularly in photovoltaics.
Gas may be slightly more expensive, but in a time when most people are drowning and so have the highest consumption.
A year must therefore also reckon with hundreds of crowns in addition.
While the electricity and gas will push up across the country, a change in the price of the central heating is different place from the place.
Price increases are planning mainly larger community.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kralove pay from January for the central heating about 50 crowns a month, moreover, of the more than 1000 kroner per year will pay the family in Liberec.
The people of Prague, again, there is a risk that they by more than 9 percent of aqueous stočné becomes more expensive and, in the event that the city will increase the rent of the infrastructure.
If the rent will not change, you připlatí Pražené 6.8%.
Price in Prague, however, it will still belong in celorepublikovém comparison between the lower.
In north Bohemia, where already prices are among the highest, has the aqueous and stočné podražit by 7.4 percent.
Significantly, they can, for example, the rise in the price of rent in the 450 thousands of rental flats, where from January ends of regulation.
For example, the company CPI Apartments, which in Usti nad Labem own about 2,500 flats, intends to rent since January to increase by up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new amount of rent, it intends to give the company to court.
Controlled rents paid by the people in approximately 300 thousand apartments, next year could increase by up to 10 percent.
Czech children have boozed fernetem and rum. Beer is out of fashion, with slow
Fernet, rum, vodka, and the exceptionally better brand whisky over her parents.
It's drinks, after the end of drinking most often in the care of doctors drunkards, which has not yet even fifteen years.
Children are not the exception, which is from the monkey treated in hospital repeatedly.
This stems from the experience of doctors who, with similar cases face on revenue of children's department hospitals.
"A beer or wine are totally nemódní, because it takes a long time before he with them."
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," said the chief of the department Právo Hospital Hořovice in central Bohemia Luděk coconut.
"If they can get a bottle of your father of the cabinet, so it is to be the whiskey, but otherwise dominates fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage that it pour into the juice and not so many of them feel," said the chief.
And for the truth gives him, a spokesman for the University Hospital Motol travel.
"It is most frequently fernet or rum."
"It is now the modern alcohol in particular primary school."
"In some cases, on the bad times, which have brought from home," stated Jurinová.
By Karel Pelican Brief two weeks are thirteen or čtrnáctiletí drinkers in hospital income relatively commonplace.
Before Hořovicemi, where they operate from this year, he worked for ten years just in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances ferrying podroušené students from a wide area.
"One girl for us lay about four times."
"Career launched in 12 years, when it came to us with 3.5 per mille of alcohol in the blood, in addition, in combination with the ecstasy," described a particularly serious case.
"It was in the exhibition in Holešovice on some dance party."
"Interestingly, that her mother was odd that his daughter 48 hours didn't know," said the chief.
Just lack of parents, or even their considerable tolerance to my own offspring is considered to be the main cause of the growing child pijanství.
The addiction in the true sense, however, according to the experts in children to speak.
"The term an alcoholic means a chronic dependence on alcohol with all phenomena that belong to it, and it is not for children."
"Those alcohol use repeatedly, it is more of a family and social background," explained chief of coconut.
According to a spokesman Jurinové this year on the pediatric clinic in Motol was committed by the middle of November, about forty drunken children.
In the statistics, however, they will receive only those with a heavy intoxikací, which had to stay in the hospital.
Child drunkards, which would take out the treatment for parents, or a home will be taken by the police, are not counted.
Unless children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of whisky, there are three seasonal fluctuations in the Pelican Brief two weeks, on which we can rely on: The witch, the New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year.
"Either celebrating grief from the bad report card, or, on the contrary, they are celebrating the beginning of the summer."
"I have, of course, to the witch on income and seven child of drunks at the same time," said Brown.
A drunk, which spends a night detoxikací under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, is at an advantage compared to the fact that the next day at home suffer an unpleasant hangover.
The morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, and irrigation with infusion with glucose and nutrients that organism is missing.
"They are actually better, because they have after this beautiful evening experience and good awakening and nothing is not hurt."
"Only they're confused of that, where they are," he admitted with coconut, sometimes blow patients a pleasant mood, at least by the costs of their treatment required.
The ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed, works even in the tens of thousands of crowns.
"I use it as an educational tool, if I'm right then those children on rounds he said, how much their drunkenness stood, and it could also spend the whole summer on the brigade to make money on the one party," added Brown.
However, the health insurance companies under him to regresním management, in which the parents would enforce the cost of treatment, in cases of child of drunks proceed.
The two L - 159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
The two L - 159 of the total five pieces for which Czech Defense Ministry Sub-committee transport plane Casa C 295M, on Tuesday, it was flung into the Spanish Mediterranean, where aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS.
This is the first time that the machines of this type occurred in the property of someone else than the Czech army.
In a foreign country has only been in exercises or presentation years.
It is a version of the two seats L - 159T1, which has been engaged in the Czech army, and that were available.
The other three machines are single L.
While you stand in zakonzervované Aeru Vodochody and the provider of trade - company Omnipol - it has already taken over the last week.
When aircraft physically of huntin Vodochod, not by Jana Pejška from the Department of Defense not yet known.
"L single aircraft in 159 have been earmarked for the shift from a long term of the aircraft, and that without further deposits and investment on the part of the Ministry of the Ministry."
"L - 159T1 two seats were exchanged in the current state and form," he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the military without the two-digit aircraft will not remain, because the Ministry in May 2009 has signed with Aerem Vodochody contract worth 200 million crowns for converting the four unneeded machinery L - 159 two seats on two machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will take until the end of this year.
According to the EADS Pejška committed aircraft take into the armory of some alliance of the country.
"In the contract is clearly stated that the buyer of aeroplanes L - 159 is company EADS, and they will be used to train pilots of the NATO countries."
"It is a thing of the customer, the way this thing will be implemented," stated Pejšek.
Reuters recently indicated that, such as the Spanish army on the L - 159 not interested.
The exchange of five L - 159 behind one of the Casa and the purchase of a further three aeroplanes for 3.5 billion crowns last year was approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Department of Defense nevypsalo for the purchase of the selection procedure and to address directly EADS.
The former leadership of the defense argued that shift will encourage future exports of L - 159 abroad.
Czech Army from art director bought 72 machinery and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of aircraft Casa is likely to have even the sequel.
The European Commission, the Czech Defense Ministry has sued in the European court because the aircraft should select on the basis of European tender, and not by saying one producer.
The army has already taken over three aeroplanes Casa, the last on the Prague airport Kbely should arrive within a fortnight.
Longer than the index finger ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the index finger longer than the ring finger, are exposed to less risk of cancers of the prostate.
It is a startling conclusion of the study, which published in the middle of the British magazine of cancer.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger may serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for the man in 60 years," said Ros Eelesová theartificial studies, Professor of the Institute for cancer research at the University of Warwick.
Finger could help determine who the men should undergo a test for prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risk threatening or other factors, such as a family health burden, she added Eelesová.
In the period from 1994 to 2009 followed with colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, and in parallel over three thousands of healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger on his right hand is shorter than ring finger.
Paid for the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those whose fingers are just as long.
In the case of those who had a longer than the index finger ring finger, however, this risk has fallen by 33 percent, for the man in the 60s, the decline in even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two aforementioned fingerprints - oppressively in prenatal period - probably reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which the child is exposed in the womb.
Longer less testosterone corresponds to the index finger.
Early studies have shown that testosterone supports the growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav for PŘEDVÁDĚCÍCH CBW said that a study of this quick knows, but it does not seem to him, he said, that the relationship between the length of finger and cancer was "totally proven."

American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American military deployed in Afghanistan, a new "smart" weapon, known only, under the XM of 25.
Generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban, and "change the game" in their favour.
The new weapon is something like a small superpřesné cannon.
Her projectiles the laser's guiding to within a few feet.
Special balls 25 mm, developed for this gun and containing highly explosive explosives, in fact, function as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed, so that not only will explode on impact on the target, but at any point of its ballistic trajectory.
Then they can be used against an enemy, which lies behind some obstacle, behind a wall or in the trench.
Top is usually protected is not, and it can handle the deadly rain of shrapnel, it can be withdrawn from the fight.
According to Richard Audetta, who was involved in the development of the XM 25, is the new rifle first weapon for the infantry, which uses "smart" technology.
"A soldier with her, in principle, be treated so that target, it will send a laser beam, which will be determined by the distance, you will receive your Advanced deliberate point, he edits bearing and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say that you, they measured 543 yards."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun was fired and fire the missile at a distance of 543 yards plus or minus one, two or three feet," Audette.
The 400 jobs transfer
Concern Fujitsu would pass its branch of Bad Homburgu to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July of next year from the administrative buildings on Marienbader-square in Bad Homburgu to Astro Park.
Japanese conglomerate Fujitsu would pass its branch of Bad Homburgu to Frankfurt.
How Wednesday told the giant in the industry, which specializes in computers and their maintenance, moves in July next year, 400 men and women in their place of work from the administrative buildings on Marienbader-square in Bad Homburgu in Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex at the Lyon Street, in the part of the Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the spokesman for the Fujistu it should be in the foreseeable future to move for another 100 jobs group, which are broken down in the region.
Offer lease was supposedly a very attractive and spacious offices in Astro Park supposedly more meet the working of the way of the staff.
Also in bad Homburgu Fujitsu was only in the hire.
The competent manager Bernd Wagner said, "in Frankfurt - Niederrad we found the central office with excellent infrastructure."
Excellent connection with the airport is just for a global society as Fujitsu is very important.
The recent removal of an important business in the region has raised yesterday delighted with the winner and disappointment at the losers.
Leading economic officer in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU), said that this was able to win a "global player."
It is said to be "a fantastic vote of confidence in this site."
Fujitsu was suitable for the city, the build is an important impetus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburgu mayor, Michael Korwisi (Greens), Fujitsu regretted the decision.
The city was supposedly informed in good time the leadership of the company of his intention.
"We are, of course, the company offered our assistance," he said Korwisi.
Friendly contacts but could not change the problem computer maker with the landlord of real estate on Marienbader-square.
In the result was a decisive economic reasons.
Now, in order to avoid a long neobsazení on such a prominent place.
"I hope that it will be the owner of the building and the lessor cooperative."
The house of the Rathaus-square, which has so far made use of Fujitsu, and a neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were ten years ago, together with the other buildings on the National park Bohemian Switzerland Marienbader-square building intentions of the spa town.
Between the railway station and the town hall was created as a joint project of the city and the private designer called urban ENTREE, which has been criticised because of the massive construction areas that had served as the parking lot, and, at the same time, also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001, the home moved in the company of the investment advice and rating Feri, the manufacturer of the software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer maker Fujitsu, which was then still in contact with the company Siemens.
The building, which used Fujitsu, received in 2006 together Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien ‐ Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and, after the year were sold the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-concern from Tokyo becomes the third largest IT provider in the world.
Offers the example of computer companies and sites available and old is also about the service.
Branch in the area of the Rhine and Mohanu is one of the largest in Germany, most of the staff of the Fujitsu is but in Munich.
From Bad Homburgu go to Frankfurt - Niederrad subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, another subsidiary in this area will be Fujitsu Services and TDs company with the name.
In the administrative building Astro Park pronajalo for this purpose, 7,000 square meters.
In the complex - his name draws attention to the star the ground plan, which is 20 years old, is located among other also central union of the Electronics and electronic industries.
Amazon off the server - threats against Assangemu
WikiLeaks is getting into close.
Internet Service Amazon turned off their servers a platform for the detection.
It is possible that this has happened to the political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic traps.
WikiLeaks founder Assange supposedly staying in the United Kingdom.
WikiLeaks, the platform for the detection, is in the United States under increasing pressure.
Internet activists lost access to their old home site in America and now they're looking for an internet home in Europe.
In the meantime, call on a prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the list of wanted Interpol, is to delay by one newspaper of the contribution in the United Kingdom.
"WikiLeaks is no longer on the Amazon."
"Free speech in the land of the free," activists have told the publication of reports by the short Twitter Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before withdrew Internet company Amazon documents WikiLeaks from their sites.
Online activists used for the publication of the secret diplomatic traps Amazon Web Services (AWS), so that they can cope with the large number of access to the documents.
Using the service, Twitter said Wikileaks to this step: "Good - now we spend our dollars by zaměstnáme people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, "and then they should stop to sell books."
Amazon stopped the use of their sites for Wikileaks after they say collaborators of Senator Joe Lieberman made the search, published a CNN, on the basis of the information office of Lieberman.
The President of the Senate Committee for the defense threatened to boycott the home of Amazon, informed the British "Guardian."
"I would have wished that the Amazon came to this step before, given the early publication of classified information on the Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman, meanwhile, has invited to join in the other countries to prevent the platform in the use of the sites.
"WikiLeaks is acting illegally, impossibly and ruthlessly, and it is our national security exposed to danger and threatens the life on the planet," said in a statement nestranického senator.
"No responsible company - either American or foreign - should not WikiLeaks to assist in their efforts to disseminate stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange, which is the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the list of wanted Interpol.
On the basis of the report in the London newspaper "The Independent" remains 39 years old Australian in the United Kingdom, Scotland Yard says he knows even the exact location.
Internet activist always marked the investigation in Sweden for the intrigue of their opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London, he said that there have been threats.
"Were even calls on the assassination of the Julian Assange."
Therefore, the law of Assange fears for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, it will be the founder of Wikileaks continue to hide.
Hrafnsson reacted on the statements from the North America.
In America asked for the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, that the responsible person for the publication of the Wikileaks accused of treason and executed.
In Canada said on TV one aide of the head of the government of Stephen Harper - perhaps ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama might use "target aircraft."
In the meantime, between the White House and the Assange verbal shootout.
A spokesman for US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it a "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange asked for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, where he is responsible for the recent espionage challenges of the diplomats.
"I am not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with the website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy, and the interests of the country are much more significant than his Web site."
The US government is now extensively examining the safety of their databanek.
Special agent, he was appointed Deputy Director of the Centre for on measures, Russell Travers, told the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of the "necessary reforms in the structure," which are necessary after the publication of the messages from the embassy on the Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine ways, as the entire government exchanges and protects the information.
The American government also announced that it wants to look after the safety of dissidents and activists, if they should get into danger because of the publication of the Wikileaks.
"We have taken everything, to get in contact with them," said a spokesman for the State Department Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them, if it was necessary."
Ice cream University
On "Gelato University in Bologna are preparing zmrzlinoví shepherd did to a better season.
On the basic course for your future, which takes three days, it is a great interest, and the visitors coming from all over the world.
Where, in fact, the ice cream?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, Czech a bit of obsolete zmrzlinář, produces the cream by all the rules of Italian zmrzlinářského art.
She gives Gelataio stěrkou ice cream from a cold room, her sister into waffles and sells.
To find out, you don't have to ride into Anzola dell Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to learn more about the ice cream, he will not shirk "Gelato-University" of the Italian companies the Carpigiani.
In 2003 set up an ice cream producer of ice cream machines university to ice cream from his machinery match everywhere Italian high ideals.
The basic course for future gelatieri, which takes three days, it is a huge interest and the visitors coming from all over the world.
But there is also a true special courses of chocolate ice cream and practice in its own zmrzlinárně.
If anyone wants in their Midlife Crisis after the new career, others weigh on thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 people from 19 countries, all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, she loves movement in Slow Food and would like to offer a good quality in the future European product in a country where industrial Ice Cream.
Anke from Berlin's corporate consultant and would like after the years spent stressful work to start something of his own.
Two young to take dreams of in open Kairu zmrzlinárnu.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil, they want to improve the quality of the ice cream in its bars - and a Canadian woman in the household Julia came, because her children love the Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first participants will explain the ideal property perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only a good taste, but also of the silk softness and good consistency.
Luciano forget during his training in Southern and patriotic final icing on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and that includes a still were of romance."
The first step of the production appears to be relatively simple.
Luciano inserts a basic ingredient of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar, and the stabilisers to a big mixer, which all warm electronic programme to 85 degrees and then cool on four degrees.
Then turns on a machine and the faucet over the white pasterizovaný basic cream, the basis of selection of all types of milk.
Immediately is Associate Professor filled with questions: It is possible to make an ice cream only from natural substances without stabilizer?
How can a man alone experiment?
Luciano warns to be carried away by the spirit of the time into the unknown.
Who is talking about the ice cream "only of the natural ingredients," probably as used stabilisers - the majority of the natural product like Guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make an ice cream without stabilisers, but sell in one day, otherwise the strike and a customer of her same ice grains.
Certain variations of basic matter are permissible.
It will be of that past became more tense with aromatic essences.
Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream under additives to buy in a supermarket in either department with fruit or sweets in the department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers trying to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients."
"You should but simply experiment."
With either fruit sorbety with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from the basic white matter, which will change the ova on yellow cream and cocoa on the basis for the country chocolate temptation.
Now may be participating in the rate of an ice cream machines.
Luciano is always to make four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and ice cream lískooříškové eggs - either with or without them in the mass, with more or less with flavouring properties or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment shall be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purée - given the taste it is not always better.
Lískooříšková ice cream may not taste more oříšková, if it contains more of hazelnut.
Most popular ice cream of kiwifruit produced group, which uses the more fruit, less water and a little less of a stabilizer.
Only when balanced combination of going right taste Gelato, says Luciano.
Production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: The peach purée with a lot of sugar, it must be to reduce the share of sugar in the basic recipe.
The lemon ice cream is the need for an extra helping of sugar.
Luciano pulls the instrument, which specifies the sugar content in fruit (measured by the winemakers must from grapes).
Tables, fortunately, reduces the numbers.
Production of ice cream already does not require physical effort as much as before.
Only the instrument does not help for automatic production of basic matter.
There is also, at the same time, a combination of an ice cream umíchá into the cream and cool on minus temperature.
Despite all automation with the inevitable little accidents.
Brazilan Gustavo dirty himself and his colleagues from the top down fruit purée, when he gets out of control of a giant blender.
"At any rate," considers Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before this happens."
Examiners in the light of double
The European Food Authority EFSA is intertwined with the industry, which has experimented with genetic plants.
This accusation now expressed a group of experts Testbiotech, which is considered to be an independent institute for an estimate of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented by," he said on Wednesday in Munich boss Christoph Testbiotechu Then.
Head of the group of experts to the EFSA gentechnicky modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other expert of EFSA have already several years of the contract with the union from lobbyists Ilsi.
That is financed concerns like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper contributed decisively to the supervisory regulations of EFSA for genetic plants and is so in clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
EFSA legislation they agree in whole paragraphs with documents Ilsi and bear as ink industry, which should be controlled by the Authority in Parma.
This is already the second time Testbiotech draws to a conflict of interest.
Recently crossed high manager of the EFSA without additions or transitional period the Swiss concern agrárnímu Syngenta - and this has changed the party.
Also the radio for the middle of Germany (MDR) recently revealed staff link EU office for the control of industrial lobbies, which raised interest as the Ministry for the Environment and the members of the EU.
EFSA, meanwhile, cannot detect a conflict of interest.
Works with all seriousness of data, thus also those of the industry, where they are highly technical quality, is set out in a statement.
From the experts who work for the EFSA, are not required to have contacts with the industry.
But it must demonstrate.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
Itself becomes neutral forum of experts of science, industry and policy - in addition to estimate of the risk of biotechnology without contract lobbyists.
Independent experts like Then criticise that are currently permissible gentechnicky modified plants for animals without any attempt to feed, and that the genetic testing the response of the plant on environmental influences.
"We want to know what, for example, will do gentechnicky modified maize in the field," said Then.
The current practice is only test isolated proteins, and not the entire genetic plant, which they can demonstrate reliable results.
"If they're not looking for risk, as it was then possible to find them?," he asks and Then.
Agrees Angelika Hilbeck.
Scientific worker examines gentechniku since 1994 and is currently working on the technical college in Zurich.
In this area is trying to the industry, as well as in the US, now also in Europe increasingly affect or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore already almost there are scientists who are not connected with the concerns.
Majority, they don't publish studies, which are critical for the company.
"Industry controls the security research," considers Hilbeck.
Trail of stones
Uli Gsell also some issued, a total of about 400 kilograms.
Monday night he stood in front of the station in Stuttgart, the tube on his back.
The demonstration.
Snow it.
The story is known: In September arrived dredges and began to tear at a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart has not been the same: Thousands marched against s21, miliardovému reduction in the station.
If a halt, she was most of the wings in ruins.
Broken on 6000, 7000 pieces.
Limestone from Crailsheim, soft rough stone which was used in the years to 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years.
Ensure a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"Must not disappear."
Dissolve: "Cheap and poor stone, simple and primordial."
One cut, after the smell of cigarette smoke.
What with those pieces will do, yet.
Stones have the time.
Uli Gsell also.
Track stones from Stuttgart leads into the woods at Tübingen in the former deponii munitions of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
44 years old man traded with the old stones.
He bought all that emerged during the cutting in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if, rozemlely on gravel or disappeared on deponii," he says in his office, a wooden box, which was previously the guard house.
Says he swore and threatening him, as in September in all the papers said that he bought the remains of the north wing of the company, which carries out the demolition.
But he was for days with opponents in 21.
And he explained that for the demolition at all cannot.
And if it's wrong, then it is reasonable, when the stones on exercise.
Then he took about 200 S 21 - opponents each one about 80 kilograms heavy block, the price of a piece of 6.50 to 14 of the euro.
As a memory, some also in the hope that it will be back in the construction.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes, cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest of the long ago sold.
Gardeners krajinní gardeners, builders of the home.
They came from all corners of the splat, what fits in the trunk and on a trailer.
The stones of a dispute of Stuttgart is a long time into "walls" or as a border, with herbs.
This stone is not, in fact, nothing special, "says Rongen.
"If it was not the political inserts."
He's getting into my field cars, and going for a ride after its 20 UK yield per hectare.
He studied first law, the study said, later biology, then the computer, and, in the end, he became a trader with stones.
And a lover.
He has saved 40000 tonnes of stone.
Tie their treasures from the whole of Germany.
He says that it is the largest trader of old stones in the Republic.
Hamper..
In the snow lies artistically squared sandstone.
"Once belonged to Marien-bridge in Dresden," she says.
Sandman of the Elbe, yellow, gay, is happy.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on the way up through the forest.
Shows a pile: The red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And on.
"Nice travertine better."
Once belonged to the blocks on the grandstand Neckarstadionu in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertine, from the police by the Presidium in Stuttgart, red granite of the temple of the Sankt Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronnu.
What work, the effort, the sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the hand before 1860 stones and carried through simple kladkostrojů and bull carriages, it will become completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like that it crushed."
I became rich, very rich, not at all.
A businessman with stones but today employs 14 people, and in addition, the seated stonemasons up in the forest, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener.
"We are working hard, but it is satisfying," says the guy who appreciates some leftovers.
In the foreseeable future, it must in Cologne.
Also there will be to rescue the stones.
The fight of talent on high and potentials
The food is a lot of people.
16 students are pushing for the sandwiches with salmon, tomato soup and candy.
Technical University in Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students of engineering and design at the workshop.
Together with the developers of VW here to talk about the car of the future - and by the way to meet Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to the smartest in the race, as well as the company, to succeed and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible to recruit in the lecture theatre are the most gifted graduates, even before they get to the labour market, and they will be interested others.
Because the universities are not issued no lists of success of their students, the company is trying to appear an exceptional talent in projects oriented to practice and to get it.
At the TU Braunschweig is trying to motor concern to get the talent the next day.
A young lady from the personnel department gives pens, jellybeans and plates with the logo of the VW.
It tells budding young talent on the programmes on practice, student occupations and suggests their way into the group.
Nico Selle of TU Braunschweig cares about the project together with VW.
See the benefits for both sides: "Students get into contact with industry, and they gain experience."
"VW may at the same time to meet students, closer to meet interesting candidates and think about you, such as a partner."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, are not unusual.
But the news is that is so openly fighting for the students.
"Otherwise, was rather a substantial professional project," says Selle.
Fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer withdraw their employees of the long legions of candidates.
On the contrary, it must be to try and try to lure particularly highly skilled workforce.
Graduates from engineering disciplines have excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German engineers VDI remained in October will remain unfilled 40,000 engineering positions.
And to VDI the so called a lack of engineers will only increase.
For the audit and consulting firm KPMG is Roman Dykta hunting of talent.
It organises difficult recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, the nature of the modern factory on the treasure, in which they must find a way to coordinate thing GPS.
Next year, the company plans to send as follows eight promising students after the US.
Participants may also review branches of KPMG and to meet with the company.
In advance to decide in two selection rounds, who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème of many candidates will fly to the US.
In a duel on High Potentials in universities will apply under Dykty still tougher laws.
"We want to be with our Race differ from the other."
A simple trip on a sailboat was for us too little. "
It seems that a talent agent Dykta is lucky.
"We remained in contact with all participants in a similar action in the past year."
"Some will soon end the study, and we are planning to apply for a job," he says.
In addition to the direct rapport on campus, especially small and medium sized firms feature standard on labour markets.
"We are trying to contact graduates on professional exhibitions."
"Such as on the Intersolar," states Sitha Stübe, the HR department Solarworld the manufacturer of solar technology.
The company from Bonn employs in Germany around 1500 employees.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
Currently, it is listed 35 positions on the website of the company.
"At the present time, it's just difficult to fill vacancies."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
The other option is the contact through professors at universities.
SolarWorld cooperates with various universities, such as the university in Freibergu.
"Professors shall inform that it is possible to do the practice or write thesis work."
Solar specialist does no expensive advertising action.
Instead, the company is trying to attract other advantages: Personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"Big concerns that often cannot offer," says the head of personal department Stübe.
In the search for a job for a long time to play the main role of the money.
Flexible working hours, custody of children or good options of the procedure are other relevant factors.
SolarWorld occupied in one study of the Great Place that Work 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
Institute compiles the annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks aides, as they are happy with his work and working environment and monitor the framework conditions of employees.
Leading personal department Stübe hopes that the location will bring her points for candidates for the job.
"I think that the candidates will inform especially on external assessments of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy counsels companies that want to build a long term strategy of a good reputation as an employer.
Advise their customers to be more autentičtí.
And, according to Mr Krieglera it means, above all internal measures.
"The best way to raise the profile as an attractive employer is through its own staff," he says.
Technically it is called internal Employer Branding, the enforcement of the employer's share of the market in the context of its own staff.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors."
When the company good care of their people and they identify with the company, they will be from yourself to advertise my employer among friends and acquaintances.
"It is like a game with a string," said Kriegler.
Obama stops the new oil drilling
During the coming years will not be made before the coast of the US and the Federal State Florida in the Gulf of Mexico of the new oil drilling.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and thereby abolishing definitively earlier plans.
Also before the Atlantic coast are so far the new drilling.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar's said on Wednesday.
The reason for a strict ban, which should pay for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the drilling tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before this accident that took eleven employees of life and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signaled to the pressure from the opposition, and its willingness to industry, to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters by trying to reduce the dependence of the US on the supply of oil from abroad.
To date, is not clearly explained, who bears responsibility for a devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The centre of criticism is the British energy group BP, who is confronted miliardovými applications.
The inquiry commission, which was Obama, should provide the results during December.
In October, was cancelled by the Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar ban drilling, who paid from the explosion.
Subsequently submitted the various petroleum concerns applications for new drilling plans.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster of stricter controls and strict security provisions.
Currently, fundamentally reforming the surveillance authority, which attracted attention of many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama has announced that the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for the oil and gas concerns.
The industry is now openly warned that stricter regulations fundamentally reduces the amount of oil produced in the Gulf.
"The government's plans are the biggest impediment to the growth of the gas and oil industry," is the result of the survey in the advisory firm BDO - before the ban on drilling in the middle.
American Energy Alliance, it complains about the uncertainty in the field: "Nobody knows exactly what the regulation will change."
Investments in new mining projects until the appeal put - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni burned
The water in rivers is olejově brown, it smells like a gas station: A billion litres of crude oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni in Nigeria.
People are alive stealing, corruption and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari that means well.
"Don't worry," the journalist's green activist: "Now, you can get in front of the lens was enough oil mud."
37 years old Nigeriánec followed an attempt to take a picture of the boy, who was also the breasts with water, which surround smudges: The scene is active in the water with the gleam formed almost nice.
That, beneath the surface of swimming brown precipitate of oil, is not to see.
Here previously collected into containers enough garnel, says Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty.
In the meantime, has become slowly resulting water completely dead.
Five years ago spilled into huge warm area of broken the leadership of a large quantity of oil.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must row at least six hours to get to the water, where they are the fish: The Ogoni, which is located in the heart of the Niger Delta is one of the most severely contaminated areas in the world.
On the way up the river mangrovníkovými marshes with a lot of lateral tributaries is only detectable the entire range of the trigger.
The engine of the boat is cooking instead of light water brown mess and who sinks his hand in the water, the oil out fingers.
Roots mangrovníků tower from the country like black liquorice pipes, rarely occurring palms are letting their leaves hanging sadly.
We are looking for in vain flocks of birds, which are commonly found in damp areas: Once the engine dies down at the boat, after the former Eden, where it smells like a gas station, the eerie silence.
"What is going on here, it is the environmental leadership of the war," he says sadly Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health."
Comparison with the war is justified.
Ogoni region of the population is the field of battle, where he is fighting for several decades: More than 60 years ago, here come first conquerors of Europe here in the 1980s, formed the first resistance with later executed a writer if Ken Saro Wiwa, here had to concern Shell in 1993 to stop their production, because it was too dangerous for the staff.
To this day, the company must not return to the area of the Ogoni: While a day benefit from the whole area of the delta about triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 in extraction wells and 7,000 miles of leadership more than two million barrels of the black gold, oil fields in the area lie fallow Ogoni, for the concern is the situation is too unstable.
Every few hundred metres out of the water of the steel structure as grotesque statues: "Christmas trees," so too gently called head of drilling holes.
They are 50 years old, the majority to the rusty.
Each time he breaks such title stability of the hole, it tells Akpobari, and then runs a constant stream of oil in the water.
According to estimates by experts cost to the ecosystem in the delta for more than two billion litres for 50 years: Each year the amount of oil, which leaked out into the sea in the crash in Alaska's super tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest disasters of the environment in the history of mankind.
There have been disputes, who is for longer lasting ecological disaster responsible.
While Shell, the group indicates sabotage and organised theft of oil for more than 90 percent of the pollution, speaks protectionists of the environment on heads bursting wells and netěsných lines as the main cause.
Shell in Nigeria requires a much smaller safety regulations than it is in the world, the group charged in 2008 US American scientist Richard Steiner: Only the quantity of the disorder at the lines is "several times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance as a deserted oil grime workshop in the open air, could emerge from mangrovníků figures: They are completely naked and sick from oil.
Under one of many barrels, which are partly linked the leadership, partly arbitrarily, scattered across the country, fire fire: Illegal small refiners.
Oil is in a barrel over the fire is heating a few hours, says Michael, the head of the group.
Over the first moment of leadership in the pot gasoline, later dripping at the end of the leadership of the kerosene and, at the end of the oil.
In this way makes Michael and his four associates a day to four barrels after 300 litres: "Earn so 34.000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the Delta are using a chronic shortage of fuel oil in the state of black Africa.
Nigeria own only one refinery.
A ridiculously low price of 40 cents per litre of diesel, the euro may still top illegal producers: Because they have the raw material for free.
Comes from "bunkerů" who are all part of the leadership in the field of the Ogoni: According to the experts, in the region of the Niger Delta is losing the country on a daily basis, at least 16 million gallons of oil.
But only negligibly small part of the raw material is temporarily stored illegally zušlechtí: Filled with the largest share of organised criminal networks, which are to include politicians and senior officials of the army, in tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate whether the disaster caused the inhabitants and their interventions or lax way of production, E.T.A. Akpobari for purely academic.
"If they did not feel the oil companies for the intruder and if so completely destroy the essence of the fishermen, then was not sabotage or theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, it is the relationship of the Ogoni but, above all, for the Shell so damaged, that it seems to consider only the departure of the group: "Perhaps prove other nations as the Chinese like better."
Michael unsettles.
"High time to disappear," says the producer.
"Every moment can come to the soldiers."
If it is found the special military unit, so while them in prison, but a painful bribe.
Also soldiers, who usually comes from the north of the country - like all Nigeriánci - they want to profit from the raw material.
"This damn thing got our ground in all respects to the bottom," says Akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous building error in engines A380
A380 is obviously a major security flaw.
Investigators have found in the inspection of the machines to make an emergency landing, the possible construction error, which could lead to a "catastrophic failure of engine."
Airline Qantas wants to sue the manufacturer of the engines.

The hell, warriors!
Suits the horror for the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to overcome again the old border with its battle epic "Walhalla Rising."
What the audience thought about the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, when he "Walhalla Rising"?
Captured a Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free from their torturers and in great kills with almost supernatural powers of their opponents - it sounds ideal for young men's viewers who are looking for the bloody action, because our hero helps ruthless methods of killing and their enemies would rend even the insides out alive, if he's in a bad mood.
On the other side of the forward, as it is, in fact, called, during the whole of the film says a word and I till the other figures at most one or two sentences or would tear down to painful dying screams.
Otherwise, are silent and carousing in a horribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the background to the world of the Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is an ideal rather adult movie enthusiasts with interest and very quiet about existencializmus footage of the camera.
It is a good thing, if it has a film more target groups, it is just a pity as mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, after he made a wild and stylizovanou trilogy of drug dealers "Pusher," it is considered to be the version of the Danish director Quentin Tarantino movie, stoically, but prevent that his work near either more humor mainstream or less brutality art the audience.
The majority of supporters of artistic cinema appears to have dissuaded everywhere stříkajícím brains and guts.
Supporters of action films with the force that will take over and bore no later than the time at which the issue forward from free to explain the reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries ships to Jerusalem, and will hang forever in wind and fog than obviously flies back the team to America and on there are silent.
There is, therefore, no surprise that, in Germany, "Rising Walhalla" didn't get into cinemas, and now was issued only on DVD.
It is a pity for a splendid záběrům, but also because a distinctive facade and broken blood, hiding exciting cinema, which deserved a little attention.
In this film is not about the dialogue, or the exact storyline, it's atmosphere, some dream, who became a film.
And that is not for the spectator of escape.
Refn he don " t him for a moment to unload and slowly choking him with the chill pictures and gloomy hypnotic soundtrackem, but, above all, whatever the hatred that the hearts of the characters.
Only a small blond boy who helps One-Eye, will retain something as innocence, all the others are driven by malice.
Of all buzzing hero, whose motives are never explained, which will happen in time for enemies and transitional ally warrior from hell, maybe envoy of the devil.
Starring the destruction, but also only for those wicked.
"Rising Walhalla" is a mysterious film, which is possible to hate and admire, for the EU, excitement and admiration.

Mysterious natural work
Office for nuclear energy of the IAEA has a new warning on a secret nuclear program in Syria.
Countries, however, prevent the expression - and even allow the control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 attack at least four Israeli combat airplanes F 15 and mysterious a square building in Syria.
Standing on the shore Euphratu; the nearest major city is remote 30 kilometres, and his name is as Dair Saur.
In the documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) is her name, though it is a reactor, who allegedly built by Syria with North Korea in this quadrant schovaném in the valley, which turns from the stream.
On the basis of the US / American foreign secret service of the CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the village el-Kibar, work well for the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
Technology from the 1950s is too convenient.
The CIA presented the video with nezaostřenými with satellite imagery.
Using a computer animation clarify where the reactor before the destruction of the components could be, is to be reduced, a copy of the North Korean model Yongbyon nuclear center.
Moreover, they were presented by photographs that showed the building up close, or even from the inside.
The reactor was supposedly shortly before running, but even without the fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, he doesn't know a lot more than that, even with the time.
If the former US President George W. Bush recently in his memoirs published that the CIA had been before the attack very sure that Syria is building in el-Kibar reactor, but, in fact, had no evidence that the country is "an active programme of nuclear weapons."
Some of the rapporteurs secret services in Europe are even more cautious and talk only about the "alleged reactor," even if the presentation of the CIA as a "convincing."
They lack clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
On the issue, as he is sure that the reactor, he said in the summer of a UN diplomat, the IAEA has "enough material to put the issue."
The rubble of the supposedly "unused military building" was the Syrians may quickly odklizená and also duly zarovnali terrain.
Yet managed to find in June 2008, the team of the IAEA under the leadership of the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was made by people.
In addition, the IAEA received the Member State via satellite photographs of commercial vendors of the period immediately after the attack, which should be the better than you, which has presented the CIA.
Unfortunately, these pictures are not on the market, because it is exclusively bought unknown customer - maybe Israel.
The IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that she never had a secret nuclear program, and neither does not create the reactor.
Uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, expressed with Damascus.
But it disproved the IAEA after analysis of the particles.
Since Damascus refuses to discuss the issue - as well as the satellite shot.
In addition, forbade revizorům the second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage rozbombardované buildings.
But also Israel remains utterly silent.
"We'll never comment," said recently an official position at the time of the ruling by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case is so drawn without result from June 2008 and "grows into a serious problem because of the credibility of the office," said a Western diplomat in the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - after all, it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, which is supervised by the IAEA.
The IAEA is considered a key to move forward on the other three facilities, to be "functional link" with the alleged reactor - and unlike him still exist.
The auditors did not cite so far, neither of which the device is, or what they are to function, or why they are suspicious.
According to the information, the newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung is the IAEA internally as Marj as Sultan, the Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived once again in nearby towns.
Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite pictures from a complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspects of objects.
Perhaps it is inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - exactly for this reason refuses to Syria the IAEA access to the three points.
In Vienna said that, the Syrians are afraid of the fishing expedition - that it was the IAEA sent in advance of the US, in order to spot the military base.
The nuclear detectives were drawn to the establishment of the US secret service.
The IAEA has the elements and also satellite images that between these three points and a square for Euphratu material transported here and there.
In Vienna said a Western diplomat, that at least one furnished should be "in connection with the production of fuel."
But there is "no evidence of senzibilních activities," that is, about the enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by a uranium, which is enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where he would later should secede plutonium for the bomb, on these central issues there are only likely estimates.
Also, it is not known whether the debris which could hide important clues, are kept in these three places.
As it disappeared from the face of the earth hundreds of the cost of freight wagons, no one seems to have the information, where the rubble.
Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar remote and, on the other hand, the salt mine Euphratu al Tibni that left Syria to check in 1998 as a warehouse for the radioactive waste, the wording of the IAEA as unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley gave it in connection with a reactor in one analysis of satellite imagery for a renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
Pictures from space but show that, after the IAEA requested access, carried out of Syria at all suspicious places natural work and removed large containers.
It could be a coincidence, but it didn't help clarify the suspicion.
In addition, talk about the diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent many months of the plan for revizory allowing Syria to preserve any military secrets - only that effort shows how big is interest revizorů.
Damascus, meanwhile, rejected even this proposal.
If a year ago, the same things the Western diplomats in Vienna, that's damaged reactor, and that is why this thing is no fire, speaks for several months, the U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies on the so called special inspections, which is one of the most brutal means, which has the nuclear authority to enforce controls.
Yukiya Amano, the head of the IAEA, which would have to propose inspection, already spoke of "options, which, in the future, I tend," so far, but it is reluctant.
This option offers great risk: On the one hand, it is the need of a majority in the Council of the IAEA and many represented 35 countries is certainly an interest in escalation.
On the other hand, both draws one diplomat: "What would happen if, in the end, they won't find anything?"
Love in the time of war
Since Angelina Jolie began in the summer to work on the still nameless overhead prvotině, there is a problem.
She wrote the script, this is a love story of women from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more, meanwhile, knows - but it is causing unrest.
Steadily talks about the woman who is a Muslim, in love during the war in Yugoslavia into the Serbian man who raped her.
Bosnian women's clubs immediately protest, so hastily planned to move the shoot from Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film, meanwhile, in Hungary dotočil and is in postproduction, in Bosensku, but still protests.
Bakir Hasecic of the female victims of war, wrote over the UN / organization to help the refugees, UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with an actress, have informed now Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also UN ambassador if the organisation to help the refugees.
It is not just a diplomatic - offered women weeks before the meeting in Hungary, but refused.
A meeting must be held in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In the campsite service, where znásilňovalo, love stories have been held and the position of the Jolie for the victims of it reveals a lot about the script.
Her organization therefore recommended that the UN / organization to help the refugees to Jolie released as the ambassador, inform the Guardian.
The scene exactly wrote Jolie?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given to read the script, relaxed after a minor wrangle in Sarajevo - the filming is not entirely clear, why then Jolie yet did not arrive.
The young author stresses that, in my movie tracking no political intentions, with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia that he wants to show the consequences of the terrible war and all interested parties to give the space.
Because of the content remains vague.
On the Internet is still a version of the film, which is really quite different: Lovers knew each other before the start of the war, and the way they meet, when is she like Bosnia's Muslim zavlečená into the Serbian camp, where he serves as a bodyguard.
This really is a lot different than the victim of rape, he falls in love with his tormentor ."
The fact that the movie Jolie really starts already before the war - it is true.
Jolie argues that she's stressed that "it is not fair and is based on erroneous information."
Now she can rescue it hekeři from Hollywood: By publishing illegally on the internet its scenario, as it has already done many times.
Nothing than away
This evening it is once again a good for the Irish people.
No trace after the grief.
Home team has dominated too significantly over their guests from Sweden, Finland, and the US.
Fans scream of joy for the sound of loud music, the legs.
Bailey-Pub in Cork jihoirském, because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and trefují.
"Beer pong" is called the bizarre theater, and it is possible to win the 500 euro as a premium and the ticket to Las Vegas for the World Cup in the beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is quiet type; this ukřičená beer game and reticent informatik, together that tune.
Yet seeks to 26 years old man talk, relaxing from the vexing question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not playing passion in Las Vegas, going in January, in an interview for the New Zealand.
"I have this weird feeling," he says.
"It's so far, and yet there I don't work."
Yet: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "immediately gained its dream job as Eventmanager, maybe it is a good sign," says the young man, and he's smiling.
Because of the poor prospects at home, to try to make their luck abroad for two of the three siblings Tannerů.
His sister Yvonne, the social worker is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with Tannerů looks in many families on the island.
100,000 of the Irish people will leave the country in the foreseeable future, experts predict the Scientific Institute for Economic and Social Affairs ESRI in Dublin.
Counted even by 2015 with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million people that is a major loss.
If the forecasts will confirm, there will be a similar expatriate wave of protrpělo Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of the rise, which has brought the Irish great prosperity, is now once again extends the unhappiness.
The economic crisis znejišťuje mainly young, educated the Irish people, who have seen so far only the rise.
The loss of employment and social descent seemed absurd boom in those years.
The need for everyone was, the money was to waste.
In the meantime, they are but three out of ten men and women within 30 years without a job.
In the Irish Times is the many letters of readers who complain: "In Ireland is everything from the hill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, that it is gone and our ground, it is losing a generation."
"The last may please will be the end of the story."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, the Irish president of the Student Union, sees the future of the black, because the government says only deceptive and young people offers no prospects for the future.
"Compose the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says 20 years.
Watching her classmates loop from one unpaid practice to the next.
The greatest concern is that it will have to move out for four years alone.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon trying to see the issue in a positive light.
McLarnon organises "WorkingAbroadExpo" exhibition, which offers a total service on the subject of work abroad.
"For beginners on the labour market is to work abroad after an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website are photographs of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: To work abroad are not lousy, but freedom and joy.
About what it is to build something somewhere else, he knows for half a year Seán O'Donovan.
Because 29 years old engineer in Ireland should not have any work, is now busy with 15 Irish colleagues at the construction in Germany.
Just puts in Gelsenkirchen fashion house.
In January, continues to Hanover or in Berlin on the next project.
About'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home, because he works in the extra innings to repay home loan on the house.
"The situation is sometimes a bit crazy," he says, when, for the first time in a long time exceeds the threshold of his own house.
"I'm making money in Germany on a house in Ireland, in which, in fact, I am not at all."
He's laughing sheepishly and walks vychladlými rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained small gardens in parked vjezdech large expensive cars.
The'Donovan bought a house with his sister four years ago, for the euro - 380.000 100 like financed by borrowing.
"It was a crazy time, easy money have been without many issues," he says.
The fear that it could well end up with a loan?
About'Donovan moment thinking, doleje hot tea and says: "I don't have the children, I would have had to feed and I'm young; even when everything goes wrong, I can start over again."
Structural engineer doesn't like complaining that now so often hears.
"One does not have to starve - our situation is not so dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"A moment to work abroad, it is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we will only feel like the Irish people."
He's laughing, and then tells of her father, who left in the last economic crisis in England.
"After seven years, he was back again and life in Ireland further, quite simply."
Cian Tanner has this idea.
Keep open future and simply wait, as it will be making life elsewhere.
Has had several years of work in London, and why it should not be in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend, also good?
But there is one other thing, which it in these days pretty concerned about: The celebration of his 27 birthday Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid that could go wrong at a farewell party.
"No emotion," he says, and drinks with a good beer.
"Goodbye, it is worryingly."
"Call it a party leaving, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, several games."
Normal practice democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing, as well as the support of private enterprise.
Crime raises greater concern than unemployment.
Brazil and many regions is considered more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the survey Latinobarómetro, which took place in the 18 countries, and left exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey held regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the entire area.
In this year's survey, which was held in September and at the beginning of October, is dominated by the two related things.
The first is that Latin America has a relatively cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of the positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
The promotion of democracy in several countries on the edge of the Pacific Ocean in South America has risen markedly (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where it is from the year 2002 economic growth in the average of 6% a year, increased support for democracy from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also increased in Mexico, where the economy was recovering after a deep decline in production in the last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most populated areas, are convinced democrats, which is the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the areas cited satisfaction with the way in their country of democracy works in practice, it is about the same number as last year, but in comparison with the year 2001, when it was about 25%, it is a big increase (Figure 3).
Around 34% said that they have confidence in the council in its country and 45% trust the government, again, it is the same number as last year, but it is the big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, has undermined democracy in Latin America, the economic crisis.
Aid during the global financial crisis is likely to be on the grounds that many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession, and with a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger network of social security would help protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, this week announced that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty has increased in 2009 only slightly and this year again fell to 32%.)
But the mood is changing in a wide spectrum from country to country (see chart 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and its popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more serious and worsened the status of violent crime.
Only the second time since the began to carry out surveys, they see more of respondents across Latin America as the most important problem of the crime, rather than unemployment (see chart 5).
Roughly 31% say that either they or their close relatives have become in the last year of the victims of the crime, but it is the decline compared with the figure of 38% from last year, and it is also the lowest number since 1995.
Robust economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: Around 71% of respondents across the region, says that private enterprise, it is necessary for the development, this percentage has risen from 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will enable the development of their countries, this percentage has risen from 47% from last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela has the same opinion (and 80% there supports private enterprise), although their leftist president, Hugo Chávez expropriating many private firms.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year without any change), and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% in the last year).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoys success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised the elections
No one expected that they will be the general election in Haiti on 28 November perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders, who are trying to help the country affected to be worried.
Elections gave a fountain with the ballot box, and repeating the vote, the ballot after rozmetané channels, broken voting and intimidation.
The room open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many přestěhovaných because of the January earthquake, a small round and trying to find out where they can go to vote.
Some of them, in the end, it gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a few forecast předběžců shouted that a fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
The protests, some of them violent nature, spread across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, he said that "in many ways, it was a pretty good election."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community carefully said that "they do not believe that such irregularities, whether they were any serious, not necessarily have to cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposition voices are bound to René Prévalovi, unpopular odstupujícímu President and his candidate Jude Célestinovi, it has to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All electoral hope is not lost.
The two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, rap, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, resigned from its original challenge to the vote was declared invalid.
But the problem can occur if Mr. Célestin, who has a small or negligible support among voters, will be marked in the electoral commission for having reached a crucial duel.
Because of the delirious cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people, who after the earthquake are still living in tents, there were fears that the turnout will be low.
Finally, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of them dezorganizace in it was prevented.
Roughly 250 thousand identity cards, which are necessary for the vote, remaining undistributed shortly before the election.
What is at stake is a lot.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a major step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, therefore, it is clear that the Haitians will place themselves.
Tiptoe into the Centre
In the weeks when suddenly was widowed, benefiting Cristina Fernández, Argentina's president, of the sympathy of the public, when its popularity has grown from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet reversing this success in a successful campaign for a second term in the election in the next year may depend on the mourners Mrs Fernándezová would give up my late husband's intransigence, the predecessor and political partner Néstora Kirchner.
And on these characteristics, everything will be based.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy, even after his wife successfully became president, he was in the habit of budgeting that downgrading tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend another revenue as it pleases.
The government of Mrs Fernándezové lost in the last year in the majority of Congress.
But the opposition is divided and was further destabilised in the death of Mr Kirchner on a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling political movement Peronist join Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (on which there has been hitting and blame the government of corruption), Congress could not approve the budget for 2011.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for the next year, and the president will have more room to spend as it pleases.
The economy is excessively overheating: This year is likely growth to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists is talking about the number, which is close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by an economic collapse, has set a priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than on the control of inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, the burden on the private sector and clean the INDEC, the statistical agency which came on the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
May now moderate Fernándezová president of this policy?
Called for negotiations between private businesses and trade union leaders.
And its officials say that they want to limit wage growth in the next year to 18%.
The economy was supported by the growth in world prices for Argentine exports of agricultural products.
But inflation has growth based on the big devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why Mrs President Fernándezová suggests that he wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government has created an agreement with the holders of bonds who previously rejected the debt restructuring, which Argentina in 2001 did not pay.
Madam President now faces Fernándezová agreement with creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about 6.7 billion dollars.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact had on the supervision of the IMF, as is usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, economy minister announced that the fund will provide "technical assistance" that was designed to be a new national spotřebitelsko-price index, which will remind introduction to the cleaning of INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether Mrs President Fernándezová will want to remain in politics after the end of the term of office, if the husband is at her side.
If you want to stay, he needs to win the support of the middle class, which is tired kirchnerismem.
At the time of the return of Argentine summer vacation, which is held in March, it will be a wave of sympathy to decline.
If he wants to win the next election, it will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to forego quietly with many views that her husband in politics.
Half encouragement for China
Taiwanští voters are closer to a closer link with the mainland.
What Taiwan thinks about his big brother over the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, voted for on 27 November, the mayor and the Council of the town in five urban constituencies, which can be considered a wider assessment of President Ma Ying and jeou.
Mr President Ma is itself represents the feelings which dominate the land, and they have a strong commitment in business relations, including an agreement on the part of the free market, in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
Mr President Ma passed the test, but only just.
Although his party, the Kuomintang (KMT) over winning three of the five offices of the mayor, has failed to win a majority of the votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favour of greater independence of Taiwan, won almost 50% of the vote against 45% of the KMT.
If this were a presidential elections, should President Ma problem.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of the votes of his party has decreased by approximately 8%.
For the first time was the party of the DPP together with the KMT in city councils.
Elections took place as the majority of Taiwan's election, including noisy electoral lorries and mass rallies with flags are dimly oděnými girls.
Was even mandatory part of the mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was canvassing for candidates of the KMT, on the eve of the elections.
The man from the crowd shot of a young Mr Lien purely over his face, it hurt and killed a spectator.
Bizarrely, it was not addressed whether he admitted grudgingly intend to hurt Mr Liena or settle the dispute with a candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP, says that the shooting influenced elections, the suspicion falls on the DPP and lead voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how she remained in the background of the question of the land.
Instead, the candidates were tilting on the plans for the state of residential and the creation of jobs.
Taiwan usually uses its de facto independence, and he hates the military threats of China.
KMT has a tendency to avoid links to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also dropped from vzbuzování de- Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to the fact and the realisation that the Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr President Ma for his party confirmed that China's policy is for the majority of Taiwan is acceptable.
From the government in Beijing can be expected to continue to continue commercial bribes, together with their strategies that Taiwan lured back to the herd.
China no time to send a negotiator to Taipeje to arrange the summit of investment protection and medical cooperation.
It would also like to see political integration, but in the right order.
It will be better to wait until after the presidential election in 2012.
Party DPP, in any case, found itself.
Two years ago, it was on the wrong level: Its former leader, Chen Shui-Bian, he was sent to jail on charges of corruption.
The president in 2000 / 08 was a troublemaker and supporter of clear independence.
But under Mrs Tsai has developed a new generation, which is moderate and the DPP has worked very hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms Tsai was provolávána DPP as a candidate for President, such as Su Tseng-Chang, who held the post under Mr Chen.
Their party now does all it can to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai published plans for research institutes, which serves as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Ms Tsai tells that the Taiwanese public that her party is a "a credible alternative" jumped to the approach of Mr Ma on China.
Mr Chen seems to be angry by this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell expressed the view that the DPP candidates would be a better place if insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
Even ordered Mr Su, pragmatikovi not to stand for president.
But even without the intervention of Mr Chen will be the DPP to fight on the selection among potential candidates.
KMT is justified to search for their own people.
Evaluation of Mr Ma were bad, and despite the rapid pace of economic growth; the candidates KMT with him did not want to go into the campaign.
His unpopularity seems to be based in particular unemployment and widening the gap between rich and poor.
KMT spokesman says that the size of its government, as well as a local branch.
Strongly promoted by the proposals to support Taiwan for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, as the majority of Taiwan's citizens of the economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chianga, prominent publicist, "the point of no return, has passed."

The planned mosque in Temecule receives approval of the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecule received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have hit the project that promotes terrorism, and will lead to the suspension of the trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre is in accordance with local laws and will be effective aesthetically.
"The many good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, you name it," said Hadi Nael, the President of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.

Opponents are still on the project can still appeal to the City Council.
The microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere
The discovery of strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, extends the scope for the search for new forms of life on Earth, and perhaps even further.
Researchers discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth, says that it is a sign that life has options that are outside the main elements that have been considered to be fundamental.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"Growth can either thanks of phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very special, but it is not proof that it is a kind of form of truly 'alien' life," commented this fact Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co- author of the report that appeared on Thursday in the online edition of the magazine Science.
For a long time, it was considered necessary for the life of six major elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake in California, they are able to continue with growth after for arsenic will replace the phosphorus.
"You will start to wonder what it is still possible," said D. Ariel Anbar of Arizona State University, co- author of the report.
This finding is significant for the search for life beyond Earth, because researchers must be able to detect life and to know how life can look like, he said Anbar.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, the message of this innovation published, just being discussed, which betrayed the details of the ruling, triggered a wide speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It is not so.
Discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to take advantage of the other elements that drive biochemistry, and that a series of elements, which we regard as' standard ', may not be for life so absolutely necessary," he explained to Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, of the Open University in Milton Keynes, Great Britain.
Cockell was not a part of the research team.
"This work is unusual, because it shows the replacement of one of the other element in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," he added Cockell.
It was not a random.
Felisa Wolf and Simon from Astrobiologického Institute at NASA, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake, because it shows a high level of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, she thought, then, that a microbe, which is exposed to the elements, it may be able to replace one for the other.
"The arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar of phosphorus."
"The result is that the organisms may very hard to these elements to separate."
"However, arsenic is so different that, as well as phosphorus is not working. If it gets into the organism, will begin work in the biochemical processes," said Anbar.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ 1 and the increasing concentration of arsenic, which the bacteria are able to adapt and growth.
Microbes grow better in the action of phosphorus, but whereas they may survive also with a refund arzenem, increases the possibility that a form of life, which makes use of arsenic, it may occur naturally, and either elsewhere on Earth, or on another planet or months ago, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, it is not new, but it has never found an example on which this was achieved.
Arsenic was more common in the old days on Earth, she said, and so scientists have speculated that it could benefit from earlier forms of life.
"That suggests that they could be other ways to create a life, not only in the way he created in the early period of the Earth," said Foster, which was not part of the research team of Wolf and Simon.
Research was supported by organisations of NASA, by the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stealing dogs were found in Compton
Two of the four remaining exhibition of dogs, which was stolen from a motel Bellflower, found. Informed about the sheriff of Los Angeles on Thursday.

"We follow the rules."
The owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peak, were unavailable to comment on the case.
They had a great delight in the middle of the afternoon of their two akity found in the shelter in Downey.
The sheriff representatives have found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.

Peak and Rickard, who lived in Redding, are this weekend in the city to participate in the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where they had planned to show Trace.
Other dogs had to compete in other competitions, planned in the days before the show, the AKC / Eukanuba show, said Peak The Times newspaper on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop at almost monthly travel after the pair of dog shows.
On Monday evening, the Peak and Rickard registered to a motel.
Often they sleep in motels and parked his car in front of the window of the room.
They took him also three dogs - a puppy of a boxer, Parson Russell terrier and the Breton - a pointer who stayed in the motel room.
Akita and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car, where it should be colder.

Lion is again prepared to scream now that the restructuring of MGM is obtained from the court of final approval
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty MGM finally got the green light to start again.
Insolvent federal judge New York on Thursday, officially blessed "in advance zabalenému" plan of creditors to settle about 5 billion of debt and to clear the way for 86 years old entertainment company, which focuses on the production and the production of films and television show.
Thursday's yield that the plan meets the requirements of the bankruptcy of the US do not remain MGM no legal obstacles to restart the founder of the Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who become the main leaders zeštíhleného of study.
The number of employees will fall roughly 320 from more than 400.
MGM has suddenly emerged from Chapter 11, with JP Morgan Chase until he agrees on the planned financial resources for a loan of $500 million, in order to finance new operation and production of MGM.
Now it is the connection with the investment bank, which itself needs $75 million, and the funding is expected to be around half of December.
The restructuring process of study began in May 2009, when it was hired investment bank Moelis & Co., to advise the management to resolve its finances, since management fought, so that he could afford the interest payments in the amount of $300 million a year.
This August was the President Harry Sloan replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Director General Enron and an expert on turnover, known for his work to Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts Moelise and Cooper to solve the financial problems of MGM and 140 creditors of study it took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed that, at the end of 2009 will give the company for sale.
Although the auction attracted a few bidders, none of them was willing to pay $2 billion plus finance, which called for the creditors.
In the spring of this year, it was back to the drawing board and the team MGM began to work on the restructuring plan. After months discussing and internal disagreement was the plan, at the end of the lender approved at the end of October.
If MGM officially will rise in the coming weeks from bankruptcy, companies Moelise and Cooper will receive for their work dollar bonuses in dollars.
Company Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, he will receive the payment of 9.5 million dollars.
Cooperovy firms that are making for their services, which runs the company, 375 000 dollars per month, will receive a reward for success, the "success fee" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to restore production at MGM, which this year has issued only one film, and to put together a proposal for seven or eight films, which will come at the beginning of 2012.
Plan also participate in the financing of the two films, the draft will be the book of the "hobbit," and that, together with Warner Bros.
Studio needs to negotiate a separate loan between 265 million and 275 million dollars to zafinancovalo its share of these two films, which will direct Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns around 18% of the debts of the MGM studio looking for the possibility of a merger with Lions Gate Entertainment, which is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies not yet resulted in an agreement.
Technological toys, which will keep your budget for gifts in balance
The candidate of this year is the most amazing toy iPad by videoherní system in both cases, but it is a substantial intervention in the budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of one iPadu you can buy five rounds of BMX for 99 dollars and one game Kinect costs like 10 bead švihadel or approximately 48 cups in Play Doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in the balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailer - Wal-Mart, Toys' R 'Us and BJ's wholesale bank Club - and watched what the electronic toys you can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that works Moore's law; this year's technological toys are far more energy, and at the same price, if not slightly lower than in previous years.
While there were relatively fewer new toys with affiliated sites, two of the most popular toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offers more.
The increasing number of toys with knoflíkovými batteries, as well as toys with batteries nabíjecími.
Here are some of the recommendations.
(All listed prices are from the Toys' R 'Us, except in cases which are marked otherwise.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from 3 years) are stuffed animals that sing when you press the tummy.
In one pressing issue pet tone and second grip will begin to create a song.
If you buy more than one, will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you begin to squeeze them, you can't stop.
The best option in the combination of song and dance is the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years)
Last year, I am on the Elmo Live technology borrowed 14 inch animatrickou doll, which can play the game of Simon Says, and the monthly walk through its innovative hinged leg with the locking wheel.
Children are testing a toy Mickey dance instructor, even though their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you may recall the Alphie, one of the first computer of educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro / Playskool units, $40, for the kids from 3 years), with a backpack full quiz cards, which are designed to drive into a fun with the work of the samoopravným, clever working workbook.
If after pošilháváte smartphonu for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60 for kids from 3 to 8 years), it is the cheapest option, with the simple use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games are not as effective as a teaching Leapster Explorer ($70, for the kids from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change of Leapster from Leapfrog, with newer and a clearer display.
No version is not compatible with older units.
If the iXL from Fisher Price ($90, for children from 3 to 7 years) system uses iTunes, private to the introduction of the game and the books, and it has a slot on the SD card, which allows you to display family photos.
Finally, the Qualification Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years) is a file of five blocks, which are not more than a box of matches, each of them has LED display.
The aim is to create words placing blocks in a row, before it expires the time; it's great for competition in the improvised formation of words.
Still more toys have at least some kind of online connections.
In the highest degree have been in toy stores everywhere represented two toys Webkinz and Club Penguin.
If you want to buy your child online toy from the Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for children from 6 to 12 years), in which a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child receives enough credits in the shop Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include the need to roller skates or pet Puffle.
A little more than he is your štětinka tooth brush is Hexbug Nano ($10, for children from 5 years), the latest in a series of on mikrorobotů knoflíkovou battery.
The beetle is moving fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It is funny, if you do the maze of cubes and watching whether he will be able to find a way out.
It is also very resistant.
He has been able to fall with the kitchen table, and even spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
The introduction of the softer police control in China
An urban military instructor, went Tang Shenbin after the square, strictly controlled his orders and issuing orders in a hoarse voice with military authority.
He wanted to - the female member of the Chinese sturdy vymahatelky urban right, feared and despised for their crackdowns and a taste for the violence - the impression of a group of a broker kolemstojících.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them whispered quietly, "as they look nice girls!"
The four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers up to attention.
Four pairs of black boots are made as a ruler.
Four headgear a perfect fit on her hair, which are completely tied a blue and white ribbons.
"I believe personally that they look on average," he said disdainfully Mr. Tang.
"Models are nice."
More than one government has sought to revive the image of city guards in China.
One city ordered that new recruits had a university education.
Sedo's Guangdong province has changed if green uniforms on the supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in Central China has replaced the stare for a strong armament: In 2009 was in one report indicated that 50 officers were surrounded by firmly the trolley with lunches and stared at the owner watched the itinerant vendor after a half hour packed and left.
Xindu, urban district with 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu was chosen as the main image of the operation.
From 2003, the district added a city police on 13 women who have been selected specifically by its appearance, the symmetry and a young age.
The aim is to show gross pages in addition to the police also softer, the feminine side.
Unfortunately, the Scarlett Johansson should trouble to get into the secret of the Chinese urban groups.
The critics argued for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers is only allowed to promote urban bylaw, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media normally capture a different reality.
In January 2008, the police inspectors from Hubei Province utloukli neutral spectator to death after he used his cell phone to shoot, as they do in the crackdown on the protest against the site.
Last year was the training of police officers in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the internet. In the manual was, among other things, a description of how effectively beat up the perpetrator with no signs of blood.
This year got a duffer with melons in Shanghai into a fight with five policemen and injured the left side of the brain.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded from the Internet, shows the Chinese policemen, as attacking a street vendor.
"Chengguan scared the government," the China Daily, the national edition, said last year after another debate about the tactics.
On the paper was "really thoroughly cleaning."
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised in October interest in eight new female officers, an editorial The Beijing Evening News was concerned with the issue of whether women have a real obligation or are only a distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
District requested a female student at the age of 18 to 22 years with a good figure, and "five features in the right proportion."
Adeptky should have altitude higher than the average - thus higher than the 1.6 metres.
Pasture at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials argue that the work is psychologically too difficult for women over 25 years.
"Their image is an important thing," said one senior White House policeman on rednet.com like government website.
The candidate must first demonstrate external quality, which then determine further, including height, weight, features, etc. "
Then comes to a number of nature and "internal quality."
Women are like flower vases, he said, and he added, "In addition, that will be the vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the management of the county town, does not agree with this description of power.
But say that the requirements of the portrait are normal in China also for other jobs, and that for both sexes.
As well as a requirement for symmetrical features of the face.
Which means that the issue of the good appearance is the subject of discussion between the Chinese.
Handicapped or mutilation is certainly no effect.
"Cannot allow for us was lame or a man," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image would not be good."
Liu Yi, which keeps watch on the square Baoguang in the vicinity of the monastery, has 22 years, faces like apples and gently shaped mouth.
We do not consider that the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist character, she said.

Prosecutors will not blame the senator Ensigna
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensigna of criminal charges which covered his affair with a former adviser for the campaign, and his efforts to ensure the lobby, they announced in the middle of the senator of lawyers.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr. does, nevadský Republican, faced and was, until the scandal, considered as a possible Republican candidate for president for the year 2012. His affair get into national headlines and damaged his career.
Office of Mr Ensigna said that it was the decision that followed almost a year after the investigation, "certainly pleased."
Senator could still face a disciplinary procedure by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr Ensigna lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that the senator does not be the aim of the investigation, and that it is not in the plan to raise additional charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department on the case has refused to comment.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, who claimed that there is clear evidence that Mr. does prepared the violation of the ban on federal lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, which were published in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that Mr. does helping Douglasu Hamptonovi, one of his assistants, to secure lucrative lobbies, which should lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about senátorově relationship with her.
Madam Hamptonová once worked as cashier Ensigna in the campaign.
Mr. does contacted a range of political supporters, to find work for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after the job of Mr. Hampton, lobbied for them, so much state documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was until recently, an assistant of Mr Ensigna, was by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate of the year.
Experts on ethics claim that unusual settlement of Mr Ensigna and Mr Hampton, who were in front of the friends, was in breach of the prohibition on lobbying.
From the evidence, which were published, "it became clear that it is a clear case of violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defense clients, who are investigating the government.
While officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the case of Senator Ensigna, Mr Brand and other lawyers specializing on Ethics said that the Ministry is cautious with regard to political actions, after a large number of failures, including the decision of last year to suspend the proceedings against former Senator Ted Stevens amid charges of failures of the prosecution service.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hiding weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), the group that was lodged in the matter of a few complaints against Mr Ensignovi.
"It shows in the fact that the senior government officials, the laws do not apply," she added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Mr Ensigna, said in an interview that he called on Monday, the Ministry of Justice and, subsequently, then the next day, and he said that the Ministry neshledalo no charges against his client.
Defense team of Mr Ensigna cooperates with prosecutors in an attempt to convince them that Senator, as his office said in Wednesday's statement, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments which handed the government representatives.
"I'm not pleased relate the details of my discussions with the Ministry of justice, in addition, that we think that they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to stop the investigation of a separate complaint in which ethical group gives the charge that the payment of parents Ensigna in the Hamptons on the amount of $96,000 violated the federal electoral law.
Election Commission said that it did not have enough evidence to show that the money was nothing other than a gift.
One company, for which Mr does help Mr Hamptonovi find lobbying work, was company NV Energy, the main nevadská company, which for a long time to support the senator.
One email from December 2008 showed that, after Mr. Hampton in society to work as a lobbyist, a leading staff of Mr Ensigna - John Lopez - communicated with Mr Hamptonem and said that "battered" in the Ministry of Interior on the subject under discussion.
Mr. does also involved in lunch with Mr Hamptonem and other client nevadským, Allegiant Air and called on the Transport Minister, that he set up a meeting on behalf of airlines after they begin by Mr Hampton on lobbying work.
When the last year, for the first time, a report on the affair, Mr does apologized to their voters and resigned, as the fourth Republican leadership in the Senate.
After months of stagnation Mr. does two weeks ago, he told reporters that he plans to take part in the third term in the Senate.
In the report that Mr does already is not the aim of the criminal investigation of his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hopes that the Ethics Committee will quickly follow the Justice Department and stop the entire investigation.
"Senator does looks forward to continue their hard work in the name of nevadského of the people," she said.
Invitation of Cheshire is turning to Twitter
In the courtroom, half a dozen books.
A minute by minute issue reports on the horrendous testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140 000 messages on Twitter and přivazováním addressed the rape of children to their beds in the house, which was lit.
Thursday was held on the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was sentenced for killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, the family, and it was held the official termination with the imposition of the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But lawyers by Mr Hayes has already submitted the appeal court with requests and arguments that the court is likely to be employed for years.
One of nejprovokativnějších is that the intensive reporting process - including the widespread use of Twitter the main reporters - has created "a circus atmosphere" and this extended, the immediate penetration information with pobuřujícími details then erected a jury at the decision in terms of the effect on the view of the public.
This claim could force the judge to address the question of whether, with the rise of new technologies do not require the new rules in the courtroom.
"I felt it at this trial, I think that there is a real danger that the integration of new technologies in the court affects the right of a fair process for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the main advocate of Mr Hayes.
The judge of that process, Jon C. Blue State Supreme Court briefly refused the claim on the return of the last week, and with the fact that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there is no evidence that would show that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But it is not likely to be the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts recognise that the news coverage of these notorious cases may cause questions about the fairness of the process.
In a regulation from the 1966 Supreme Court of the United States cancelled the condemnation edition chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, which, in its decision, he said that in the case of the Sheppard versus Maxwell, is in the process of the reason, the media was a "party atmosphere."
Some are convinced that this offence was an inspiration the television show and film "Uprchlík."
Some lawyers said that courts of appeal to review the judgment Hayesův half a century later, might be surprised by arguing that it could be necessary new rules that determine the way of communication of the courtrooms, which was in the case of Dr Sheppard unimaginable.
"There is a common cause for concern about the impact of new media" in the highly controlled cases, said John J., Donohue III, a professor of legal Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut, and he wrote a report which said that it was exercised freely.
Professor, Donohue said that some judges may be consumed with the idea that restrictions on the immediate communication of courtrooms may make the process fairer.
The case of Twitter is only one of the many lawyers outlined by Mr Hayes, who would be able to argue for years to delay implementation of the judgment.
Advocates also, for example, says that in the case of Mr Hayes may be a bias, if the Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential jurors by the selection of the jury will show criminal photography an awe-inspiring.
Some of the jurors have said that they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, which has become if Jennifer Hawke Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Advocates argue that also refuse the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge wrongly dismissed the judge, who was critical of government representatives, and that its decisions incorrectly put more pressure on the verdict and routed the jury to this weekend.
Of the jury were not separated.
But their arguments about the extent of the impact of the process may attract the greatest interest.
Stated in opposition against a verdict vzneseném last month that the case dominated reports in Connecticut, and has been discussed during the electoral campaign, the candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media constantly the flames were fanned by emotion in the matter of this case.
"The daily rush of media cameras and reporters before the court," wrote lawyer, "it was something here in New Haven has still not been to see, and this is perhaps also the national curiosity."
Their focus on the action of Twitter is controversial.
Some journalists in the talks claimed that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports of that later and from their point of view, should the judicial police to drive the scope of other processes.
But some lawyers called for courts of appeal with the arguments that the social and technological changes require adjustment of the courts.
Lawyers by Mr Hayes seek this right.
In its archives referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966 on the judgment of Dr. Sheppard, because of the scale of the impact of the process, and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is a case Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy to overcome the gap?
After the campaign, which was a remarkable and urážlivostí negativismem, this week in Washington appeared a small quantity of courtesy.
It is the first sign of true cooperation of two political parties or only iluzivní moment before a rapid return to the fight in the party in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting of President Obama and the parliamentary leadership has not produced any major discoveries on the crucial issues that must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, but it was a polite discussion of the differences in opinion of the two parties, as well as defining their joint responsibility, rather than another empty episode of party competition.
Wednesday's public session of the president's deficit commission was also civilised, and despite political differences between members remain.
It seems that it is clear that the close collaboration over a period of several months to build mutual respect, which transcends the ideological divide that still divides members.
And it is quite difficult to argue that she began a new era of cooperation.
Both parties are now in the test period - sondují other signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to evaluate the boundaries of public opinion and electoral patience towards a renewed partisan war.
It was therefore also Tuesday's negotiations and its subsequent assessment of participants, carried out with the minimum requirements or recrimination.
Philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too large and too deep to propose a rapid change in the conditions that are there for the last two years.
Whether the issue of taxes, spending, health care, or rights, the two sides are miles away.
Nevertheless, the November elections prepared Washington, at least, quickly.
"The question is not whether the change of regulatory matters," said Pete Wehner, Bush's admin, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"You are inevitable after the election.
Elections pump up the emotions followers and then fell silent.
It is good. "
In a number of issues, especially those that are to be discussed at the meeting, the Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and it is not considered to be favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, and a permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because the Republicans cannot look on how they support the reduction in taxes for the wealthy, while the unemployed reject unemployment benefit.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House is to see greater optimism about the possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of the new opening of the contract.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution notes that a successful cooperation on major issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of two political parties, when 112 Congress convened in January.
Rather, it is the likely period of disagreements, or even inevitable, he said.
"After they will do things that must be done, the psychology in the short term, will return to one of the confrontations," said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is greatly extended - the courtesy will lead is real cooperation.
"I look at all events between now and 2012 as the shadow boxing, when the main events occur in the year 2012," he said.
Reasons largely has to do with the construction of the new Republican majority in the White House, and the electorate of tea parties who helped create it.
Republican leaders now faces the risk of exaggeration, they know that they must live up to its promises and must reduce the expenditure of the government and cancel the new law on health care.
These přívrženecké lines are clear in the initial reactions to the recommendation on the deficit, which include reform of the tax code and the increase of certain taxes, an increase in the retirement age and a reduction in expenditure.
The Joint Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington, and they are, in his opinion, press the issue of the deficit to the public programme in ways that cannot be ignored.
They need but 14 votes in 18 member Commission to his plan to introduce as an official recommendation and then fought to get to this number as much as possible.
The biggest resistance is between elected officials in the jury, who propose that, in the case of the financial issues we have, at least today, small foundations or willingness to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflict, when the Republicans invite Obama to address the budget, taxes and health care, which will be followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What will drive a shift?
The public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that, despite the partisanship in the last election, the majority of Americans wants to continue to see the two sides, which are working together.
If it could be directed to the stalemate, as was the case in 1995, then both parties will be very closely monitor the response of the public.
Anyone would risk reduction of the vote, will change course and probably will be looking for a compromise.
This may be an optimistic view of the matter.
And the partisanship of guidelines are more today than it was in the middle of the 1990s shows that a larger ideological divide between Obama and the Republicans than it was in the case of the Republicans, and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to a more important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, courtesy, which occurred this week, would prefer that many Americans.
It will be the state but many efforts on both sides to find common ground on issues, which is still divided.
The American leaked document portrays Moscow as a refuge corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of the "kleptokracie" and the continuing part of bribery and bribery for protection, which come on the way to Kremlinu, gave the American embassy in Russia in the records of February.
Federal police and security service largely hold protective wings, which help to explain the high cost of the life in Moscow.
Collect the money not only from legitimate business but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "the updraft office" - will marry their, if the money begins to move up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington under the name of John Beyrleho ambassador, was in the centre of the made public by WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on sources, whose names was redigována.
The record was written at a time when he was still Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
It was revoked in October President Dvořák Medvedevem, but since we can monitor only minimal changes in cleaning.
Luzhkov, and his wife Yelena Baturina, which owns prominent construction company, for many years, constantly denying charges of corruption, and he won a number of legal actions for false charges for such accusations.
In September, he said to the Russian television station, when he was asked on the demonstrated testimony of corruption: "It's crazy, it's ugly, it's crap."
Russians with absolute conviction they believe that, if the company's corrupt, it will show it to the vote.
However, it is unusual to meet with such details vyřčenými in such a way, and it in ambasádní report, and it is also outrageous that would do that diplomats from foreign countries.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its connection with some criminal elements have led to it called 'dysfunctional," and confirmed that the government is more like kleptokracie, than as the government, "says the report.
"Criminal elements are from the 'krysha' (the term of the world and the criminal, the mafia, which literally means' top 'or protection), which provides them with the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the prosecution office, just as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts and have identified three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are on the second stage."
"And, finally, at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is ineffective system in which the criminal groups filling the empty space in some areas, as the city does not provide some of the services."
The report says that the FSB takes money from the largest firms and police is focused on smaller businesses.
One source said, "the owners of stores in Moscow recognize that it is better to get protection from the FSB, or the Ministry of Interior (rather than by organised criminal groups), since they do not have only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law."
"For this reason has the protection from criminal gangs is not so in the course."
The record says that, while the selection of money is a comprehensive, the protection of the very may already be in trouble; and those who pay, can sometimes be arrested.
To those who do not pay enough, with their business under various pretexts closing.
Medvedev is several times spoke about the fight against corruption, but he admitted that he did only a little progress.
Ambasádní report speaks of men taking cases, probably with cash, into the very Kremlinu.
"In its fight against corruption with Medvedev is must rely on bureaucrats," he said in a recent interview, Georgy Satarov, the director of the Moscow research team, an Indian.
"Is but part of this red tape."
"Is not part of the political class, because the political class in Russia has already exist."
Without the politicians, without opposition, without the division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Some estimates that stands nationwide corruption Russia more than $300 billion a year.
Countries are on 154 place in a recent survey on global corruption perception NGO Transparency International (countries are sorted from at least for the most corrupt).
Revelations of the report of the American embassy in Moscow appeared in the late evening hours certainly provoked by the Russian government enthusiasm, although only to the extent that for Moscow's shortcomings may be accused Luzhkov, it may be for the Kremlin way to argue in the matter of the solution to the problem.
In an interview for CNN with Larry King told Putin that the documents that WikiLeaks published could be counterfeit and reacted angrily to the statements that American diplomats call Medvedeva Batman and Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that it is about our mutual synergies, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But, to be honest, we did not think that it will be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so neeticky."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to deal with the past
In the classroom with concrete walls oloupanými zašpiněnými and remind the headmaster Anlong Veng High School of the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here love The Moka."
"Was a good leader, and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for its brutality during the Khmer Rouge, remains the commander in this remote estate of the Khmer Rouge in the northwest Cambodia popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where he still lives thousands of former soldiers of this organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered government, she's busted lasting loyalty also in Anlong Vengu.
In April was for the victims in the forum of truth and reconciliation are allowed to publicly confront with the people who were part of the scheme.
In June, the government has provided the textbook for the first time, children explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July to raise together the UN and Kambodžský court first condemnation of the former member of the Khmer Rouge, a conviction of the former leader, a thuggish association of the notorious Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, more widely known as the Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such progress, increased anxiety among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, which complicates the efforts for reconciliation, and their attempts to engage in Cambodian society.
"Between the former Khmer Rouge trials is hatred and fear, but are powerless to do anything," said Youk Chhang, head of the Documentation Centre Cambodia, an independent organisation which examines the regime.
"For them was a beautiful life between the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"Divides the family."
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or processing.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot in 1979, remains of the regime and its soldiers have fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There launched an uprising, which lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary regulated the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles in Western Cambodia, and Ta Mok cultivated supporters in Anlong Vengu.
But in the mid 1990s, after the peace agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country was conducted to the first democratic elections in 1993. A large group of the warriors of the Khmer Rouge began to go to the government, which culminated in a surrender in 1996, Ieng Sary and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who has endured, in 1999 was captured by government forces in the mountains nedalých Dangrek.
He died in Phnom Penhském prison in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Their patrons nepečovali about them, the majority of the former Khmer Rouge fighters sank in ordinary Cambodian rural life and many of them nostalgically recalls for a period of the movement.
Although a few elite of the Khmer Rouge to keep their local government's position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unskilled farmers.
"These people were of the surrender of a minimum benefit," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and reconciliation, which leads public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by a utopian agrarian ideology regime."
"Were brought up without any ideas on the implementation of the trade."
SOR Lim, 55, which came to the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, he fought in the jungle around Anlong Vengu before it settled as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was a good," he said.
"The Mok all sustenance."
"But now is a hard life, because all we have to ensure themselves."
The ongoing trial of the Khmer Rouge also caused concern.
At the beginning of next year, the court will start to investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court has a mandate to prosecute leading přestavitele and the people responsible for the crimes, but has not said whether it will continue also in the four cases.
It was just a little to calm the fears in Anlong Vengu.
The recent speculation of the media focusing on Im Chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she said researchers from the Centre in Cambodia that supervise the construction of dams Trapeang Thma, the project, which may have killed thousands of forced workers.
A recent sultry evening Im Chaem returned from work in the field in his wooden house on the dirty track outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and there were shadows across the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about the past between the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she refused to go.
"In Cambodia of peace and is stable," she said.
"If you will discover other criminal prosecution, will be a war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ran from the Khmer Rouge in 1978 also repeatedly warned that the instability, if the Court will seek further suspects, although the experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and buried in the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is only what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Youk Chhang of the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation in khmerským proportions means cobble together broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to give these broken pieces together so that we could understand."
Centre has issued the first textbook approved by the government of the Khmer Rouge, has 75 pages and the name of the "History democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June as a supplement to the book of the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four sides of the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, also the young people in Anlong Vengu knew only a few details of the Khmer Rouge, despite the merger of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the high school in Anlong Veng, he said that the new textbooks helps students to understand the important part of their history.
But his parents have reacted skeptically, when he took home book to study.
"My family refuses to many parts of the books and the courts," he said.
"Are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people will be a court prosecution."
Such resistance is the process of reconciliation more complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forum, textbooks and the court are beginning to have an impact, said further.
The Khmer Rouge are still a strong spell.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains path is overgrown with weeds and walk odhozenými plastic bags, which leads to the rectangle of black soot covered with a rusty iron roof.
Body of Pol Pot here was burned on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a salesgirl cellphones on the edge of the road, said that he doesn't know a lot about the man who was cremated in that place.
"But it has a strong spirit, many local people here go and pray for him," she said.
Sothea Nuom had a birthday and planned later to visit a place of rest Pol Pot, where it will bring the volume of ripe banana in the hope of gaining a fortune.
Belarus agrees that it seems their stocks of weapons on a basis of uranium.
In a startling victory in the campaign of President Obama on the security of nuclear material around the world, announced the government of Belarus on Wednesday of abandoning their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after a security summit, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Foreign Minister by Sergei Martynov.
The American government has for years sought to persuade the Belarus to relinquishing the highly enriched uranium, and it seemed that the stumbling block came last spring.
But American officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months, with Belarus was carried out a couple of classified operations to remove 187 pounds of uranium weapons on the basis of the Belarusian Research facility.
It paves the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - about 500 pounds, according to the official, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
Agreement has proven to be one of the most important results of the Obama 47 national summit on nuclear safety in April, to which Belarus was discarded.
And he was probably a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic in a subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want to place at the summit on nuclear bezpečnosti2012."
"It shows that the process is working," Ken said Luongo, president of the Partnership for the global security, the group supporting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement as a "very important, an important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, it will ensure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all of its stock of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama summit on nuclear safety announced Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, that his nation will never surrender its uranium.
"We have the highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is, in fact, the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," he said after President Lukashenko.
"It is our commodity... Nehodláme to produce dirty bombs and also we are not going to sell it to anyone."
"We use it only for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, a few months ago, has acceded to the United States and made clear interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove the Belarusian uranium in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was slightly irradiated, officials announced.
He was loaded on a special train, which traveled more than 1 300 miles into Russian facilities for the storage and disposal, officials said.
The second operation was concluded on Monday, and was carried out by air, the officials said.
The American government for the programme spent 13 million dollars, most of it on the supply of the Belarusian Research Institute less enriched uranium, which is for the production of nuclear weapons.
"All was zkoordinováno very carefully and managed on the basis of trust," which led to an agreement signed by the Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the Study of the NPT, this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium applicable for the production of weapons.
Belarus will be, according to the joint statement, to seek the removal of its supply by 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained over the years, largely for Lukašenkově harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of gradual thaw.
"We welcome progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus, that consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis of the improvement of mutual relations, and it is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government done with the CIA flights guzzling
The Spanish government wouldn't keep secrets about the CIA flights carrying trapped talibance and members of the Al Qaida in Guantánamo via the Spanish territory, as he put it in his telegram envoy of the United States in Madrid.
So it is clear from the documents provided by the Wikileaks newspaper El País, which also writes that the first deputy prime minister María Teresa de la Fernándezová Vegová request that the Spanish executive informed and "could then show that he has the proper supervision of foreign aircraft prolétajícími Spanish airspace."
In June 2006, after the communication of the Council of Europe, in which it was blamed for a dozen states, including Spain of complicity in breach of human rights, a meeting took place between the US ambassador and Eduard Aguirre Fernándezovou de la Vegovou.
Deputy Prime Minister said that communication of the Council of Europe "expose the Zapatero Government of the game," and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vegová stressed that Spain has no problem with flights of the secret services across its territory.
"Simply want to be informed" that they weren't "caught off guard," tells Aguirre in one of the documents.
Also the former Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos indicated the American Ambassador, that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible contours, but the fact that this thing was in the hands of the judiciary, the government had limited opportunities to influence."
In February 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González said the Embassy that if his concerns, has no intention to block the initiative of the judge to ask for disclosure of documents of the National Centre of secret services (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"It contains any folder inkriminovanou or any sensitive information," explained the Embassy after the interview with the chief justice.
Nevertheless, the US have expressed concern rather because of the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" than because of the disclosure of information or CNI of the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to solve this case discreetly between governments," deplores Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the lunch, and the US ambassador's Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaby, told the ambassadors that, "although they are Spanish judges very jealous of its independence, and they do what will be considered appropriate," the instructions already searched by associates, "whether they avoid rozohněným comments with the intention of reducing tension."
The Ambassador also expresses its concern about the political parties, the Partido Popular (PA; Czech Popular Party EIRGRID in this matter.
"Despite her general pro-American orientation of our experience, the Partido Popular will not hesitate to use any indication that the government tolerated Zapaterova or deliberately ignored the meeting of the US, which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even in the event that this could have negative consequences for the government of the United States," he notes.

In July, there is a further contribution.
When vyťukává this report, it is assumed that the child, which arrived on the island of the first day of this month, and it was probably murdered 10., is already dead.

PP would gain 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia EIRGRID would lose 9 mandates
With the results from November 28, the PP Party could have the word on radnicích in Léridě, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes and experienced Members during recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PA (Popular Party of Catalonia EIRGRID already has the idea of a general election, whether there will be an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in national elections is usually once a Catalonian from the elections.
In 2008 gained katalánští KDU 610.473 votes in the general election, while in the election of autonomous from 2006, this figure was only 316.222.
Last Sunday has acquired PPC (Popular Party of Catalonia) 384.091 voice.
If this trend increases, which was supported by the transfer of the votes from the PSC and the loyalty of voters PA, analysts of that Party have calculated that, if the election, PPC could get 12 Members in the House, compared to the current 8, the Party (CiU Convergencia i Unió, Czech Match and Union EIRGRID would gain also 4 mandates (now has 10), and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These calculations would have confirmed that Catalonia has for the PP and the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Party) to become crucial importance.
According to this analysis, the grouping of the Left Party ERC (Republican Party of Catalonia EIRGRID lost one Member - now has 3 - while the ILE (Green Initiative for Catalonia EIRGRID would continue to have a mandate, or she would gain even one another.
However, in the manner of the electoral calendar will be held in May 2011, on the occasion of the municipal elections, where they could also have the PP a decisive influence on the end of the domination of the Socialist Group in four main provincial cities and also for changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest budget plans - 661 million euros for the year 2011.
Both nationalists and PP agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the city hall in Barcelona, Tarragona, and Léridě Geroně, where the Socialists have not received majority, and would not be able to turn to its traditional allies, the ERC and Ile.
Given the debacle of Republicans would not be impossible, if this party has lost its representation in the Barcelona Representation - since it is necessary to obtain a minimum of 5% of the vote.
Party PP has increased the number of votes in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Léridě and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a key role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled together the party to PP before the current mayor, Josepem Félixem Ballesterosem.
In Léridě acquired PA only about 500 votes more than the PSC, the mayor of the Angel Ros has very good relations with Marianem Rajoyem - during the last campaign has gathered on several occasions.
PP gained also on other important radnicích like Badalona, or Castelldeels Reus.
Currently, the PA representation on 34 radnicích in Catalonia and would like to create a female candidate in the municipalities.
The Catalan cell provided the organization Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, were picked up another three in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerijec arrested agents of an information office in Barcelona, was a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, which arranges for passports to different groups of the organization Al Qaeda, among whom were also "the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam," or "/ Lashkar e-Taiba," while the second group was the author of the attacks in Mumbai, in which 106 people were killed in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches to the investigation of this matter of great importance, seeks to ensure that using the "operation Kampai" weakening padělatelského apparatus of Al Qaeda on an international level and "limit its operational capacity."
Investigators estimate that this cell could during the two years, when it was in Catalonia active, to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where, then, have been counterfeited and then shipped groups that make up the galaxy criminal organisation of Al Qaeda, to their "warriors" can travel with impunity across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell has not been the only active, jihad network in Europe, and therefore these investigations except the Thai services also participated in other European police units, and therefore, it cannot be excluded that in the coming days will not happen in other European countries for similar intervention, as was the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In the context of this operation (they were detained Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer and Arshad Nigerijec Babatunde Agunbiade) in Thailand has developed further, in which they were captured by the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was these men, who was driving from Bangkok cell based in Spain and another in other European countries.
Catalan network, whose part was destroyed in 2009, in particular stealing tourists passports, which comply with the requirements of the Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men in the age of 25 to 45 years, had to have the force of a few years, and be marked without a visa.
In investigative documents, it is pointed out that we are not aware of any facts to connect the detainees from Catalonia, with the assassination in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, "if Lashkar e-Taiba," he should be one of the groups that have received passports stolen in Spain and then falsifikované in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination was sent from Catalonia transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "put" for the purchase cards to mobile phones, which later were used by members of the "commandos" that killed 106 people.
The police have already confiscated many evidence.
The People's Party (PP) requires Masovi to stop fiscal agreement
President of the Party PPC (Popular Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchezový-Camachová yesterday had the opportunity to present himself Arthur Masovi their conditions under which it is willing to support the function of the president of the Generalitat; these conditions are identical with those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is the recovery of the economy and the renunciation of the risky enterprises as an economic agreement, which wants the leader of the nationalists to propose during his mandate.
President of the Catalonian grouping came to the meeting with Arturo Masem with certainty 18 parliamentary seats received in elections of last Sunday, which is a number more than satisfactory to gain popularity, therefore candidate CiU needs to be at least one of the formations of the opposition abstained from the vote on his appointment in the office.
On the possible agreement with PA depends on the future of the alliance, which would like to keep the nationalists in the House, and will be a general election, but so far the talks, which leads in these days of Mas with the rest of the political leaders, are in Catalan spirit.
Regarding the PA to gain its support for the entry into office, "it will have to do away with any sovereign and Liberation speeches," as well as an economic agreement - similar to the one from the Basque Country - which wanted leader of CiU even have to vote in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slim down inflated political apparatus of the autonomous administration and reduce the inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations about masova entry into the function will be dealt with in the context of the PA Jordi and Cornet Dolors Montserrat.
You already met Joaquinem Nadalem (PSC), which promised a tough opposition Joanem Herrerou (ILE) and today will meet Joanem Puigcercósem (ERC), Albert (Riverou Ciutadans) and Joanem Laportou (Solidaritat Catalana).
Director of complex geriatric accounting device assures that the deaths occurred as a result of a "lack of action."
Performance centres Olot do not exclude that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the complex geriatric accounting Centre de la Caritat Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to vylíčilo, what caused the damage to the institution of criminal behavior of the Villa Dilmé Joan, carers, which - while there, he was employed - killed at least eleven of elderly people in care.
The director of this home for seniors Joan Sala came accompanied by a lawyer of equipment, an attorney Joan Canada, and said that "the wishes of the home La Caritat would be able to bring charges against the guilty" responsible for killing, but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to leave this process by the competent authorities."
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because the time revealed the criminal activity of carers, a major threat to the home of the la Caritat represent now requirements for material compensation already calculate the legal representatives of the families of the survivors.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime was already in August 2009, and that from this time kill
Judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies clients home for the elderly, with a suspicion that, in many cases, at the dead; no doctor in person, but that, given the age and the poor state of health of the patients - everything vyřizovalo over the phone.
La Caritat yesterday through his manager firmly rejected this extreme and stressed that "the lack of action could not be the cause of it in any way, which it did."
Legal representative la Caritat he added that "in the case, there are no indications that, in addition to his own accused any third person committed misconduct."
Now a man dubbed "the angel of death," he admitted yesterday, 11 killing and clarified that the first crime committed 29 August 2009 and about a month and a half later killed the old lady.
In this case, the death was caused by too high doses of insulin, unlike the first case, when he used the combination of reassuring tablets.
Director la Caritat to say that it is difficult to control access to the staff medikamentům.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives may have been in six cases from nine means this caregiver used to the patients killed in his efforts to relieve suffering from them.
But only analyses now take place in the laboratory, they should show whether Vila lies and actually looking for its first victims less cruel death or, on the contrary, he killed the submission of lye, as he admitted in the case of the three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In la Caritat believes zdravotníkovým claim and do not exclude that the number of those killed may be higher than what he confessed, and justify its behaviour in the different versions which handed Vila court with the knowledge that they must change their behaviour when it became clear that he killed eight people.
Therefore, they say that they want to be justice available that was illuminated the entire range of this matter.
The European Central Bank is
Investors responded sharply yesterday on yesterday's threat from the president of the European Central Bank Trichet, who said that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to respond."
Peripheral diferenciály closed, the power of the European banks and the shares fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to err - the euro has just gone over the critical value.
That what occurred yesterday, it is typical for illiquid market, which, although the downturn, is recovering - but thanks to a short and very speculative positions.
An investor will take some time before it loses the concerns.
A month ago, the European Central Bank, she cited that today took back the level of liquidity, and tomorrow will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to buy the public debt for the ineffectiveness and eliminate all exceptional rates of liquidity within the time limit and keep unlimited access only for one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the level of liquidity projections "at least until March" and shall comply with the three month licitaci with unlimited access by the end of this session, so as to guarantee the liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue to continue its program of buying bonds and that even to notify his intensifying.
If earned will not meet the expectations, the reaction again creates markets from last night, and if they will continue to blindly continue downloading a degree of liquidity, God with us!
It was the same at the Congress in May, where they argued that not even contemplate the purchase of bonds, and the collapse of the markets - tomorrow could repeat history.
The European Central Bank must be credible and steadfast.
In May it announced armored fist on Monday and Wednesday said that they have already purchased a great deal, which caused the collapse of the market.
Yesterday's bidding notes on one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% from the previous sale.
Thus, therefore, rates in Portugal fell 30 points below, odrážejíce so a change in market sentiment, which occurred after Trichet.
In Ireland was published the numbers represent the loss of Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
Estimated the amounts are roughly 10,000 million for short term securities and other potential 15,000, in February, they have a chance to become private capital, or it will be nationalised.
While Ireland has no credibility, after the problem in July did not reveal stress tests, the amounts are in the framework of an acceptable plan, and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday will need the government to obtain the approval of the new budget of Parliament and still does not have sufficient support, so in Ireland remain a uncertainty.
Angela Merkel ease the tone of his speech, in order to ease tensions in the face for the next meeting of the leaders of the EU, held on 14 December, at which it is necessary to go for a political compromise that would show that we are a Union, and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would rather Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain had to present the Prime Minister yesterday of the possibility of an action plan, which will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions and financial institutions, the reduction in the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, the measures to stimulate employment - to the ears of investors sounds like the Four Seasons from Vivaldi.
A double effect Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market rose by 4.5%, thus doubly than other European stock exchanges.
Unlike February was the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank quick and convincing - presumably we are benefiting from the effect of a surprise.
Today, we have a key licitaci bond for three years, which will be favoured PCBs Trichet, which, we hope, for it will be a big demand, which will help to dispel the doubts about our capacity of refinancing.
Request a rescue plan would be for Spain of sacrifice.
They will give us the cash that we don't need - in the El Tesoro is available to 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - to further high rates and access to markets, we closed the sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy Cesarovy women - "not only by the criticism, but also with that zdáti."
We can do it.
The President of the Vega Sicilia Eulen huffs the firms requested his children
The storm in an open conflict in the family Álvarezových, the owners of the companies Eulen and El enebro, neutichá.
David Álvarez, a founder of the group, he will attack after he took to "completely irrelevant," the legal negotiations company El enebro planned on the 16th of this month and the required five of its seven descendants, on which they should try to force their majority and to seize with the help of the administration of the company prokury bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons of Jesús David and María José are being ironed out the legal group for a new chapter of their dispute for control of the parts of the company.
The founder of the largest holding corporate services does not seem to be willing to let up in its dispute about membership in the ruling bodies of the El enebro.
From its administration of the Committee was deposed of five of its seven descendants, who were leaders during the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, and the objection is included in the company.
The negotiations of the El enebro planned on the 16th of this month, which was convened by an official of the Commercial Court number 2 in Madrid, once again reopened Álvarezů thunder in the bosom of the family.
Apelace on the judge is to the resolution of the dispute, the only legal means which guarantees a Commission.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elviry Álvarezových Mezquirizových considers David Álvarez as "desperate means of his five children used by the ruse and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the conduct of 18 January, which was completely illegal."
This argument will serve as a basis for justification for legal challenge of this meeting as "completely meaningless."
The protagonists, who discreetly silent, has tried without success to the court convened a meeting in June.
In El enebro, a group that holds in addition to other activities of the bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven offspring of David Álvareze 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group, however, according to the family of the protocols requires exploitation right to 51% of the capital.
This issue is the key issue, which will have to decide to the judge at the trial of the issues of legal assault negotiations. Date this trial has not yet been established.
The Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with the secret weapons from Siemens
Software proposes the improvement in vehicles in real time.
Ever since the Red Bull vpadnul to show Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this exceptional world speed is characterised by surprise and success.
Initially nobody took too seriously the possibility of this new arrival of the team, and even through an upward trend in recent times, all bets were on the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonsa.
Without wishing to reduce the ability of the equestrian champion, German Sebastian Vettela, or the possibility of engine of Renault, which is driven by his car, in the world of Formula One is the stuff of legend - the "secret weapon" that multiethnic Siemens put it in the hands of the Red Bullu that it did so the winning team.
In fact, this is a powerful software simulations marches, which the German company said on the market in 2007, for the purpose of a very distant motor sport.
The PLM, this powerful software device, is used to the design of the assembly line in manufacturing plants throughout the world, in energy plants and for the instrument with a high degree of accuracy.
Its aim is faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is created in real terms, which can be avoided unnecessary mistakes and spending.
Plm facilitate the development of Camera canon, Sukhoi aircraft or the iconic brands of commercial vehicles Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this software equipment to enable the Red Bull to take place in a few hours, in almost real time "modification and improvement, which otherwise would detect during races and tests.
Russwurm says in 1992 employed the stables on average 10 technicians who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvement during one period.
In the Red Bull is working today to 180 young highly qualified professionals with an executive information technology, who will analyse and propose any type of modification of racing vehicles.
The Head of Siemens said that software PLM is able to analyse and improve all elements of racing vehicles Red Bull with the exception of the engine, which is entirely responsible for Renault.
Respectively, the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security features.
Changes, it is possible to convert the virtual reality in reality in less than 24 hours through advanced production systems by a laser and highly technologically advanced autoclave.
The only limit of this technical achievements is the amount of $40 million, representing the maximum that can each team of Formula 1 issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
The Red Bull has established around 50 km from London race high technology used to the design and production of their driving cars.
It is the two buildings, which is limited access visits - especially journalists.
What is happening here, is considered to be a "big secret."
The list of interested this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettela and Mark Webber.
A hero of Red Bullu is Formula 1 without a doubt fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
For superior technological resources that make energy drinks to put its participation in the racing circuits, however, conceal the other protagonists, whose help is invaluable, and there is no one knows.
The head of the production technology Steve Nevey claim that five years ago, it was possible to say that the progress in research and development of vehicles contribute to the victory of 50%, and the rest was due to the riders.
Currently, this ratio changed and technology behind the achievements of 85%, while the pilots contribute from 15%.
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, as it is "unpredictable Gladiators."
HP set up within two years, 20 of its own deals in cooperation with local distributors
When Hewlett Packard (HP), in cooperation with its trading partner Pont Reyes yesterday formally opened his first exclusive store in Barcelona.
This undertaking will be the first of a network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2, which this multinational company in Spain plans to open in the next two years.
These shops will be placed in 16 existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
The Spanish vice president HP Helena Herrera said as an example of a new shop přestavěnou on the Barcelona Gran Vía, belonging company Pont Reyes, with which HP cooperates for 30 years.
North American company had a plan to set up a 200 sales jobs in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), the trade in Barcelona, then, is the third.
Herrera won't say where they will be open to other outlets, however, admitted that Madrid could be one of the following points.
Herrera, who is also staff systems of HP, sure that philosophy opening shops will still be the same - with the use of local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
North American company here advises with exclusive design equipment stores (with the products, which is possible to interactively test), which will be identical in Europe.
Besides the HP addresses also ensuring the staff for business.
Helena Herrera denied that, if it were the franchising, and stressed that an exclusive network of stores is to "improve customer service, service to small and medium sized enterprises in the purchase, the operator, after sales service and even the packaging."
Trade in Barcelona is part of a pilot programme pioneer stock at world level, which aims to address any problems with the computer equipment in the guarantee.

Sabadell is betting on the fact that the "steal" during the three years of its competitors million clients
More optimistic than other bosses, delegated member of the Board of the Bank of the Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that the year 2011, it will be difficult for the bank, but it refuses a new liquidity crisis and passive predicts the end of the war.
Yet is a reduction in interest rates, but they will try to compensate slevněním bank charges and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects that he will be able to get a million during the three years of private clients.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years, and can so survive in the difficult economic conditions.
Bank runs in 2011, a new strategic plan with a term of three years.
The goal is, in addition to the survival without recourse to the public aid in the Frob, to gain market share podchycením million new private clients - or 700.000, deducted if those who, if necessary, the bank has left - because until now Ai institute rather care for small and medium sized businesses and large enterprises than small clients.
This year already acquired bank 250.000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its share of the market is, in the case of private clients 3.5%, while for corporate customers is that more than 10%.
Another of the fundamental ideas of the 2011 to 2013 is a commitment to the productivity, or you can say also sobriety, with the aim of reducing costs, whose challenges will show the bank, when it will present the results for the period.
Few banking institutions are at this time will not dare to set targets and to publish it, as the financial crisis has changed all plans of world banking.
Sabadell this year closes its programme Optima, set out four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the situation on the markets require the extension for a further period.
Clients who leave from savings banks, will be the main target group.
At a meeting convened by Apie insisted Guardiola that 2011 will be "hard and very important."
Indeed, he believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain "will be long and protracted."
In addition, it will be in two or three years, "very difficult to create employment, which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although they believe that the passive war - which reduces the margin - is retreating, price increases for the risk that banks and thrifts pay for their emissions, to obtain liquidity, is already shifting to the price of loans, thereby offsetting the reduction in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor of duress on credit."
"We conclude the trigger, but diferenciály are very high," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto already gave its network on Thursday orders, to be reduced long term loans and increased prices diferenciálů - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
Also recognized that the trend in banking "now is the reduction of the commissions," but here is "competitive framework."
The strategic plan banks Sabadell is based on an organic growth, but as usual group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not for nothing assures that, in Spain "will require greater size."
"The next year will not remain on the rock stone," he assured.
Confirms that the needs of the capital are "very limited" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will enter between red numbers.
And it highlights that the Frob can replace the collection of the funds on the market before the new measure of capital.
After the assurance that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, remains a serious problem of what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
Notes that cannot issue, but unlike what it was in June, it is possible to obtain financing in the short term through repo rate, which moderates the crisis.
Ceca excludes another wave of mergers thrifts
General Director CECA refused yesterday that it should be another wave of mergers, and once again insisted on the speed with which the reorganisation of the sector.
When the association started the process of the Spanish savings banks, was a number of institutions that assured that this first phase will not attend and wait for the second round.
However, the General Director of the Spanish Confederation of thrifts (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday ruled out that there should be a new wave of these operations.
"I believe that the majority of the merger has already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasolu into of the Banca Cívica cannot be considered as the second round, what is happening, they are of the convention."
"The majority is completely made; it is possible that, instead of 17 institutions will go to 13 or 14, but all great processes are already ready and under the protection of the National Bank of Spain, which in this matter has worked very well," said the director.
In their statements at a meeting of the Association (ADEA managers and executive officials of Aragon EIRGRID Olavarrieta, that the concentration of the process shall be "maximum speed, and we must be very satisfied, as shown in instalments, which, at the time, not now, appeared in commercial plans are Španělskou National Bank," he stressed.
"Go from 45 thrifts with average volume of assets built million to 17 million 75.500 is a process which has in the history of the comparison, the number of institutions so redukujíce about 62% that these were larger, and thus, in accordance with the Basel agreement," underline that point.
Olavarrieta recognised that "there are a number of views of the less fortunate to the slowness of the process," which show "lack of seriousness and understanding" because, "what does the Spanish National Bank is a reminder that we must be before the end of the year, in the term."
General Director CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain has the strictest financial system across Europe and "probably" and in the world, and those who call into question, at the "lack of knowledge."
The director observed that, in the current favourable economic situation "can be calm" on the financial institutions and savings banks and the system, which made the "very important" process of concentration, which continues "the highest possible speed."
It also reminded that the Spanish banking worked very well from the stress tests conducted by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the red line German
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
The tension on the markets of a dual government response.
On the one hand, he suggested José Luis Zapatero new adaptation measures, from a reduction in taxes for small and medium sized enterprises, through the regulation of private agencies or the abolition of 426 euro for unemployed people without benefits, after the privatisation of 49% (AENA Španělských airports and air traffic control -!), the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the national lottery.
Vice Elena Salgadová with the support of the former Prime Minister Felipe González, on the other hand, connected to the critiques on the Chancellor Angela Merkel because of its responsibility for starting the current crisis.
How to interpret this emotion?
Be told in advance that the opinion of the Merkel is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in a complex process redefinice of the euro.
And here, Germany has had a radically new vision about what it is to be his future, which is hitting the idea of respect for the old traditions, which holds a large part of the other members.
In the face of European resistance in Germany begins to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first one is a strong euro area, which would be just Germany, but also, for example, Austria and the Netherlands, while the southern States would be monetary zone have left.
The other is the return to the mark - although now it may seem like science-fiction, this version has broad public support, close to 50% of the population.
The third option is under German proposals for the revision of the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary austerity, fines for offending states, potential delays in payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible costs on the regulation of the private sector.
Germany's position is clear and already with some time defines, so now there is no room for prevarication.
First, though in 2009, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encourage deficits, pulled out of the sleeve of the German government of a constitutional reform, to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of contradiction between what was seen Germany for the right (plans and fiscal stringency of the stability of public finances), and by what they were its European partners, including France.
The second showed this central European country, when Merkel painfully drew the decision on the rescue of Greece.
Already at that time was the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany, and public opinion, which was also published, have been strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel appeared again with a clear opinion, if required to reform of the European Union, in order to allow for the preservation of a Member State, and at the same time, in order to have the private creditors to bear part of the cost.
This opinion was interpreted as the opposite of Europe, since the pace of the Irish crisis and everything else.
But the proposal, although in somewhat as mitigated form, was approved, and during the next few months, we should monitor the process of reform of the Union, which should from 2013 to allow these measures.
Germany set a red line, which is not going to exceed.
And all tells us that, although it is now necessary to make measures that we too may not agree, since this time will be the end of the operation of the euro.
The year 2013 will represent the birth of a new monetary zone, in which they will be severely penalised and the offending states may be forced to announce the postponement of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the cost.
Germany shows us that we need to give a strict way of growth with an increase in the level of savings and investment, moderate consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, which ruled in the years of the boom growth of Spain, simply will not tolerate.
Offer is clear.
And we would be making a mistake if we do it.
It is not only about the restoration of the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do, it is much harder.
And the worst thing is that, under these conditions, we could become that they would.
I hope that the current turbulence will be replaced by peace.
And that we will use the opportunity that they give us in the spring of 2013.
It appears that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood and his dual statements (the reforms promised after the meeting with large enterprises from last Saturday, and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel opened the way the idea that it is necessary to make things right.
But the red line, which Germany set itself, that is, and does not seem to want to move.
And of the options, which can be considered, could not leave the euro area full not very serious countries exclude.
Well, Germany, we will always be able to say that us warned.
Sport and the circumvention of the rules
Tricks, they've shown Alonso and Ramos in the struggle with Ajaxem, show ingenuity not the intention to escape punishment.
A supposedly contrived the exclusion of two players Realu Madrid (Xabiho Alonsa and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League game against Ajax of 23 November has caused that it was dumped into the sea of ink on whether or not this is unsportsmanlike conduct, and whether both footballers DIČ UEFA should not be punished.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which had their team clearly vyhraný) appointed by the players, one after the other deliberately losing time at a moment when he had to play a foul, to provoke the ref, and he showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, the two players will meet the prescribed punishment in the following match against Auxerre - and Real Madrid will end in his group in the forefront - and will be able, deprived of cards, to go on to the next phase.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of UEFA José red Mourinhovi punishment for two games and errant players got a financial penalty.
The provocation of yellow cards for similar conditions is not a new practice, but it is more or less normal in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football rules, which are informal, but they watch.
Part of the discussion in this case by the fact that the party was a team of Real Madrid (which is in his own anthem, boasting of magnanimity and honour, and which already has fined for similar acts of its player), and as it seems, also thanks of supervised Mourinhem, which so adds to its long history, the comedian and provocateur another episode.
In any event, the debate revolves around whether this type of action, which is not the rules explicitly forbidden, is contrary to the principles of the sport, whether in these deeds of circumvention of the law; it is, in fact, the actions which respect sporting rules, whose sense, however, it seems, is trying to do.
With, what type of damage such negotiations are active sporting spirit.
One of the elements of the sporting behavior is the physical integrity of the air, which was not in such cases violated, or the violent game.
Another one of these elements that characterise a clean game is to avoid the players through their offence against the other team should have an advantage - and here too.
Thus paradoxical at action players Realu Madrid is the fact that this did not happen, what normally charakterizujeme as a ruse or circumvention of the law, not the hidden rules in order to avoid a penalty, but this behaviour should be seen as much as possible in order to receive the penalty.
They waited and like the punishment.
Another question, however, is what advantage culprits from his deliberate offence will have.
Here, it is important to note that an opponent lacking in a disadvantaged position, and that, in the current struggle can't get any benefit, as an obvious consequence is that the team will have fewer players.
And it's not even a useful strategy into another battle, because the club will not be able to count on with these players.
Advantage clearly lies in the fact that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could endanger their participation in the future of the game.
However, this is an advantage in the long term, and with a certain degree of uncertainty, that is, at first glance, it may be the team has been eliminated, and this process will have players of punishment, and they go into the second round of the cards in which to the exclusion of just on one card less than in the first round.
So how will be wheels continue, it is not entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations go against the spirit of sports, whose part is to make strategic decisions, which will make it possible to obtain the maximum benefit in the framework of the rules.
In the case, which we are dealing with here, not the players to avoid the penalty (which would be a clear case of circumventing the rules), but rather to choose when to obey him.
Made a strategic decision without avoiding the punishment or fled before him.
Although there is no line between wit and circumvention quite clear, I believe that in this case is clearly a wit.
It seems to me that there is a controversy for two reasons: Because it was about two samovyloučení and because of the way in place transfer instructions to the provocation from the leadership.
Damage sporting principles of these actions is not so ethical as aesthetic.
The fight offers on the organisation of Christmas parties in Barcelona
Calendar dictates of this year is concentrated an avalanche reservations on 16 and 17 December.
Quickly mount celebrations paid by the employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 of the euro.
As well as the Turkish honey or lottery, come again with the arrival of the December Christmas parties, which still serves as the oxygen bottle for the restaurant and the device for free time in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis have resulted in the fight to obtain a client by lowering the price: Almost everyone wants for the food to spend 20 to 30 of the euro, they agree interviewed entrepreneurs and the association of this sector.
To complete the number of complication steeled himself this calendar year (when Christmas Day fell on a Friday) applications for the week of December 13, which was created a flurry of bookings on days in the rush hour (16 and 17.), while in the previous week there was almost no traffic.
As has happened since the year 2008, which began to lean years, it is the many firms that collective parties have abolished for budgetary reasons.
That they didn't leave tradition, many employees pay the piper at parties from their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, and many are demanding prices on the edge of viability, says the president of the association of restaurants de Gremi Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
Representative patronátu restaurant equipment at this moment does not dare to predict what will be the celebration of this month.
"Good people to think twice before they make a reservation."
"They want to go, but when it comes to the subject of prices, they are cautious," he adds.
Those shops will go well, "which offer quality and good service at a reasonable price," he says, and recalls that, thanks to the crisis, consumers have tended to go a step down, and the majority of the customer wants to spend now around 25 euro.
Survey in various facilities shows that the brunt of applications for a reservation is on the night of December 17.
Group Soteras reports real boom reservations on this Friday, with most of the requirements is within 30 at the expense of the euro, which they offered the menu, the overall price is from 25 to 30 of the euro.
In other major companies, which is Andilana, of 16 equipment in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and other), brought the peculiarity of this calendar, more early reserves, and that since the beginning of November.
"We made possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menu from which you should select each range from 1 9.95 to 30 euro," state.
AN Grup in the group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 businesses, remain optimistic after they have seen from the second half of the increase in profits and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
Resources of this company stress that also 18 December will vytíženým on the day, as it will take place before Christmas celebrations among friends.
For their six group menu added Christmas menu, with a budget of 30 euro or more, as seen in comparison with the previous year to the tendency of the guests to spend 10% more in exchange for the other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine -!).
Also note that there are already firms that once again invite their employees, and it seems that size groups is slightly larger.
(Fecasarm vice president of the company that includes institutions such as the Association of bars, restaurants, and centres of free time in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes it is beginning to see the end of the tunnel, and claims that the number of reservations was "revived," even though clients "smlouvají at maximum."
This impression during the Christmas celebrations or not, whether it is true, who pays, points.
Pakistan's nuclear program has produced great unrest in the U.S.
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country."
WikiLeaks documents confirm links between talibánci and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the Embassy of the United States in Pakistan and the US, published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary anxiety, which in Washington raises Pakistan's nuclear program.
Beside objasňujících and important details that offer on the content of the communication and the ideas of the North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that the cooperation between the two countries, when it comes to nuclear safety, instead of the increases, "is on the wane," and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state."
A peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that his weapons are assembled, but stored after works to their destruction was made more difficult in the case of the attack - is one of the main reasons for the vigilance of Washington.
This is calculated Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson in a report before the visit of the then National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some of the nuclear facilities in the territory under the control of the Taliban, the spread of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transport of nuclear materials.
An increase in the number of persons associated with nuclear arsenály and with the missile has already observed, it is not only the US, but also of Russia, as a widening and representing a reason to be wary.
"Pakistan had to protect the nuclear device to hire staff with a strict religious faith; due to the decline of the level of education and culture have extremist organisations more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or missile programmes," said the expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with their counterparts from the US.
The greatest innovation of the dossier published by Juliana Assangeho is increasingly less cooperation between the US and Pakistan on issues of nuclear proliferation and the increased rate of Pakistani production of these weapons.
Trap issued by an embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as a "frustrating," says: "There is often no transparency; offer assistance remain unpunished or are rejected."
In another report notes Peter Lavoy, worker of national intelligence services for South Asia that "despite the economic disaster produces the Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country in the world."
Ambassador Pettersonová also asks Washington that during the visit, the chief of the army general Ashfaqa Kayaniho, "very clear" that "the Pakistani military must end with the silent support for terrorist groups."
Hunt on the boss of the Wikileaks
Obama named senior officer responsible for the fight against terrorism, to avoid evasion of the new information.
Interpol issued a "red call" in order to trace and identify where Assange could be.
Everything on the Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assangeho form complicated labyrinth, where it is hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol said yesterday "extraordinary challenge," the so called red notice, to "locate the and monitoring of movement" Assangeho.
But this is not a classic command of the detention.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it dates back to the 20th November.
And he has nothing to do with the recent release of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse, which the Australian faces in Sweden.
Alongside that assures the legal representative of the Wikileaks Mark Stephens that "the police know where and how to contact with Mr Assangem."
It was November 20, when the chorus of international police, located in the French Lyon issued this statement at the request of Sweden, by originating institution, however, until yesterday, when it has received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation has 188 countries, Interpol instructions to identify or locate Assangeho "with the aim to impose on him a temporary custody and hand him."
Although Interpol can order the arrest of the person, which concerns the red challenge, many member states, as the organisation explained, however, consider the so called red notice for allowing the arrest of conduct - it must be ensured a national component of the police - especially in the case where countries are mutual agreement on the issue of detainees, as is the case in Sweden and England, which would probably have Assange be.
This step its sales fell Assengeho lawyers, who yesterday published writing, where the claim that competent WikiLeaks founder willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities via video conference.
Recall also that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the Prosecutor of your case, which compare with the legendary Lavrentijem Pavlovitch Berijou, Stalin's head of security.
"This is the hunt and no legal persecution," the letter.
While it is looking for the whole world - and Australia with his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange is on to an unknown place, but nemlčí.
Monday has provided via Skype from an unknown place interview editor Time magazine - in this interview called for the demise of the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it proves that it was responsible for an order for the US to conduct espionage in the UN and so broke international Convention, which the United States signed, she should resign," he said.
His view was rejected by the White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, which qualify for the requirement or her resignation as a "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not quite sure why you should care about the opinion individuals, which has a website," he said on CNN.
Obama himself was very senior official responsible for the fight against terrorism, Traverse Rusella to prevent the next evasion of documents.
The intention spokesman of President Barack Obama to stop adding Assangemu on the importance of the contrasts with the views, which these days are conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, a member of Congress, who will chair the Committee since January for the national security in the chamber, asked the State Department to look into the possibility of including Wikileaks between the terrorist organisation, "in order to intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance."
Even further up Tom Flanagan, the manager of the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said that Assange should "be killed," which subsequently had to appeal.
"Obama would be on him should dump a reward or use unmanned aircraft or something like that."
Who haven't apologized, was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, a former Arkansas guvernátor and possible candidate for president.
"Everyone will be in the government, the man who is responsible for the leak, has committed treason and any other punishment than the execution would be too modest," he said at the station Fox
Puigcercós is looking for in the ERC easy "twinkle" on supporters Caroda
Republican leader will allow the side of the secret vote on their survival.
Huguet proposes more plurální schůzovního executive and the end of the system.
Joan Puigcercós apparently found the recipe, how to fight already advised internal rebellion in the ranks of the Republican Party of Catalonia (ERC Levicová EIRGRID, bezvýslednou because of the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
President of the Party is aware that his gesture on the demise seems to be supporters of the former leader of Josep Lluíse Caroda-Roviry insufficient, and also knows that the influence of this sector is now already weakened as its leader, and that he absolutely cannot do such concerns, as he had with other living streams.
Therefore, it will be the leader of the Left to try to get the new criticism using served, which will help him to compose herself to the municipal elections.
First Puigcercós said yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee will be able to express in secret to his remaining in office.
Using the ballots, not by a show of hands.
If they want supporters Caroda to the President of a voice, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, wants to avoid a split and subjugate the boss of its people.
In several interviews, claimed that he did not consider it would be endorsed with half of the vote and one, moreover, but he added, without clarified percent, it would also not be a good result "after bulharsku."
Supporters Caroda demand after the President more than he gave its function available - which they consider to be a gesture, which has no weight as Puigcercós and controls on the authority.
But, given that they do not have a sufficient majority, so that they can enforce his or her resignation, they will seek to remind the executive plan from now until May.
Because they expect that they should participate in the drafting of the document on the strategic reorientation, which will give the management of the national Board vote the 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to promote Puigcercóse in exchange for this promise has already moved Congress in the autumn of 2011.
The leader of the ERC said that "mnohohlasnost" harms stability, and that its aim is that, once and for all the organization was able to fight their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context seems to be a typical article that the current advisor, Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After he took into consideration Puigcercósův ideologue, this adviser for innovation he took for granted that the leader will be confirmed "in exchange for a few goals.
And the name of five, two of which are outstanding.
The first is "překomponování" of the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which means also include the new faces, who are friendly Carodovi from the sector.
The second objective may be a great innovation.
Huguet proposes that ERC completely end schůzovnictvím as a mechanism of the functioning.
And that fights for reform of the constitution, in order to take place congresses through delegates selected by a vote.
Put an end to the model schůzovního system, the exemption in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended aim Puigcercósova team in this regard already fought and for the last two.
However, the full Assembly in 2008, decided that schůzovnictví must be considered at a special congress on the reform of the constitution.
This matter is still pending, as the situation within the Party dissuaded from a solution to this matter.
Now, without lurking critical sectors, could be a good time again to address this issue and to try to close it once and for all.

Obama promotes the law on Twitter in support of students without documents
"Think that approval of the law of the Dream Act is right, get to know your senators and naléhej that this law approved" tweetoval the American president on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama is today the contribution on his personal account social network Twitter joined the national mobilization in support of the law of the Dream Act, which would legalise the students without documents.
"Think that approval of the law of the Dream Act is right, I want to know your senators and naléhej that this law approved" tweetoval Obama.
His short report highlights the Internet link to more comprehensive document, which calls for the public to be immediately contacted senators, since the vote on this act is coming.
"Since it is expected that the vote will take place soon, now is the time to make your opinion," points.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators been threatened by blocking any approval of the law, if it is not approved by the extension of the tax cuts from the Bush era and the funding of the government.
Such blocking, which was notified by a letter signed 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote on the Testament Dream Act and on other projects, such as the ratification of the new treaty with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons, called START.
When he was asked about the Republican blocking law Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman, has said that he believes that it will be resolved as soon as the fiscal topic, it will be possible to draw up a schedule for the rest of the projects.
"I believe that there is still a lot of time."
"We all agree that we need to resolve the issue of taxes before the end of the year..."
I believe that we are in a particular moment to reach an agreement on this point, and then we will be able to plan the order of other issues, "he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that it will demand a "vote on the conclusion of the discussion" on the law of the Dream Act, so it is about the proposal to legalise the students without documents could have in the Senate vote from next Thursday, although it is more likely next week.
Senator's approval of the Dream Act, or the law of "the American dream" would legitimise roughly 800 thousand young people who got into the United States before they reached 16 years, have resided in the country during the last five years, and have been admitted to the institution of higher education or into the army.
However supporters need 60 votes for approval of the proposal, which is why they need the help of a few Republicans, so that the organisation of his supporters carried out an intensive agitation, in order to ensure the approval of this law.
Democrats, the majority of the Dream Act supports, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has stated that he will vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, to express my support for this law.
Because the supporters of the project Dream Act they need to get a few Republicans in the event that other democrats have decided to reject the proposal.
Between the Republican Senators, with whom most supporters are negotiating, the Senator from Maine Olympia Snoweová and Susan Colinsová, as the outgoing senator from Florida George Lemieux, who said the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who, in the past, supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchisonová from Texas, but they said that the next time it will no longer support.
Another Republican, who supported the proposal, John Mccain, in this moment.
Although the House of Representatives is sympathetic to the other version, according to the majority of analysts Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With the literature of the finger into the wound ("el poner grandfather en la llaga" translated "insert a finger into the wound" is the equivalent of the English "- to hit the nail on the head!)
The second round of the cycle of the pleasure of the language was the boardwalk where participants have literary gala
"Sexem in a language I understand, but... finger, they're into the wound? What is expected of me?" She asked a writer Luisa Valenzuelová, which was invited to open the second round of pleasure from the language of the cycle, which is celebrating the literature written in the Spanish language, and the question was used on this occasion, as the subtitle of (at another fair with the round table devoted to the subject of Sex in the language, she said).
The finger into the wound "brings us into a corner," she said sweetly Argentine writer to the audience, made up of predominantly young people, which had gathered at the book fair in Guadalajara that you listened to this debate for a round table, and with the participation of Marisol Moderated Schultz Valenzuelové, Sergio Ramírez, Mayry Monterové and Luis García Montera.
Luisa Valenzuelová read the text, which devoted Gonzalu Celoriovi, and Schultz called then for a great story in which she performed Luisa in the first person as protagonistka that in the search for knowledge, what's "morning" going from doctor to doctor, from which it does not answer though traces of the same story.
Since leaving infektologa convinced: "Patience is not my strong suit, it may be my morning."
Eventually, after the frustration with traumatologem who took her breath in the middle of the road, but he explained that morning is not a scientific term, is that analyst, which reveals the secret: "Morning represents a truly open, and it is a symbolic scar."
You protagonistka odlehčeně sighed and concluded that "on the wound, she managed to learn is that it is really open, and that there is no," but its view that the pleasure, and the dangers in the language must go hand in hand.
A writer Valenzuelová played with both.
Nikaragujec Sergio Ramírez also stepped with an adorable story, which he called the praise of invention, in which there is no finger on the wound appointed, but in one moment will appear.
With the elements of the magical realism tells of the witch who played the clouds, back the people who have gone far, or repair chastity, which lost one virgin, this narrative, which then turned to talk America, a great novel in which horses from the beginning of his own historian, who told him, and it is cited here Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticises exaggeration in the story any captains.
"Cervantes, which all of us (writer) invented, the derided fingovaným testimony, which was in the stories presented as real, but in a different way is never failed to tell the story of America with such imagination, which lacked even shame."
However, stress, "they are fools and liars who have greater imagination" and just where it mixes fact and a lie, where he doesn't know what the story belongs to one of the group, and in the second, reaching dummy literature of its peak.
It is called a "cervantovskou tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy we have, what we have."
Subsequently Mayra Monterová stress and praise the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair, with his finger, they're into the wound besedou allowed.
Kubánsko-portorická writer pointed the finger at a great blow of social violence, which is going through its country - and shares her Latin America - and it is the result of a trade dispute and the sale of drugs.
"I think that the good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a compromise, which is not, of course, intended," she said, after it said that the reality of the literature is communications and dimensions of a compromise between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction."
Evening closed Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose speech also placed the emphasis "on the finger into the wound writer a tied a writer."
He said that in the world, who lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and control of consciousness, which is teeming with dogmatismy, forgotten it, "that for every přitakáním is small, and not too small for each is a negation of" Yes ."
"We were masters of our ideas and the reality we must at spin control: And at spin control means so much paste finger into the wound and bother those individuals who are much more comfortable, since minds in editorial, in black and white, in the fixed ideas and no colour, and trouble also the authority which prefer this black and white world," he said, in order to support the use of writing.
Romano is for their first title

Rubén already lost two finals against "Red devils" from Toluky and one against Monterrey, letting his future, therefore, would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of a curse, and for the first time, he would celebrate the title, although he says that, for him, is the most important institution.
"I want to go out a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I am obliged, and the title would, of course, and for me, but the first one is the most important," said the coach, when he was asked about the numbers, which he speaks in the finals against him.
In living memory has the previous finals, in which, as confirmed, many taught, "we carried the lessons that the arbitration nezapíská until the end, we can't celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as players, because the last time with two penaltami, we were ready to go out to celebrate, and I think that in this we have learned until the game is over, we cannot celebrate."
It is not concerned, that this series could decide in criminal stříleních, believes his players: "I will not be a series of kicks, you're trying to end in the normal time, but sometimes there is no other way, and it is necessary to be ready for it, in the last tournament, we are prepared to have, unfortunately, but the fate of us put together a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt, when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, it was left in us and let us hope that this time something of this sort will not happen."
Romano has a chance to be in the hands of the other and a taste of the glory for the first time, they bring with titles.

Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
Bill of conservatives who, according to the government should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will be clearly overcome, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday, stated that it cannot support.
A significant degree "I am basing myself on the Charter."
"I stand upright on the side of the party, which was built by the granite beneath your feet," said the head of the Liberal Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after the weekly meeting of the week of the caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as is proposed, a law that would allow people to hold up to one year any person coming from the ship, identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian charter of rights and freedoms.
The head of Quebec Tier, Gilles Duceppe, also said that he could not support the bill, because it is going to the wrong target.

The government especially the vote of confidence for its bill, which could lead to the election of the country leading to its rejection.
One conservative yet QMI Agency said that the government will ask for the vote that each Member who is against, the answer from his position before their voters.
The new unity does not unanimity
Despite the notice on the possible creation of a permanent unit for the fight against corruption and a collusive action, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry committee for the issue.
The minister for public security, Robert Dutil, seeks to this idea didn't fit into oblivion: Québec intends with the Department of Investigation from New York address this issue already in January of next year.
The metropolis has a constant anti corruption unit since 1870.
Because Tuesday's notification many of us by surprise.
It is to be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Council for the police service in Quebec 29 October last year, it was not discussed this measure, despite the fact that he was also present himself Robert Dutil.
There was no need for the critic of public security, straník PQ Stéphane Bergeron, rate the announcement as "rabbit extended out of a hat" and "amateur solutions zfušované on the knee."
Minister Dutil said to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"Are content with the confirmation: You will see the result, and we'll work it out."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjeana Parenta, nothing can replace the establishment of the hearing of witnesses in a public trial.
"Moreover, Mr Charest strengthens the case in that it does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think like you and I that he was hiding something," he says.
"The only way to achieve the creation of a commission of inquiry, is the demise of Jean Charesta," explained in the case of Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the training of senior officials.
In order to come out of this impasse, suggested of Quebec to grant special authority of the Inspector General to investigate a collusive action and corruption.
"We need to be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he said.
Also considers that Quebec might give the inspector the same powers as Commissioner, which allow you to force people to testify.
The creation of the working group is not the only proposal in the writings Charestovy government.
Quebec would also after the Ottawa, changing the Criminal Code, so that he was better suited for this type of crime.
This requirement would have emerged from the agent for operation Marteau (Hammer), which disclosed Justice Minister Jean Marc Fournier, the case law for this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal minister for public security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, had just dealt with certain amendments connected with this document.

DuPont blamoval in
A Quebec radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial failure before the Canadian Council for the standard radio and television broadcasting (RRTV) because of controversial statements on social assistance and the Haitians and, as well as due to gross of expression during the broadcast.
Council for radio and television broadcasting considers that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and undue negative presentation Haitians gross expression that does not match the broadcasting seconded during the day."
Council also concluded that the discussion about suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two people who took life, do not breach the rules for radio broadcasts.
Council for radio and television broadcasting has received a number of complaints relating to comments made during the broadcast, carried by between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after the complaint of the Common Front of recipients of social support of Quebec.
The group complained that the amount in the air, were inaccurate.
Moderators must present reliable information, not false.
As for suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont thought that suicide is a gesture of despair.
The majority of the members of the Commission concluded that the report was that suicide cannot be seen as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission considers that the contentious episodes of broadcast" Dupontových Ishmale reports "crashed on a delicate topic by an impartial and appropriate manner."
Against him was not raised no rebuke.
The last dispute concerned the statement that followed after the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean René Dufort, therefore, put into the media fire, which has given rise to many reactions.
Moderator CHOI said that sent no gift to help Haitians now, because we cannot know for sure that the necessary money actually get.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates the unduly negative image of Haitians.
"I make up for my three days of delay this thing."
"My file is intact already one and a half years," said the host.
In all decision of the Commission refuses to use in the broadcasting of gross expression.
In any case, if the FM radio broadcasts CHOI cooperated "beyond their duties."
For the station, which will have to notify, among other things, this decision once in the course of the main broadcasting within three days, the consequences are minimal.
The king of Kung fuvà Montreal.
Population of the Montreal, originating in Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely odd hop.
An athlete, which is highlighted in "Sandě" (kung fu "full contact"), in kickboxu and the Thai boxing shall enter on the tatami and ringy around the world and is looking for new challenges.
"I began with by martial science as kung fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, he explained Zemmal that nymí lives in the capital city since 2008, learning to the professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches a little bit everywhere, because for those who do not like the game in the country, which appears in the combat sports, are a competition in North America rare."
Recently this person, who works as a security and as an assistant for company UPS just added its opponents bad news, when he won two gold medals at the World Cup, World Karate and kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edimburgu, in Scotland.
"I won the category kickboxu full contact and Thai boxing, he said."
"At the present time, preparing to China to the World Cup in the san shou."
"They were invited rivals who finished the first four at the last world championship in each category."
"In Toronto in 2009, I won bronze."
"In 2005 in Vietnam, I finished the eighth."
"In 2007 in China, I ended up in the tournament in the fifth bruise, while in Toronto in 2009, I finished third, he added."
"Interesting is that in every contest I achieve some progress."
"At this rate, I will be the first this year or next year!"
"San shou" or "Sands" is the discipline originating in China, where the feet and legs, as well as jettisoning to the ground, allowed.
Games are traditionally on the platform, and fewer in the ring.
The most famous fighter, resulting from this form of fight, it is an American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.

"Then the other winners of each category to be crowned the only champion, the king of kung fu."
450 contracted by million without public competitions
Hydro-Québec agreed by mutual agreement of 450 million in contracts with firms providing engineering to project hydroelektrický Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is generated by a consortium of firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and the Axor, which gained the most important contract, contract for the management of the entire project in a total of 295 million dollars without a public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of the Energy gérance in 2004 was authorised in parallel with the selection of the company Hydro-Québec that were committing to the private sector responsibility for the management of this important project hydroelektrického in $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, a consortium "Energy gérance" gained lucrative contract without any publication of a public competition.
For Quebeckou side of a complaint on a consortium of businesses in front of us is a serious problem of ethical character, which runs the risk of exclusion competition and price increases.
"It's a new way to implement a collusive action and eliminate competition."
"That means that people have not done in secret side of the agreement, it is now doing it openly," he said yesterday, a Member of the PQ Sylvain Simard at a press conference.
About something before morning, M. Simard put this question to the National Assembly, because he says upset, how can be sold to the public interest in this way.
Minister for natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau, afternoon argued vigorously popírajíc that could work for this contract on a collusive action.
"I have my own way," hromovala and claimed that the PQ was "dishonest" and "lack the precision."
She said that "it would be the least" that the PQ apologise.
A recipe for the creation of the consortium is normal practice in the world.
It is usually an alliance, limited in time to allow two or more businesses to group their mutual expertisy, so that they can respond to the call for tenders on a comprehensive project.
Project Eastmain is very complicated with regard to obsáhlost work.
The construction is already running and must be phased by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without the competition could act; it was a trade.
It is also necessary to admit that a story of consortia in Quebec is no longer the exception, and even for the relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week, Le Devoir, a story of consortia in the advice in engineeringu is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If přelétneme in the speed of commercial register quebeckých firms, that will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be made permanent.
This company Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its major competitors; let us name + CIMA, Génivar, ES-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is the Dessau.
If the consortium Energy gérance, Minister Normandeauová particularly highlighted the fact that "the territory of the Baie James is typical special dynamism of the work force, and that when it reacts Hydro Québec since the 1970s."
Main patron of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, from Energy companies Baie James (SEBJ), he gave the explanation that will force us svraštit forehead at the fact that the contract on the management of the project has been reached by mutual agreement.
"If you go into a public competition, and if a few participants in the competition, making an offer, your push prices may be higher."
"You have a choice of two options: I.e. can summon the people who appear in the contract as participants in the competition, and that you say:" Let's make a deal with a satisfactory and a good price. "
"But the main idea is that the price is not important, but the responsibility of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
This treaty granted to a consortium of Energy gérance is part of a long list of agreements for more than $50,000, which received the Party of Quebec.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ on the project if the Eastmain 1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification Le Devoir counted 109 contracts for advice in the field engineeringu, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with firms or their branches, particularly with the laboratories, implementing the analysis of samples of the soil.
Snc-Lavalin grabbed 22 contracts, Génivar of them gained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without a stake in the "Energy gérance."
All contracts were concluded.
Together amount to $449 783 344, including a contract with Energy gérance 295 to $131 564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and the Axor) are "very good friends of the Liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister Normandeauová released a report that the PQ is also associated with firms, "finance," before he said that this is more about her management staff.
The barometer of responsible consumption - the "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
A Quebec consumer is very little trust the actors of sustainable development, but also "impartial" brands and environmental certificate, to be to drive in the selection of products.
The worst thing is that even if the koupeme in the media space, which urges us and recommends a socially responsible consumption, wailing this media space over a lack of credible information, the failure to comply with the obligations which qualifies even as a brake for their commitment, states Baromètre responsible consumption, the first article was published yesterday.
Even if the increased consumption in 2010, for example of socially responsible products, the people of Quebec, who are trying to sell them, they nevertheless too believes
Two thirds of us, in fact, they say that they don't believe the promises of firms, concerning the environment, just because green advertising companies, checks for measuring instrument, which has produced a responsible consumption up an observatory at the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: Half of consumers doubts on the credibility of the official certificate, for example on přikládaných fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands, which are designated as environmentally responsible, states Barometre.
Politicians, in the same way, the debate on this subject is taken as a serious only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
Information about responsible consumption, however, seems to be of paramount for stimulation of this page of consumption of the activity in the present time quebeckých almost a third of the consumer.
Indeed, a vacuum and dubious character of the information would alleviate the enthusiasm 46% of consumers.
That is the second brake, that he identified Baromètre, after higher prices for these products.
After all, a third of the population puts Quebekuse suspiciously towards frequent data on products or "green" services, which we seek to let them go through our hands.
On the other hand, in the year of 2010 was almost half of consumers willing to change their habits, and particularly to change the brand of one or more of the products, thereby respond to their beliefs.
For 61% of them favoring purchases at traders in their area and prefer the purchase of food, grown in their region, states Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 from the maximum 100 for this year - Homo consumus Québeku like presented as the king of recycling, which seeks the lowest possible impact on the environment by the old on the protection of animals.
But their social and ecological conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their car states Baromètre: In 2010, only 28% of the population of Quebec said that the use of public transport, or that they recommend the use of the car to travel at least two people, in the interests of the protection of nature.
Walk and bike also supported on's 1 02.5% of the participants of this extensive survey behavior, who used this cliché.
The loan of the state to buy the complex cinemas eXcentris
The government of Quebec, which we have asked for financial participation to buy complex cinemas eXcentris Society Angus and towards, agrees with the sentiment, but only up to the amount of the loan.
Developperská society "Angus et le, towards," which sought a gift in the amount of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture on the redemption of cinematic complex on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, which has demonstrated its mission as a lover of the arts, has not received it, as required.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the dossier, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift proposes the government of Quebec a loan, which would have been less, some was the original expectations, which could build a basis for a viable solution for favourable conditions and resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and the requirement to 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the applications have already been revised on the reduction.
The proposal for a plan of action and sent Secretary St Pierre if the president of the Society for the development of business in culture (SODEC), François Macerola, which controls film project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the counterclaim government came into society SODEC on Tuesday.
Towards Le and Angus have time until 31 December to respond.
However, it appears that the hypothesis of the gift from the state must really be rejected.
Let us recall that the Association of cinema owners and cinematographic centres in Quebec, was set against a direct investment of the state, in order to support the redemption eXcentrisu, usuzujíc that the culture minister does not have to fund the project on the real estate, as it has done for other kinosály.
But a number of participants in the debate, on the contrary, the fundamental dožadovalo economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, was in the area of its cinemas in ten years of film art, after himself finance the construction of the complex, which could be the reason for the amendment of the financial advice of the state.
The lack of meeting rooms for independent films is stark in Montréalu, and eXcentris could get a permanent clientele.
The company Angus and towards, with Christian Yaccarini in his forehead, governed by the campaign for the release of funds to the private sector, in the belief that coming up $700 000 to push the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, the only one of three film companies, towards Le, continues in the distribution of films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is opened again all three rooms on 27 February of next year, and project the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini remind Le Devoir and then ignored, so he and his group thinks about the proposals to shrink, which are made to him.
Swollen by the curtain on Canada as a whole.
The new diplomatic American sources listed known by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States regarded as an inferiority complex Canadians against the Americans, but in the same stroke reveal their sense of superiority of the latter against Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprising that, on any Canadian voters lies at the heart of Canadian / American relations, when it comes to vote, and they believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the conservative government to ensure that its budget was adopted in 2009!
Four new reports which were between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday landed to wonder at the public, provide extra sensitive details to get each other "under the skin."
Communication with the date of September 22, 2008, i.e., in the middle of an election campaign, stated in detail at what point the United States is not part of the bets of political leaders.
To the surprise, the U.S. Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides for this situation a few explanations.
"Canadian inferiority complex, almost lingering, makes possible political leaders to talk about the internal fix, instead, to realise that these elections are also relevant to the United States (as in the campaign for free trade in 1988)," he writes.
"The United States," he concluded, "the elephant in this election: The ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk."
Ambassador means this "instant silence" on that less that the two countries maintain an intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, the parties or, better still, head of the party to drive these important relations should be a key factor, which voters have in mind when they go to the polls."
Other expression of this sense of importance, we can read in the report, which he sent on 22 January 2009 Terry Breese, Charge d'Affaires in Ottawa in Ottawa, in preparation for President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the preservation of the government in the vote of confidence at the beginning of February, on the federal budget, which Canada publicly admits its first deficit for more than ten years, because of the recovery plan of 30 to 40 billion dollars," says M. Breese.
There was no mention of the fact that the government had to postpone Christmas meeting of Parliament, so that she could not be slaughtered that the coalition and the opposition parties make their survival of the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed ambassador Wilkins, highlights Washington on the increasingly more negative image, which in the United States cast a dramatic series broadcast on CBC.
Ambassador is concerned about the broadcasting Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which can be seen not too clever references to the Canadian torture Arar, "No to Fly - List" or also on the abduction for the purposes of violent interrogation by the CIA.
Other report presenting that at their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked his French partner Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe is prepared to accept some of the prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of the principle of "case by case."
At the end of the meeting, it says here, "handed a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15 year old Muslim of Canadian origin, State Secretary."
"Secretary has adopted with the fact that the folder revising."
Finally, it should be noted that the person concerned by WikiLeaks, sweat.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to thank Stephen Harper, he said to the CBC that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "destroyed."
The word had that I heard about it, and Mike Huckabee in the United States.
The global plan for the reconstruction of lighting
The UN yesterday in Cancún has proposed a plan for the recovery of the domestic lighting, lighting business and industrial space in 100 countries in order to achieve the limit the greenhouse effect (g), which is almost one third of the further restriction, which needs to be done to stabilise the climate of the planet from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the stage of large concrete projects that he wants the United Nations to impose in Cancún to offset the absence of a difficult sale commitments to reduce on the industrialised countries.
The last plan submitted if the incandescent light bulbs to monopolize still 50 to 70% of the market, we replace bulbs fluokompaktními or, better still, bulbs elektroluminiscentními diodes (DEL or "LEDs" in English), a fundamental quantity of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) g of emissions on the planet would be incurred because of lighting odbouralo.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the car park on the planet.
In Copenhagen, in the last year, a large country with a significant share of emissions as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, involved in voluntary plans to reduce, which should enable the decline in global emissions g from 53 to 49 Gt Gt.
But will be deducted from the balance still 5 Gt to achieve by 2020, stabilizing the heated climate change to 2 degrees Celsius in order to exclude that he can't get out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs contain 95% of the energy must be in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of the light.
With fluokompaktními bulbs with energy consumption reduces by 75%, and with the new bulbs DEL, zredukujeme this consumption twice more.
Fluokompaktní light bulbs will last on average, from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new light bulbs with DEL, such that he made this week in the production of Philips - this company was allegedly participated in a study of the UN - have expected useful life of 25 000 hours and consumes about 80% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, which gives us an idea of possible saving with a plan of the refund, which would apply in 100 countries.
All these new light bulbs can also work with reostaty and emit less heat.
And do not contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed reservations about fluokompaktním light bulbs because they contain mercury and they should be sort as a hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless manufacturers have set up the junkyard.
But, as the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluokompaktní bulb, but rather the coal burning power plants, which emit a lot of mercury needed for the production of electricity wasted in the incandescent bulbs.
Only in the United States, the center they put into circulation 25 000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report also states in detail the profits, which would be of this international programme of any country.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year for the purchase electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power stations whose construction would cost 2.5 billion
Cote d'Ivoire is impatiently awaiting the results of the election results.
UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, he asked for the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in the Ivory Coast, after the expiry of the time limits.
"Secretary General stresses the need for an independent electoral commission has finished its work and immediately announced the preliminary results, said the president of the United Nations."
"Calls on all parties in the Ivory Coast and institutions to show their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the notification makeshift results."
Despite the pressures of some foreign governments left Election Commission have passed the ultimate date - Wednesday midnight - without results published, three days after the Sunday skrutiniu.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president in the CEI TV confirmed that the Commission "continues in the work of the" to be able to announce the results.
In the center of the world have the challenges that CEI has declared at last name the winner of the second round, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo Alassanem Ouattara and a member of the opposition.
But camp Gbagbo relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for "fraudulent" vote in the north, which is administered by former rebels New Army (FN) from the failure of the coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N 'Guessan, the director of the presidential election campaign in the Ivory Coast, he confirmed that the manoeuvres of intimidation of voters, which practiced the University Hospital (New Army) in the north of the country, to deter supporters of the president of the Ivory Coast from that, to go to vote.
Elections could be avoided if the Constitutional Council take account of the matters to which he handed Gbagbo.
However, the opponents of President Gbagbo have considered that the Supreme Court, the country is not neutral, because it controls Paul Yao N 'dré, very close to a political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man from the north, who dementuje any connection with the former rebels, condemned the delay in the announcement of results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba that is respected, but it didn't go so far that only claiming victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, because he knows that he suffered a loss, and that to make a complaint to the Constitutional Council, after the Electoral Commission said the results of the day, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, under way on Sunday, it was considered to be a coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which is already divided into two years half.
The attention of the United Nations in the centre of the political faction of Côte d'Ivoire that could be made liable for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, October 31, as the winner with 38% of the vote, compared to 32% for Alassana Ouattaru to win public support for former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains in the third quarter in France stable.
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the words by the International Labour Office (BET) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7%), including overseas areas, as shown by the provisional data with seasonal variations (CVS), which on Thursday published INSEE.
The number of unemployed has stabilised at 2,631 million in the metropolis.
The data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
For one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 point.
In a broader scope, 3.4 million people in the metropolitan France in the third quarter is not working, but they would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks, so that they can work, and regardless of whether they are looking for work or looking.
The situation of the current young people in the labour market, even stepped up with the new increase in unemployment rates reaching to 24,2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 point in three months, plus 0.5 point for one year), and 25% including overseas areas.

Only the population aged 25 to 49 years recorded a benefit from the stability of unemployment to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0,1 point in three months, plus 0.1 point for one year), and 8.8% across France.
INSEE already publishes monthly unemployment rate since 2006, and that after the polemics on the method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, by contrast, continues in the monthly statistics, and on Tuesday announced the rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after September amounted to 9.9%.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and given into custody

Case Clotilde Reiss: Elysejský palace exaggerated mediation of Syria
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Deal Klotildy Reissové, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spying," united views in France, said diplomacy to alert status and stress relations between Paris and Tehran.
All closely monitored, diplomats from the United States.
American documents, received by WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
Describe how the palace Elysejský explained its strategy to the Americans, and he went so far as to give them advice on how to deal with such cases of hostages in Iran (a small group výletníků).
Show, as the head of the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not compensation against release Majida Kakavanda, under which the Iranians in France and the US sought justice for the illicit trafficking of material in favour of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, undergo bright light the way in which the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to akreditovali idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al Assad, played a central role in the liberation Klotildy Reissové.
In fact, for it did nothing.
Diplomatic cable written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has a headline: "Iran: The French comments to the solution in the case of the hostages."
Advisor from the Elysée Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Afrikua Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with a representative of the American diplomacy Allegrone.
Him explain the French method.
Recommend the Americans to do as much for it to be transported back to the country of their own nationals of the violence of the detainees in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "constantly strongly mispronounce as" in the media, the words' fundamental rights of man ," the" innocence ," the" immediate release ."
It is necessary to bring the distress of the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more, the more you will ask you to stop with that.
Because attempts were made on the negotiations through discrete channels, "silence solves nothing," the Iranians are "masters on evasive maneuvers."
Mr Richier recalls that the arrests of foreigners is "the Iranian family tactic: Hostage taking for the purposes of" political blackmail. "
Announces that exemption Klotildy Reissové (which occurs on 16 August, the day will give her refuge the French embassy) "will require payment of high amounts of the Iranians" (bail 230 000 euros).
And that the palace Elysejský contract anticipates this cases of hostages, the phenomenon that "will vyostřovat."
Iranians would "in the future, they could arrest other about 1,800 of the French living in Iran," says.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reissová left prison before the 12 days, but still remains blocked in Iran.
The information spreads: Iranian Majid Kakavand, of which the United States, argue that he was expelled for the illegal trade with electronic material sensitive in relation to Iran, is in Paris released on the basis of the decision of the judge.
The American embassy, as many observers consenting to this worrying consensus.
For Washington, which is chasing illegal Iranian networks to the acquisition of material intended for nuclear program, is the advance of Majida Khakavanda the bad news.
France came to the deal?
Exemption Iranians for the liberation of a young French woman?
The next interview with Kathleen Allegrone, 4 September, François Richier assured that this is not the case.
Elysejský palace, as it says, has not only been "shocked by this decision by the judge," but looking for the opportunity to stand up against that.
"Talks were held between the presidency and the minister of justice" (at that time, Michele Alliot Marie), but "French government is unable to change the decision of the court," he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" supervision of the French intelligence services.
Advisor to the Elysée the phone number, hanging up the phone and then inform the American diplomat that Iranian man is currently in Paris buildings managed the Iranian Embassy. "
At the time of the detentions Klotildy Reissové in Iran develops Elysejský palace efforts, negotiates, through communiqués and organised "evasion" in the media, that he convinced that Syrian President Bachar Al Assad plays "significant" and "influential" role as a mediator ."
Americans are watching this activity not without irony, and note that the handling is now bearing fruit, because a number of articles in the press reflects the official version.
A telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blest" French officials ."
What is based on a level of "gratitude," expressed against M. Assadovi, he asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their declaration full chvalořečí French official officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea about what the Syrians, in fact, have made."
The document then deals with the reasons which have forced Elysejský palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "is to validate the policy of President Sarkozy's opening to Syria," analyses.
The policy applied in 2008 "was observed a number of critical voices in France and abroad, and marked as premature and unwarranted."
Thus, "as an exaggeration Syrian role," Paris seeks to "demonstrate Syria as encomiums may warrant, if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also "to plant grain this excitement between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows it from a very good source.
11 August, François Richier told him: "We don't know, of course, if the Syrians do something, whatever it is."
"But yet we thank them."
"That should at least bring chaos and confusion between the Iranians."
Klotilda Reissová returning to France, 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy has accepted in the Élysée Palace.
In the communiqué thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role in favour of the exemption of our krajanky."
The end of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt the law entitled "Peciválský," which will prohibit adolescentům play online games after midnight, by block access to them, said responsible government officials.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December, so that he could ask companies operating online games to block access to these Games after midnight to anyone under 16 years, said by officials of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry for the family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems with learning in school, and are not able to lead a normal life during the day."
"We consider that this law is essential for it to ensure their health and their right to sleep," he said in the AFP Jo Rin, a leading official at the Ministry, who is in charge of the draft law.
Online games will be newly accessible from 6 o'clock in the morning.
Company will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he added.
The Government also assumes that it will ask the company to limit the daily time access to these games for young people whose parents request it, said responsible worker.
It can also be available to people who request it, free programs to limit the time spent on the internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "disabled" and the daily press regularly brings different facts associated with intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed master in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea has won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, and that in the face of 58 other peoples.
The World Cup in 2018 / 2022: FIFA establishes of the host country.
Full of unrest because of suspicion of corruption establishes the Executive Committee on Thursday Fifa host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, the selection of the most politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risk that will prevail over the technical criteria.
Thing is certain, the royal competition in the year Fifa 2018se will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain and Portugal, the Netherlands and Belgium).
Czech in the year 2022 will be much more exotic, while the International Federation hopes that she will be able to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue in the introduction to the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
List of personalities involved in delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, the head of the government officials in Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff once said) gives the opportunity to form an idea of the scale of the economic and political bets around the world.
The negotiations behind the scenes faces the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish the hierarchy of the candidates.
According to the assessment report Fifa documentation, the English, the Spanish / Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for 22 members of the executive committee in an hour for the vote.
Sunday Times in the early detection, leading to the suspension of two of the members of the CE / European Commission? / for corruption (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adama) may destroy the chances of their country, the cradle of football, which has hosted the world championship only once, in the year.
The BBC on Monday on the crown, if broadcast a document that "rupture on the pin" CE (three influential members of the European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How make Fifa nespokojenou and bring into difficulties English leaders with David Cameron in the first place.
Prime Minister hopes that he will be able to repeat the move that worked his predecessor in office Tony Blair, in 2005, was able to win for London the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012.
It will do this intense activity to England added a new gloss of the name in the CE (of the European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain because a pair of Spain - Portugal miss the cards already prepared stadiums, his bill (the World championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, the Euro 2004 in Portugal) and the football culture.
But the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions of a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only enhance the position of Russia, which has been a basket case despite the gaps in his documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin ruled that the World Cup was put into the Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote, in the verbal equivocation just barely crooked in charge of the English press against members of the CE (the European Commission).
"We will be after them to throw mud, we will try to compromise herself," said Mr Poutin.
For the year 2022 appears to be the logical favourite of the United States, with its considerable experience of 1994.
The performance of the economy in the world, the seat of the main sponsors of the Fifa, it seems that the country has a large lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, produce a beautiful project.
But these applications appear to be premature for both countries, which together in 2002, "the test."
Another threat: The world championship 2026: China, which has ardently wants Fifa, has made Asian chance for the year 2022 invalid.
With Qatar, who drew up the big ace in the form of a futuristic stadiums, and Australia would Fifa continue its expansion into new landscapes, but the two countries represent more risks than the securities.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pay for their poor charges TV (because of the time lag) paid European countries, forming a powerful force for Fifa.
The second mandate: Zřejmost (security)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand woke the appearance that is hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac, did not hesitate in the least.
Nicolas Sarkozy and even less than they are.
The mandate Elysejskému palace calling someone else.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But zřejmost is not in harmony with the share of the secret of the holder of the functions.
Therefore, it is necessary to do, as the doubts constantly persisted.
In one, and in the second sense.
In 2006, without that I wanted to believe friends of Jacques Chirac will make claims to a third mandate was not excluded.
15 November with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy said that "he decides ever in the autumn of 2011."
Both recalls before the members of the Parliament of the UMP in the middle of the night in the Élysée Palace, the perspective of "two mandates" planted little feverish state.
It was an official announcement of his candidacy?
That was not far away.
The President only reminded that an adjustment of the Constitution in 2008 to reduce the number of five years to two terms of office.
It was just a statement from his party, no notice.
This is not the first time that reminds at such meetings a humorous tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have still seven and a half years with me," he said in July 2009.
The rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think neuvažuji the next stage."
The two statements it does not make a candidate more than the previous day; it does not make him a candidate even less.
If cause the comments, it is because of a dual truth.
Speeding up the path to run into the PA, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry into the arena Ségolèna Royal Palace, what pushes Nicolas Sarkozy, to be convicted.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012, it is clear that the many in the PA want order to combat reports rather premature than intended.
A survey, on the other hand.
First, the voters of the right would prefer the nomination of François Fillon before the candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to a BVA-L 'Express).
"We have a candidate, and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP," reacted immediately, and the five people in the vicinity of the Prime Minister.
"If they believe possible defeat, will not stand," tells Jean Pierre Monsieur Raffarin.
"Will still believe that it can win," corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with zřejmostí.
The euro: The European Central Bank to continue in their purchases of titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central in the year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions to get out of the crisis, or, at least, the notice of suspension of a large number of unusual operations of monetary policy, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The European sovereign debt crisis, the Institute for the issue of securities, no doubt, will not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of deterioration in the situation today already strained on European markets with the securities.
The political cost would be about it.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde to pay tribute to an active role by the European Central Bank in favour of a solution to the crisis of European states.
She didn't want to say whether he thinks that the bank could do more, for example, that it would increase its program of buying sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my account for my European partners (...) ."
The night before, in Brussels, in its questioning Commission for economic and monetary affairs of the European Parliament, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean Claude Trichet, he didn't show up like výřečnější in respect of his intentions, and finally with the fact that he said that the purchase of state titles in the secondary market "continues" and that "we will see how we decide" during the session, which is this Thursday.
The only certainty: The European Central Bank will keep an eye on its fundamental constant interest rates to 1%, its historically the lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, buying bonds from the treasury by the Central European Bank has doubled in the last week at nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And thanks foolishness dohodců in the market has made yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, the central banks have bought eurosystému at 67 billion from May 2010.
Between dealers in the market anticipating on the continuation of purchases with no margin for any doubt (see page 29).
Even the economists do not expect any significant change of course.
If the operation loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the Central European Bank, approaches these latter bank to the unlimited provision of liquidity under the generous conditions, and for a period of between one week and three months.
Economists now expect that this mechanism will be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that he would change substantially its programme."
"If not, it would mean to take the risk of causing a short term of a new strain," said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"Progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011, it seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Bräms, an economist for Sal.
Oppenheim..
To plan its interventions in the market with public debt, "it would have to the European Central Bank to maintain the volume of the purchase of its bonds to revive dull market," added Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposure of European banks on the markets of the sovereign debt in the euro area has no choice on nothing other than to maintain its presence in the market.
"He needs at any price to replace the lack of investors in the market, and to act in such a way as to prevent the outbreak of paid performance states belonging among the most fragile," testified yesterday a significant bond manager.
Because if interest rates rose, the States will be more of it, in order to reduce their debt, instead it had stabilized.
It is a rescue of the euro for this price.
Berlusconi's government in Italy, so she does back
After the beginning of the week for Italy is a worrying situation a little bit loose, yesterday with flow bond interest to 10 years.
Return to a temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the minister for the economy of the region have said that they heard Giulia Tremonti, what qualifies the situation as "nerozřešitelnou" and that he expects the "unpredictable" weekend, which then dementoval port.
In any case in Tuesday departure from the long German interest reached a record 210 basis points and price contracts to cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) soared up to 263 points, which has caused some excitement in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers of the Silvio Berlusconi said that in Spain the derogation with the German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" in the markets, "and the possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that of Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, the problem is the lack of growth and weak fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand, and it runs the risk of the state that it will not be able to cover the necessary funding.
Last forecasts of Brussels were for the government of a cold shower.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012, while the budget available Senate on his analysis, to 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, calculates the European Commission, will represent the public finance deficit still 4.3% of the gross domestic product in the next year (against 3.9% of the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Then the reputation of a new list contains accessories to the draft budget, which could be put in place after the holidays, in the amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, they will have to be adopted stringent new measures," the Commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we repeat it for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Management Board of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, nor short or long term, because, despite its significant debt (119,2% of the gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), it is the effort to stabilise the required in Italy less than the efforts required from other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist OCDE.
Remains the question of political instability.
14 December Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies and subsequently after that may start to organise the elections, which is calculated at the end of March.
Launched this period, few suitable for the adoption of a decision in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans think about strengthening of crisis control mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde that yesterday again underlined in the framework of a press conference in Paris: "I think the Europeans it demonstrated in Sunday in the course of the day and night, are obviously very determined of solidarity, committed to defend its currency and its monetary zone."
Though everything is relative, the last recorded expansion, for the interest in European government bonds, has brought into the hands of the governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can't even talk about the start of the normalization.
Office for notation Standard & Poor's announced that it could downgrade the record on the debt of Portugal, the goal, which is the focus of different speculation.
"Because in May, is a real lack of transparent and clear policy, specifically on banking systems," the economists Exane BNP Paribas.
The more that "the political time is running more slowly than the time the market."
Aware of the interrupted context, and the danger that is hiding, intensifying European countries of the debate, to strengthen the existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and on a wider scale with their counterparts from the G20, they are going very well.
With respect to the meetings of the Eurogroup (Eurogroupe) and the grouping of Ecofin from the beginning of next week.
Meeting of the European Central Bank is taking place today.
The programme is the fate of unconventional measures to support the countries of the euro area, with a focus on markets (see above).
With regard to the European Globalisation Finance (FESF), the Executive Director, Klaus Regling, zapořčal on Tuesday in Singapore trip to Asia, with the aim of informing investors from the Far East on the development of the crisis in Europe.
If it is not the aim of this path to raise funds, it certainly is preparing the ground to achieve this objective.
The first issue of securities FESF foreseen for the next month.
Yesterday, the American official told the official to Reuters that the United States will support a possible increase in the financial resources mobilised through engagement in additional direct FMI.
The country, which is in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, particularly in terms of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms, which are attached to the stringent measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid another way than used by Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid that if they asked for international assistance before exercises its own budgetary korektivy and before deciding on the structural reforms necessary to once again have a permanent confidence.
Equity participants in European funds speak at length about the options, available for the acceleration of the process of normalization markets with sovereign bond market.
On his way to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea of whether enough 750 billion mobilized Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate again touch on the supply of securities.
Economists at Barclays Capital, which is a partner of the first plan of trade with the European sovereign debt, assessed that the addition of around 100 billion euros would suffice, "better" in the form of the direct provision of financial liquidity.
The resource exists: It is the European Financial Stability, subsidized to this day of 60 billion euros.
The Council, which has all the chance that was tested in European capitals.
When the deteriorating market conditions.
Snow and ice: 24 counties has an orange emergency.
Snow allocations cause more trouble in transport, particularly on the roads of the other classes in Brittany, and there is a risk that some will undermine the economic activity.
Twenty four districts have from now on the orange emergency due to the risk of snow and ice.
L 'Eure, L' Eure-et-Loir, les deux-Sèvres and La Vienne, joined the 20 districts, which have already issued the orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to France Météo considerable heavy snow is causing problems in the north of the Gironde and forest Charentes and faintly it snows on the Ile de France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the district and a rug from 1 to 3 cm, points to 5 in the Paris region.
Districts are affected Charente, where the Charente Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and districts in areas of Basse Normandy, the Ile de France and Limousin.
Heavy snow are large enough to have caused difficulties in transport and upset some economic activity, predicts Météo France.
On the coast of the Côtes d'Armor, some districts have banned the passage of a heavy freight - lorries over 7.5 tonnes with route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on the roads of the other classes in Brittany is very difficult to police and police recommended scam with his vehicle, only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks for this day was canceled.
In Pikardii school links on Thursday have been banned.
In the middle of the night, do not envisage any specific measures for the restriction of freight transport.
The District Authority "calls on all car drivers for the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt the driving nature of the road."
Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to lift on Thursday, 25% of its flights at Roissy airport in Paris and 10% at Orly because of the expected runoff of snow.
DGAC recommends passengers using air transport services, contact with their companies.
In the United Kingdom are until Thursday's wounds closed Gatwick Airport in the South London and the airport in Edinburgh in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: The first of the financial proposals
Since the debate about the modernisation of transport on the Ile de France in full swing, it's raining billion.
At least during the discussion.
We recall particularly 23 billion for the underground Grand Paris, which is to build a company Société du Grand Paris.
That this structure could be started, announced the state grant of $4 billion.
It is a theoretical amount, which then will allow society SGP apply to contracts part of the financing from its dual source.
Today, finally, we come to the first amendments.
Rectifying the law about funding from 2010, which examines the financial committee of the National Assembly today morning, contains mechanisms set to ensure these funds.
There are two: The creation of a special tax on equipment and an increase in the tax on the offices on the Ile de France.
First, we'll read in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is in favour of the public institutions of Société du Grand Paris ."
Is quantified: "The yield from this interest is 117 million euros per year."
The second is the reconstruction of rates for the office, which already exists, "to be modernised in order to increase the yield obtained from it, and to ensure this increase hurt Société du Grand Paris."
How much would gain?
A mirage.
It is not vyčísleno in the text.
The 4 billion we have far away.
"It is clear that these fiscal resources are attached to the 4 billion euros of capital grant that will be mobilised by the state and put into company Société du Grand Paris under the project," we can read in the explanation of reasons.
Us in society SGP is this system seems shocking.
"From when we created (both income tax ndlr), we can cover a study for three years and then make a grab into 4 billion, explains here."
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used as necessary."
The SGP is considered that will be credited to 4 billion in 2013 for the budget for the year 2014.
This mechanism in which 4 promised billions are still absent abonentům, risks causing a somewhat busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Vindictive hackers and spy přičinliví
The case WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it is revealed an obvious scandal, a scandal, which seems to be the scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, talking about the deep changes at the international level, and anticipates the future ruled by the regression.
But, let us move in order.
The first aspect of the WikiLeaks, this is a confirmation of the fact that every document drawn up by the secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively from press cuts.
"Extraordinary discovery" Americans about the sex life of Berlusconi is announcing what he has for months, everyone could read in any issue (all except these two Berlusconi own), and the infamous karikaturní profile Kadáfího was for a long time for the cabaret artist for the sketches.
Rule that secret documents may consist only of the reports already known, it is essential in the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go into a bookshop, which devotes ezoterické literature, you will see that each work repeated (on Graalu, if the mystery of Rennes in Château, or Templářích zednářích) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And it is not only that the author of the occult texts I hate looking for new information (not even know where to look for reports on nonexistent), but because those who deal with the occult believe only what they know and what confirms what had previously taught.
It is a mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same is true for the secret documents.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit), the head of the secret services (and, if not, it could be, as I know, the editor of the newspaper Libération), which considers it true only what he admits.
The information with a high suppression of Berlusconi, which the American Embassy sent the ministry, were the same that Newsweek published the week before.
Why, then, about the revelation of these documents have so much fuss?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured man knows, and that the embassy while, at least since the end of World War II and since you can telephone or the heads of state to fly the plane for a joint dinner, lost its diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercise in representation transformed in Intelligence.
Any spectator watching films on the investigation knows very well that, from whom it only seemingly ignores.
However, the fact that it is being repeated publicly, have vilified the obligation of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most strictly classified information the most powerful country in the world is a tough blow, not negligible, for the prestige of the public sector.
Scandal affects as the victims, so his "executors."
But let us get out of here a deep truth about what happened.
Once, in times of Orwell's Big Brother, it was possible to absorb all power, as some sort of Big Brother, which was checking every movement of its people.
Orvellovo prophecy has been demonstrated since the ability to control every move by phone, each carried out the transaction, visited the hotel, used the highway and so on, he became a citizen of an absolute victim of wreaths of power.
But when demonstrate how it is now that even "tomb" with nejtajnějšími information cannot resist a powerful intervention of a hacker, ceases to be a control report one way and becomes by a circular.
Much controls every citizen, but each citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen - may know all the secrets of power.
How can he hold the power, which already has the option of retaining their own secret?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that the true secret is bereft of a secret (and bereft secret it could never be revealed); it is also true that all the information about the nature of the Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed mysterious bezobsažným secret, because it is drawn from public life; but to discover, just as it did WikiLeaks that secret Hillary Clinton was bezobsažnými secrets, withdraw him all the power.
WikiLeaks did no mistake for Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something big Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow dealt to the powers so important?
It is clear that, in the future states will not be able to send the online sensitive information - that would be tantamount to the publication on a poster, the atmosphere on the corner of the street.
But it is also quite clear that the current technology is useless to hope that can be sustained in the secrecy of the report on the phone.
Nothing is easier than to determine whether and when the head of state travelled by plane and joined with some of his colleagues.
How will be able to be maintained in the future in the classification of private and sensitive news?
I know that, for the moment, my forecast belongs in science fiction and, therefore, it is fantastic, but I have to imagine the government officials, who are carrying discreetly the formalities after uncontrolled routes and to carry only messages that they know by heart, or rather they conceal rare information in his heel shoes.
Information will be maintained in the unique copies in drawers concluded the key: On the whole, an attempt on espionage in the Watergate affair was less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now moving sideways forward, it means backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph marked a revolution in road, Internet rehabilitating telegraph based on the wires (phone).
Video (analog) allowed for lovers of cinema to read film, step by step, move it forward and backward, and reveal all the secrets of the assembly, while now CD (digital) allow just jumping on chapters, that means after makroporcích.
By means of trains too we get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the way by plane and transport, which includes we need three and a half hours.
So it is extraordinary that the policy and communication technology will be back to the carts towed the horses.
The last note.
Sometimes, the press tried to understand what had in secret embassy.
Now the embassy, which are asking for confidential information from the press.
The climate: Both France Hackla their promises on financing
Year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to test promises to quickly odblokovaná financing (already financing with the Quick Start (fast start) or premature), the developed countries.
And a large French hacky unearthed
In the Copenhagen Agreement developed countries committed to provide 30 billion dollars from 2010 to 2012.
The European Union promised to 7.2 billion for three years and France 1.26 billion (that is, 420 million a year).
At the opening of the EU COP16 pulled the big ace, to convince their partners on the reality of his commitment to financing fast start: The report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, grand side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparent operation invaluable and priced on its real value: The advanced countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries and civil society as well, and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU gives notice that in 2010 free 2.2 billion, which brings it on the right path to compliance with its promise of $7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we look at the detail, we see that things are much more complicated.
These funds are under the Copenhagen Accord "new and additional" to ensure that there is an increased burden realized without to the detriment of public aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what it means "new and additional."
While the European Commission has proposed the harmonisation, some member states, among others, France, blocked the process.
Today everyone selects the reference that fits him best.
The European Commission, for example, considered the reference year 2009: The international financing, and she is in it adds yet 150 million over three years, under the financing fast start.
Other countries have chosen a similar reference with annual payment deadlines or with dates at the level of public support for the development.
By contrast, France is considered that the financing of the "new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to the expenses of the previous period, or on the global level of public aid for development Aide publique d 'development.
Specifically, the total amount of aid to developing countries, France may remain constant (or even lower), has met its commitment for the financing of the "new and additional..."
Another crucial element is the distribution of the grants and loans.
There is no rule, and each will choose its own method of calculation.
Some, like France, they think that 1 €on loan equals 1 €a gift.
Obviously, it is difficult to prove: The effort is not přirovnatelná.
If the use of loans can be demonstrated for some investments which are profitable (often for projects associated with a reduction in the emission of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present a single euro, which we get, as the equivalent of one of the euro, which we give..., we should not be understood by its obligations, but as the price of the loan for the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rates).
But France may submit only such reason "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million euros, makes that 91.5% of the loan (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of gifts (36,1 million euros) - see the document of the EU, so that they can check.
It is the only country of the Union, which is a loan on this scale.
Germany had required 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among others) comply with their commitments with 100% of gifts.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union would give 1 €on within the satisfaction of his promise, France only 10 centimes and considers this effort for a comparable.
Beautiful kejklířský piece!
For the summary, in their financing 'fast start' France operates with dual šejdířstvím: On the one hand, with the development of the stock in time and on the other side with real financial burdens.
Although the issues just 36,1 million euros, can persuade that issued 420 million euros "new and additional" in the context of his promises.
Handling of the Minister of Finance (because it appears that although it's Bercy, who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why should the Member States to continue the donation, if you need only to lend?) and in the negotiations because developing countries are not completely naive...
Chapter of early funding is only a small otázečkou, relatively short term, in relation to a series of discussions on climate change.
But it could be a grain of sand, in addition, in a huge machine, which is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that it is not the case.
Whether anything, it is necessary to draw the lessons from this first year of early funding.
France should notify a change in its way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations, and of decency and justice for the other countries of the European Union.
But, above all, France should avoid discussions on deposits in the long term financing (other crucial chapter currently diskutovaná): Prey to the issue of "additionality condition" or on the posting loans.
France should change its position to become so pokrokářská for these deposits, as it is for the other.
All hope is pinned on the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet for that, which arrives in Cancun next week.
Surprising announcement on the fast start of France and on its vision of "additionality condition" and the use of loans could cause an increase in the level of international confidence, necessary to be able to move on in the discussions.
Alarm on pesticides, which the children they have digested.
Ten years of a child will devour one day, 81 of the various chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the Association Budoucích generations (ex- Movement for Rights and the conservation of future generations).
Association, which highlights that its results, "they have no significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the pending issues," bought between July and September the foods commonly consumed in four meals and one easy food as a light lunch for one child about 10 years in the supermarket in L 'Oise and in Paris.
The typical food, including the official recommendation - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water a day - as well as sweets, were analysed research laboratories to chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, and other pollutant factors.
Balance of the saucer is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances of 42 classified as carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five of the substances are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances which could act as disruptive for the gland with internal secretions (PE), according to the studies of a few institutions, such as the International Centre for cancer research.
"Although almost all cases in the legal limits for each chemical adopted individually are not exceeded, in our research, well, we see that the reality in consumer exposure kontaminujícím substances may be carcinogenic, and / or the PE is astonishing," says the association.
Butter for breakfast and tea with milk contain themselves about ten résiduí with possible carcinogenic effects, and three proven as a carcinogen, as in the case of about twenty of residues, which could disrupt the hormonal system.
An apple, imported from Brazil, the studies as a small snack contains traces of six chemicals, including in France a disabled fungicidal resource.
The same is true for the green beans of Kenyi, included in the lunch in which the study found strong insecticides banned in the EU.
Moreover, the steak of minced meat, tuna in a tin and even a bun and gum were prošpikované pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water from the tap of the analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
Salmon steak dinner was "the richest" with 34 objevenými chemical reziduy analysis and even plastic plates, used to warm meals in the microwave with no analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this "cocktails of contaminants" is probably underestimated, "the results from the study.
The Association Organic Europe - the Greens (EE / LV) suggested "in the face of an emergency situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop, "the increase in diseases of civilisation."
In July, the study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the status of the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereáliích.
