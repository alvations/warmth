Inflation European slipped in food
Inflation accelerated, recorded in the euro area, is due firstly to the rapid growth of the price of food products.
The rise in prices in November has been greater than expected in the 13 countries of the euro zone, recording - after the 2.6% of October - an annual inflation of 3.1% - announced the statistical office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
The forecasts official only gave as likely a 3% - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the issuing banks American, British and Canadian, not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the reduction, together with increasing prices of raw materials and forced to reduce unemployment, lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the rate of inflation below, but at least close to 2%.
According to a analyst, the ECB is into the trap 22: "We must negotiate" on inflation to subsequently does not have to intervene in this matter.
The inflation of the 3.3%, registered in Germany, beating the record for twelve years; whereas in Espana increased 3.6 to 4.1%.
Inflation were shot in the euro zone as a result of the rampant prices food and energy.
Contributions to end of wheat increased by 88% and also the value of soya reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, had to pay much more in the 2007 for the vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this in a 52%, reaching already last month the black gold almost 100 dollars a barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 2.1% now to 2.5%, in exchange for the 2009 diminish already to 1.9.
According to analysts, the annual inflation will remain in the coming 3 or 4 months around 3%, but the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, it is expected that during the 2008 the ECB twice reduce interest rates.
Gallup provides for a government crisis
After a long stagnation, for the beginning of December the support of the Alliance of young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - a 13% - in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the electorate certain parties, due to the more firmly of the electorate of the opposition - would mean a support of the more than two thirds (a 71%) in the face of the support of a fifth for the Socialists (20%).
According to the survey, the democratic forum and the alliance of free democrats not achieved or limit the necessary to have any Escano parliamentary: its support within the entire population is of 2%.
Among voters safe there is more than one per cent sympathisers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the lowest ebb previous - has never been so high, 41% the proportion of those who judged particularly bad the economic situation in the country, as another 46% believes that the situation is rather bad.
Families, after the expectations more hopeful of spring and the summer, are now more pessimistic about the change in their own economic situation.
With regard to the next, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth expected improvements.
In December, 71% of the figure consulted, greater than any previous survey of the Gallup, estimated that the President of government Desempena more harm than good.
13% of the consulted hopes or Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of the 38% of the consulted.
A 54% of the population does not trust in all in the head of government and a 27% does not trust in the President of the Alliance of young Democrats.
One of the indicators of shaping the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks that it is possible to monitor the discontent experienced in the face of the person of the head of government without a change of government.
While after the riots on October last 35% considered that it would be desirable to remain in power to the government and Prime Minister, currently this ratio is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) believes that the only solution is the new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterised by the fact that 60% of those questioned the question of the participation replied that would participate Surely and another 20% said that is likely to be involved.
By way in comparison, "general elections to be held this Sunday" participate with security only 55% of the population and another 15% believes likely their participation. On the basis of the current intentions of the voters there can be no doubt the result of the referendum.
A 74% of the population the payment of the rights of studies, 79% of the service of medical consultations and a 84% of the hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only between the participants insurance in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89% of the electorate reject the introduction of the rights of studies, payment for the medical consultations and hospital care.
The more expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco their prices
kept the average increase price levels of 16% of the supermarkets triangle commercial gold Budaörs, with the difference that this has not been increased VAT.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
This also rose by an average of 16% in the triangle commercial gold Budaörs the Canasta customary Christmas of the newspaper Napi, but in all supermarkets recorded growth much higher than the thousand Huf.
As in December last had already been "roof" prices in supermarkets food, this is not experienced a higher percentage drastic compared with the high point of departure.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers the fact that what the past were able to buy a price well below the nine thousand Huf today can not do or ten thousand.
The Canasta of Napi in supermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 Huf the limit psychological ten thousand Huf.
And the Canasta of highest value was of 10 573 Huf.
(in the 2003 that Canasta cost 6800 Huf.)
The price of spirits and fish remained almost at the level of the previous, but there was a sharp increase in the steak of Pechuga of Turkey, nut and seed poppy.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed data from the Central Statistics Office, although in the Auchan we have found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 Huf.
Competition does not reduced the price of the product to less than 200 Huf.
Equally was surprising in this shop that the price of Coca-Cola with bottle Redimible of two litres cost less than 200 Huf, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost just 257 Huf.
However, in the Canasta of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with regard to the price of the Christmas of the past, Cora increased with 15, while Tesco and Auchan with around 18% prices in the Canasta of Napi.
Comparing the values of Canasta more side of the past with the of the Canasta cheaper of this, the gap has been a 12%, while growth between the cheapest of the past and the most expensive of this has been a 21%.
The average growth was 1480 Huf.
The past the average growth of prices was of 1206 Huf, so that during the Christmas of the past in prices felt the increase in VAT.
It is precisely this process which was destroyed, trade supermarkets visibly were incapable of making decision on the margin of prices to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of change in prices on consumption.
(if the trader planning badly the speed of the movement of a product, stands to lose an important benefit in the margin which is in line with turnover.)
The increase in the price of the Canasta of Napi reached such extreme as a result of the increase in VAT, that the more expensive was higher with 1720 Huf value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only a Huf.
This not there were such extremes, since the highest price of now has been 1630 Huf more than the past and the cheapest also increased with 1284 Huf.
Comparing the two seasons Navidenas, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in supermarkets grew more than 30% the price of consumer articles basic necessities.
(But this does not necessarily confirms the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some foods basic necessities recorded in the meantime of 12 months an increase in price of over 30%.
For example, in addition to the wheat, also in the case of the egg.)
According to the Canasta of Napi, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, for in the price of the product that was quite expensive because the past compared to the basis, there was, in the worst case barely 10% of rising prices.
According to all the indicators, suppliers of meal have a stronger position than those of egg, being able to impose the dramatic increase in prices even to the multinationals.
The hypermarkets not complain trade in the triangle of gold, talk constantly about positive results.
According to our experience, to the majority of consumers of the three shops visited, already are not interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, and by Paletas food preserved.
In the Manana on Wednesday, in the three shops are formed large queues ahead of boxes because suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that inside the country volumes of sale are lower, many multinationals complain institutes survey because revenues fall below its plans, and not only in the case of food, but also for the household appliances.
In many hospitals saves with the disinfectants
This has been made several thousand hospital infections produced in the first place over their misuse of antibiotics.
The circumstances of hygiene prevailing in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and pollution staff not encourage the control of infection - affirms the Médica-jefa unit of the national centre of epidemiology.
In many hospitals saves even with the disinfectants.
Not so long ago has been diagnosed an infection with MRSA in the department of Traumatología hospital János.
In a man in hospital after a serious accident was detected the presence of bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
The same sort of infection occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the.
A wounded of a serious car accident gave high of hospital, and the same patient shortly after due to return to the hospital as a result of the infection with MRSA and since then we have not been able to make an important surgical intervention by the presence of bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this has been made in the national system Nosocomialis surveillance 1094 cases of infection hospital produced by agents - said Karolina Böröcz, Médica-jefa unit of the national centre of epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals certainly there has been this amount of infections caused by agents, of the rest is not taken information.
Nearly two-thirds of infection (683 cases) are due to the MRSA, staphylococcus, resistant to the Meticilina-oxacilina.
A third of human beings have been in its nose bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing disease.
Infections caused by the SA (for example: the throat, Amigdalitis infections, skin, infections wounds) react well to antibiotics and are easily treatment.
However, once applied exaggerated or unduly antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, be turned into bacteria very resistant to antibiotics and quickly in conditions hospital inadequate.
Can cause serious infections hospital infections, for example of wounds firstly patients with immunodeficiency transitional or chronic, patients with the body weakened, or the elderly people of little weight.
In view of the Médico-director hospital János there is nothing particularly in the infection MRSA, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA only is absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where there is examined its presence.
Resistant to antibiotics
"these patients are isolated, nursing staff in gloves of Goma and mask and there are antibiotics suited to treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients hospitalized are being examined prior to verify the presence of the MRSA in his body, but even in this way can we avoid the infection in all cases.
It is fashionable not take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of the MRSA in most cases, but the present circumstances hospital national not encourage for the prevention of training and infection with pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection takes place mainly in hospitals and homes for the elderly, hospitals should examine patients hospitalized and isolate immediately Enfermes in your body the MRSA.
However, in hospitals Hungarians not is fashionable the microbiological sampling.
This fact is also due to the box national health not financed these medical examinations.
So the most cases come to light public when there are already infections of the MRSA visible in the patient - said Médica-jefa unit of central epidemiological.
The European Union makes rigorous Encomiendas for the implementation of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also directives to deal with the national infections and tables pathological.
We must Empenarse that therapy with antibiotic is aimed, in other words, should be done examinations microbiological to prevent resistance to medicines hospitals, but not always meet this requirement.
The sampling microbiological are even less frequent in the case of patients or in basic care - stated Karolina Böröcz.
Saves with the disinfectants
Experiments scientists have shown that in most cases the MRSA a patient to another through health staff.
Therefore, a very important role Desempenan laundering out of hand, the use of gloves of Goma and masks, but also in this regard are experiencing considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
The MRSA by transmission by drops and direct contact between people, but in the circumstances hospital national it is not always possible to isolate the patient infected.
Moreover, rooms hospitals are often overcrowded, beds are very often together, but to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least for a distance of 1.5 m.
Unfortunately it may have also - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of economic situation saves less favourable with the disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore a more likely to infection.
In view of Karolina Böröcz, where compliance with the appropriate measures of prevention, there are less infections such or can be stopped the spread of the pathogenic agent.
Programme government against the MRSA
The treatment of infection with MRSA is an enormous expenditure for the fund national health insurance, so that all countries are fought against him.
In Britain, for example there is a government programme to prevent and reduce instances of the MRSA.
The programme has apparently successes, according to the data provided, infection with MRSA show trend decline in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has on its agenda the prevention of agents (between these the MRSA) and the of hospital infections are due to these pathogens.

Bulgaria, paradise property of the EU
It is admirable the development of the property market Bulgarian - the attention of the whole of Europe is heading for this Balkan country before little mentioned.
What, where and those who buy in the market even cheaper of the EU, will rise quickly?
analysis of the division of Bulgarian re / Max.
The objective preferred to takeovers property in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with their cheap flats of ski slopes and the villa beaches.
The regions Montanosas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most favourite, whereas in the beaches Albena, the "golden Coast", the "Sunshine Coast", the former Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people seeking property in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts re / Max in Bulgaria sooner or later also the central part of the country - as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people buy property in the area especially cheap.
Similarly can be attractive the capital Sofia, areas trade and offices promise a speedy recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is in the best way to become one of the most commendable havens of golf of Europe, and could be a destination also highlighted during the other two stations, as well as the summer and winter.
Therefore, careful investors are already doing their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In view of the analysts, those who buy property in Bulgaria, are trying to change their lives and their way of life.
The majority of customers are British, but are also of France, Belgium, and increasingly Espana of Romania.
Also are present promoters Maltese and Cypriots and traditionally there are many customers Russians on the beaches of the Black Sea and havens ski.
Customers foreigners can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Director of regional re / Max in Bulgaria.
Those who seek to settle here are buying property or new renewed at a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them then.
Require good communication and access, as well as for them is important proximity of a large city, shops and generally of a doctor local.
Constitute the second category purchasers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of Germans).
The third group are investors property which make their purchases in the hope of benefit in the medium or long term.
The price of property Capitalinos will constantly growth, because demand is increasing.
Although the European Union in Bulgaria has home prices lower, over the past five years these suffered an annual increase in the 21%
The increase in the price of property exceeds considerably wage growth.
Fodor and by the six hundred Hungarians
According to the environment minister informed and Hidrología Gábor Fodor meetings at expert level be completed on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening negotiations will continue at ministerial level on the international climate regime post - 2012.
The experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world deliberating on the road map of Balí available on the efforts after the period of reducing emissions, laid down in the Kyoto Protocol, valid until 2012.
Currently being conducted lively discussions about this in the developing countries and industrialised.
The US has already pointed out that at the moment does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although tends to reach an agreement that compared to the situation of 1990, until 2020 decline with 25 to a 40% emissions of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect.
Another major issue of the conference is that if the industrialised countries, in addition to reduce emissions, or are not prepared to give material assistance and technological to countries in need.
There was also agree on aid to offer the developing countries.
The support fund, laid down in the Kyoto Protocol, it will be led by a board composed of 16 members, probably within the global fund for the environment of the UN (GEF) - writes the "Piac".
The six by hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for the environment and Hidrología Gábor Fodor supports the efforts of the EU to maintain its leading role in the global protection of the climate and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reduce by 2020, with regard to the 1990 level their emissions by 20% of gas, responsible for the greenhouse effect, regardless of whether or not to be signed post - 2012 "and to reduce as high as 30%, when the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries is prepared to make compromises in line with its responsibility and their skills.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that are signatories to the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 undertook to reduce in 5.2%, within this then the 15 EU Member States undertook to comply with an 8% reduction.
The commitment of Hungary is to reduce with 6% the gas emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect on the period between 1985 and 87, that our country meet - Senala the press release of the Ministry of the environment.
There is much that is at stake in Balí, as in two will have to sign the agreement international climate policy in the longer term, because otherwise, it is certain that its entry into force would continue after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments it made in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international system of reducing emissions, the need for which was perceived in its most recent report by the IPCC, association of the UN international scientific dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Prize for Peace.
Thus, the reduction of emissions would suffer a delay and could not prevent an increase of over 2 or C of the average temperature of the earth, according to the scientists would have consequences unimaginable and irreversible.
The British army recruited in Youtube
The units of the army in a British distributor of videos published recordings on actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularise themselves.
First the British air force (RAD) was the that took advantage of services of Youtube: the special units displaced in Afghanistan since the March 2006 are burden videos on their actions against the Taliban - informed the BBC.
These recordings made with mini cameras on riding helmets are monitored in the body of general operations Kandahar, then are sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
are already 139 recordings from air force soldiers who have been charged in this way to the Internet and its "channel" has been seen by more than 75 000 people.
The Ministry of Defence British recorded in spring 2007 under the name of "defence" and published videos both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, in the meantime the Ministry of the Community of Nations (British Commonwealth Office) as the multinational forces in Iraq (Mnfi) have their own channel Youtube.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally air force the videos with objectives of recruitment, but in view of the Ministry of Defence serve also to introduce you to the public the real objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This type of propaganda virtually costs nothing compared to the television spots conventional recruitment - declared to the BBC expert defence Gordon Mackenzie - on the other hand, inevitably have some political message, because in a specifically justify the raison d'être of the military action decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a videogame
The army is also concerned by the fact that, in addition to the recordings Recelosamente published and criticized, in the distributor appear also videos fans, for example on the death of the soldiers: in the films propaganda "official", a little hypocritical, the official talk as maximum losses, however, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan have borne the Internet because many videos enshrined in real operations, but the British army only recently it is taking advantage of this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly different for recruitment with the free of charge Descargables video games of shooting so-called America's, where in the midst of a situation more or less real player can be directly instead of soldiers.
And Pastelillo in the Christmas party of the ministries
does not seem very sentimental the Minister of work Mónika Lamperth: instead of the Party Navidena, held a working meeting to his colleagues who will be able to dismiss the 2007 with Pastelillo and coffee.

Will meet the forces of the strike giant
The trade unions in League and the National Federation of committees worker form the Friday to strike a committee to coordinate the strike on Monday that will last indefinitely.
On Saturday there will be a meeting of protest, while on Monday - day in the final vote to be held on the law of public health - unemployment will begin work.
Surely this action will cause great difficulties in the transport, since stop completely transit rail and until the 13 hours will be on strike also workers of the company of public transport in Budapest.
In the late on Friday the trade unions in League will report on the details of their strike on Monday that held together with the National Federation of committees worker.
It is also form the Commission to strike League and the trade union national train drivers that coordinated actions on Monday.
On Saturday there will be a meeting of protest, while on Monday trade unions participants on strike indefinitely, if there is an agreement with the government.
This means, that - in the day of the parliamentary vote on the law of public health - not informed on the date of the end of the strike begun.
If the National Assembly disapproves the law of public health, the trade unions withdrawn immediately its appeal to strike.
On the other hand, if it is adopted the law, will meet the committees to strike and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of the Monday of the National Assembly It is also possible that only vote on the law of public health in the hours very tickets evening, or perhaps nearly midnight.
As a result of the strike beginning on Monday, we will have to have significant difficulties in the transport: in the railways will no longer work indefinitely, for the Manana can to a part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of the bus of Volán.
At the same time, in many parts of the country will have closure of half of the ways of the roads.
Many trade unions and civil organisations have joined the strike, their names are updated constantly on the website of the League.
Some trade unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for time defined.
Until Thursday afternoon rail State and the free trade Union of railway workers (Sltf) could not reach agreement on services not even minimum, although, to meet the Christmas celebrations, more and more people who travel on trains.
According to information received to date, since the start of the day until 13 hours will be on strike the factory workers public transport in Budapest, Budapest airport until 9.00 Manana, hold a strike four hours' Unions League of the electricity industry and thermal energy, trade unions educators called strike 2 and the trade union democratic educators from 2 to 8 p.m.
The Hungarian Association of doctors give its opinion in national strike in hours alternative and the trade union democratic of workers in the sector of health and social (Sdtsss) that are part of the trade union Cooperation Forum, held a strike warning of two hours.
The most important of the four demands put forward by the League is that the government to withdraw its proposal on the reform of public health and put a new concept to a social debate.
The second demand is gradually to introduce the new form of calculating pensions which will enter into force on next.
The third is to ensure, even by 2010, in the event of pensions advanced the possibility of occupations that deserve to come to the system.
The fourth reason of the strike is that the free trade Union of railway workers (Sltf) that is part of the trade unions in League, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economics and transport on lines railway and expect a different proposal.
Political capital: in the country increases the risk for the guard Hungarian
According to the division of risk analysis (analysing division) by political capital activity of the Guardia Hungarian, constituted in August of this with the support of the movement for a better, Hungary has increased from various points of view the political risk from Hungary and the region.
In the "warning on risks" of the Companía is written: in relation to the activity of the Guardia Hungarian the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the escalation of ethnic tensions between the Roma population and not Roma of Hungary, even in the short term can produce confrontations ethnic violent".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Guardia Hungarian is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
Said that all this is due to one of the mistakes of the main protagonists of political life Hungarian: "the protagonists of public life I gave the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of the political groupings and radical extremists, who were able to its policy strategy based on the discrepancies between Roma and Hungarian."
This makes the problem worse, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens the extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - believe.
In addition to that, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national average and international, "deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially in regard to the stability and democratic development in the country."
Remind us that: from Otono 2006 received more and more openness and momentum the reorganisation of radical groups and extreme right in Hungary and that since the summer of 2007 have been set up in the country many organisations that of "associations of self-defense national".
"Common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organisations, while the training of its members to the defence - even armed. (civil defence, national defense, defence of public order), by referring to the inadequacies of the police, the army, in other words of the State" - add.
All this takes place in accordance with the method which seeks to give him a presentation civil to different political aspirations, on the basis of discontent with politics and society with the political parties.
Because highlight what civil and the form of partnership in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of registration legal, but at the same time is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Guardia Hungarian is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, in many neighbouring States referred to the guard Hungarian as a potential danger, while the political figures Ultra-nacionalistas of certain neighbouring countries, they want to justify their own policy Anti-húngara with the creation of the Guardia Hungarian,.
All this has an influence on the political stability of the region "- incorporated.
According to the research institute, the Constitution of the Guardia Hungarian is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that throughout the region were increased the political risks.
Wrote that the guard Hungarian works in such a way that, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Union Bulgarian national (Unb) of the extreme right.
The Constitution of the Guardia Bulgarian is due to the riots mass of the Roma that took place in one of the areas of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
By taking this situation, the Unb decided to form the guard, on the grounds that the objective of the organization is self-defense "national".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained in the face of the facts - is reminiscent of the political capital.
Incorporated: this initiative has led to a lively discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As wrote, indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes which certain organisations Roma of Bulgaria have announced that to resist, will constitute its own guard.
As the functioning of the Guardia Hungarian so far has shown similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard, can not be excluded that also gypsies of Hungary react to the threat in a similar way, by organising their own self-defense - can be read in the warning about the risks of the political capital.
The director of research of the political capital, Attila Juhász's question news agency said: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each published its risk analysis and when experiencing something that can influence the change of the risk, inform public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing its warning about the risks.
The party is not always writes with red
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days are written with red in the timetable and already has become a widespread practice that on the holidays - that the next will be less - reorganise working hours.
Even in the EU or in America are uniform parties.
The Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday, feast of State and days.
Hours essentially relate to religious parties and anniversaries historical.
The new also: both the last day of the old, as the first day of the new is festive - the latter above all so that they can rest The who spent celebrating the old.
Throughout the have eleven Christmas written with red in the timetable.
It is national day on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on 23 October, Memorial Day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August we had the founding of the state, or on 1 May the Party of the work, or 1 and 2 or November we remember our family and friends who have died.
Moreover, in our country are celebrations two days the Easter of resurrection, the whit and the Christmas.
According to the timetable, our holidays State, national or religious rarely coincide with a weekend, so often makes bridge when before or after the party there is only one working hours.
In exchange for the weekends Alargados as well, for Saturday prior can not leave of work or of school.
Is the Minister of labour which regulates in its decree specific needs to be done when exactly in exchange for hours directly precedent or after the Party.
This rule of legal is compulsory compliance for all employers and for their employees, as well as for employees and civil servants.
It is not obligatory in exchange for companies and institutions of services which, because of their role, work even during the days.
This the rules of procedure can be altered only around the celebrations of the end of: from 24 December virtually stop life in the country, because according to the experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between the Christmas and an end to the or take their holidays during these days.
The next several of our parties to coincide with the middle or with weekends, so that there will be fewer changes in working hours that this.
First will be changed agenda on the feast of work and then, for four days, successive can rest workers.
On Saturday, 26 April will be working hours, so that in return on Friday, 2 may be hours.
The other relates to change the party of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the next during the party in order to be able to rest, since from 24 December does not work in almost anywhere, not even if the last day of the is a Wednesday.

lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car is progressing slowly in the usual backlog of the Manana.
Sounds a compass Extrano on radio: violin with electronic effects.
Subo volume.
The pace of change music and tones previous is added the low and then the voice of a chorus female as a real gem intervenes.
Mr the Channel 2 reproduces the song wings of love of Zagar.
Life musical national not us Malcrió much with MAGP electronic quality.
But now seems quite different this traffic jam when you are listening to the new disc of Zagar.
Appears Yonderboi. Some songs of the new and interesting underground digital national will gradually changing the image and although it is fashionable again rock style garage, breaks Guitarras, the electro MAGP national has shown: there are developments in the sun.
Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, fell throughout Yonderboi until began his career independent perhaps because both can not be protagonists of a single whole.
With its draft (Zagar) and its music, a mixture of jazz, of music electronic Bailable and MAGP, tried to succeed, when asked Soundtracks cinema (Pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider public known as a whole that originally acted only in clubs Pequenos when the magazine wan 2 selected its first disc published in 2002 between the fifty discs national most important, classifying to Zagar, together with Yonderboi as almost the only training national trends, can be sold in western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and a whole are fashionable, but no one has been asked whether or not happy to this label.
The joint reacted as must react: prepared a disc new and even better.
The disk newly launched, entitled can not instead can open up new paths for them, although the very title seeks to establish the continuity with the initial in the city of Pécs.
Because this title was one of the lines of the whole of former Zságer.
The reference is well on the successful, on the flight, but in addition to what successful music, now appeared - and the trend in the spirit of the time - the Guitarra that sounds more strong, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs presented the record in the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer currently working in England with all the puzzle.
In the disk includes a real success of the channel Mr 2 Petõfi recently sends out of the Manana night popular music. This station led to the ears of the Radioyentes music high flight of wings of love, with six engraved singers Hungarian ($Ivas underground ").
Because everything is in order (?).
Hvg. Hu asked Zságer.
Hvg. Hu: after this new success the question arises: what the that you are interpreting, to what extent is a music devoted to a public select?
Zságer: the definition of public select for me means little.
In my view there are two types of caste music lightly; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and MAGP, but trade and sincere.
Also the so-called music alternative underground can be boring, senseless and can be made up equally only for sale, what makes trade.
But also a good pop song can arise from an inspiration sincere.
The attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, irrespective of languages and national borders.
Hvg. Hu: you see any difference between the reception of your music on the part of the public and Hungarian Foreign?
B. Zs: abroad, especially in the West of us, music lightly has traditions larger.
That is why not only generations of 15 to 20 frequent the concerts, but also the old.
Pay much more attention to the changes in its around in the music lightly, because the considered part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg. Hu: what role has the public in your work?
Do you matters who they are, where are and how many people who are listening to your music?
B. Zs: of course I am well to see that more and more people attending our concerts.
But we have never made up music to the market.
Not in music for some objective, but for some reason.
The role of the public rather is felt in concerts where there is mutual influence, but this is only in the changes inconceivable of the time.
And yet, I realised that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, lose their interest.
Hvg. Hu: to what extent Pretendes follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is working alone and made his career quite the West of us.
B. Zs: we do not follow their way, despite the fact that sometimes trying to compare our music with him.
Rather, we are working as a team, we trust in the presence of the other music and let it unfold.
Originally it was inevitable that compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, as many of us we started our career in your group and hence embarked another way.
Hvg. Hu: on the list of successes of Mr 2 Petõfi wings of is in the first place.
Many people heard for the first time on behalf of Zagar in relation to this song.
What Abriste Concientemente with this style towards a layer broader?
Zs. B.: not intended comprise great successes and sell these successes with our disc.
This song is something more than that.
The added at the end of the disc, trying to relax after the noise orgy of the record of the issues and heavier.
Hvg. Hu: how do you have identified the six singers?
Why precisely to them - what was the main reason?
B. Zs: the idea was to create a chorus à la gospel.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of the helpings of good voice of our own scenario musical national.
This was set up this chorus of six women - in other words, seine Kutzora Edina, Judie, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [and] Juci Németh - then was dubbed as Divas of underground.
Hvg. Hu Compusiste: what exactly the song or girls changed some things?
Zs. B.: this song there was a long time in version instrumental and when we had already all the material of the disc, still believe that something is missing.
The line attracted the song.
Yet that night recorded the song that later the learned girls.
Virtually all the first attempt in the form and incredibly spontaneous.
I remember, I very much time, but of course needed also Divas.
My voice had not worked so force.
Hvg. Hu: both in the concert and disk seems as if the girls were in the background.
There is no (except the brief only of Judy), have no role itself, sing all together and not more strongly that music, so the music not only Acompana their songs.
Also in the scenario is located in the fund.
Do you intentionally?
B. Zs: they are basically simply because of technical problems.
On the other hand deliberately did not want to distribute roles of.
The song also deals with this, on which forget earlier on our egos, which who where has been and where will, those wings, the wings of love us lifted.
It wanted to achieve that other felt that state of mind that we feel when this was born song.
Hvg. Hu: to what Dedicaste more work?
Zs. B.: in the music composition actually no rather when it comes to confuse pieces there was more difficult.
For example the Dorian Gray's in that I am playing in a piano of concert or the Rock'n'roll goes to the girls, where for a long time did not want to operate the groove and then, everything is gradually put in its place as a puzzle.
Hvg. Hu: what is your song preferred in the new disc?
Zs. B.: this is changing all the time with concerts and because I have already "unleashed" the record.
Now the Prophet is to fool, the escape from the earth and the.
A deceptive row stock exchange risks billions on his inferiority complex
an unfair Malversador.
That is how points out to its former employee, Kerviel, the giant banker French Générale, also owner of the Bank of trade Czech.
For him lost nearly five billion euros.
However, it seems rather than Kerviel was a major player who wanted to be compared to his colleagues and, of course, with good capacities.
Intuyó some time, unlike all the big banks Czechs, the crisis in the market for American mortgages.
"Is a fragile" was left to hear of their superiors, the same people who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from the answers of Kerviel according to what the media, such as the French newspaper Le Monde, is that it was a man who at the end of last year was a gain of more than EUR 1.6 billion thanks to their businesses.
Crisis not only in America
"What I wanted to do was to make money for my bank" ensures in his answers.
In fact, in the summer, managed to win during the crisis American, 500 million.
This opportunity was already come at the beginning of the year.
In February began to listen to some news about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to customers low-income or to those who in the past had difficulty with payments and that these customers would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence throughout the economy.
Kerviel not thought and opted correctly.
And then, at the end of the year their earnings outstripped the EUR 1.6 billion.
"When already earned my first 500 million not knew as notify" admits Kerviel and adds, that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation declared that had distorted records in such a way that it was not just their discovery.
Even came to mislead the heads, even if the stock market Eurex began to take an interest in their businesses.
The risk became benefit
What was afraid that was reached discover?
Rather, not.
"I thought that had won 1.6 million for the Bank and that from this simple fact, that I would be happy."
Where are brought so much willpower to risk in this way?
In my opinion should work gradually.
Came to work in Générale in the year 2000, exactly after end to study in Lyon.
Their pay annual managing between the 51 dollars.
Two years after it was Assistant row stock exchange and in 2005 row became stock exchange with a salary annual 90 000 dollars.
Yet I knew that never was going to earn as much as others.
"In my first interview in 2005 already noticed that I looked carefully.
Because of my training and also my progress professional and personal "described Kerviel researchers.
But in the short time at my entry into the company came first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of EUR 500 million.
And this was a mechanism grubbing up, and wanted more.
If they want, you are leaving
"This is like a snowball" said the police.
But it is said that the Heads knew of all this or that quite the suspected.
"While earned money, closed our eyes."
Only that, after the coup, came at the beginning of this year.
In a day lost billion euros.
After the weekend in the middle of January wanted to erase all mark.
When the Monday came to work, no longer at the Bank.
And two Dias after, the Bank announced that he had lost EUR 5 billion for his fault.
And how managed to locate him?
became suspect from their holidays.
"I chose only four Dias for the past year.
The corridor that has no holiday is a corridor that does not want that no one will take a look at his dossier "ended Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of 365 billion
The government ministers of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine of the operational programmes for the Czech Republic can achieve 14 thousand million (approximately 365 billion Crowns).
It is a question of half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Seven operational programmes will approximately 125 billion Crowns for the regions.
Companies will be able to obtain Czech around 100 billion Crowns of the programme company and innovation.
Most of the money will go to the transport, until 150 billion.
The programme of transport is the largest of the operational programmes and is up to 22% of the resources that can achieve the Czech Republic of the Fund.
This money is increasing the budget of the fund State for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.800 million kroner.
The programme of enterprise and innovation must serve to entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in innovation of business.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of methods organisational more effective.
With regard to the use of current EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the Recien that less use them.
Death twenty years for the former of Nicaragua, declared the Court
The Court of Appeals of Nicaragua declared on Thursday 20 years to the death of the former, German, which was sentenced in 2003 by the of $100 billion (almost 1 800 million kroner).
Despite this, a time following, was released from prison to move to house arrest in its finance not far from the Nicaraguan Metrópili.
It is not at all clear at the moment, according to the Agency PA that, the then head of state Central American between and 2002, back behind bars.
According to the President of the Court of Appeals, Pérez, will depend rather agents prison if left to complete its German punishment at home or if they do return to prison.
Four years ago, the Court showed as a German Traspasaba constantly money from the government to the account of a company in Pánama.
This society was fictitious and account belonged, in reality, their families and supporters more Cercanost.
Part of this money ended in the fund that German created to finance their campaign in the elections in 2001.
So we approved the budget
That is the case.
The budget of State was adopted.
Why is this particular budget?
It is the first produced by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year's budget was adopted with the support of Ssd, because what paved the Minister Sobotka and Ssd could not be allowed the not accept it.
Apart from various debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, nothing happened dramatic.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional view although the most influential, adopted calmly the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Every government begins and ends with each chapter and budget, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the means of Comunicacón and I therefore devote special attention.
The political discussions are much more interesting that the simple numbers.
The budgets of the state of the past governments of the Social Democrats suffered three defects that for this year 2008 is not possible to resolve so easily:
The first of these is the high turnout of laws compulsory, known as expenditure of the leaders who are not only pensions but also social benefits that last year before the elections were adopted by the "silent" coalition of Ssd and Ksm.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third is the deficit limit of public funding, as the budget deficit municipal and Community.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the budget deficit of the state.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the budget deficit municipal and Community.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the taxpayers' money, rates and appropriations banks, often issued, senseless, obligations with which disproportionately to their local authorities.
In recent years managed to pay these debts through the sale of mass actions energy and other networks of development that received from the state and the privatisation.
Currently do not have this resource.
If we stick to the facts only official and verified, we discover that:
Our economy, as a few years ago, is by stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, which claims Ssd.
This was the ideal opportunity for that his government an order to state finances.
However, instead the state followed.
The other, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, Economizaron much more reasonably that our Republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within the global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
That is why they are not necessary programmes mass social that, unfortunately, in recent years are Inutilmente Hincharon with measures gigantic.
And although managed to remove the incomprehensible expenditure populist approved this year before the elections, if shortly does not change the age of retirement pension reform and then really be the end of any policy in this and, governs who governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
We can say that politicians in government officials, mechanical of most of the taxpayers' money for retirement and social benefits.
That is why, this year's budget can not be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of expenditure normal expenditure of the leaders.
The deficit planned over 70 billion by the year 2008 would have been entirely unnecessary if the government last had not wasted in the last ten years what could.
We do not want that politicians governing become only in officials for this we must be patient and give this weak coalition of the government, which is aware that the state can only spend what it is capable of obtaining of taxes and duties, tranquillity for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will make the gradual achievement of a balanced budget of the state.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks British, and Canadian Swiss decided to fight together against the market crises of finance.
In the marking monetary will meet more than one hundred thousand million dollars through Licitaciónes.
In these invitations to tender banks auctioned interest rates by which are able to lend.
For example, the American EDF sent to bid 40 billion dollars, and then other twenty-four thousand million will facilitate the central banks of Europe and Swiss.
After the attacks of 11 September, this is the first time that central banks of different States agree on this process coordinated to protect and reduce the impact of the crisis of finance.
"This step must solve the greatest economic problem, namely the Contínuo growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could provide" wrote in his report for customers, Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy economic outlook group.
"This coordinated action by the central banks probably decreased the recession in the United States of 65% to 50%" added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already spent 60 billion dollars in unpaid appropriations, especially in the United States.
Economists expect still billions in losses.
"The central banks must have really fear of what awaits them still when decided to take this step," said the chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is truly evil" added.
The central banks fear that have the same problems of access to loans and that it will have to pay more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce the consumption and send to the American economy to the recession with different impacts on growth of the Economóa world.
The central banks so decided, after that were not reduce the so-called tariff Libor, tariff London that is used to lending money in the market.
This means that the banks feared constantly paid money even when the central banks of the US, Canada and the United Kingdom reduced during the autumn interest rates several times.
"Will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates" told the Reuters news agency, Greg Salvaggio of the company Tempus consulting.
Some economists is not that the step taken by the central banks will contribute to light the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem is that the fall of the property market in the US.
Klaus: the debates of environmentalists are incredible
The change global climate particularly affects the developing.
The President Václav Klaus expressed again with regard to the problem of global warming.
The criticism came now with the closure of the UN International Conference on climate change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where presented his book Azúl, not planet Green, said that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of representatives of government and non-governmental organisations but the fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality used.
"Than the debates barely are structured, are fireworks of words, substitutes of the solution to the current problems" said Klaus.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important for him, and that consequently interest.
Also expressed their joy at discover his book translated into German because as "often only I meet the caricature of my ideas."
Now the stakeholders can obtain information on their varied views.
Klaus reminded that it is not a Climatólogo but which has, in his opinion, sufficient assumptions as to write a book like this.
It is academic, with ability to continue and judge a specialised, has experience with statistics and is also economist.
At the time of the closure expressed its thought that the climate is changing all the time and its changes are normal global warming that there is no agreement between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great, serious, nor represent potential disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and Costosamente unacceptable.
As well as a man experimented with the totalitarian regimes considered unacceptable to impose the views not tried to others, what feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
The questions of the present explained repeatedly that are not against "of reasonable defenders of the environment but against the militants environmental that do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
With the same subject spoke Klaus in Vienna as long as two months in the Institute Hayek.
600 thousand people not achieved to change its card lead
to six hundred thousand drivers are the date and therefore not achieved to change its former card driving the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for change to officials them of time until the end of the year in issuing the new card.
However, the Ministry not concerned that after the new year on the roads are hundreds of thousands of drivers without the card valid.
According to traffic, the card have not changed mainly those who no longer even want to lead.
While in the peoples are announcing a rapid decline of change of cards, the offices of the metropolis full of applications and the interest in the new card has increased.
The city estimated around 2 000 customers daily.
In queues is expected a half an hour.
In Prague have still not been drawn the new card around 140 000 drivers.
The emission of a new card lasted twenty Dias.
However, it is possible to ask for issuing the card shorter within a period of five Dias.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred kroner.
Drivers necessarily must change their card and do not achieve until the end of the year, but will roads without the card applies to a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand kroner.
The police can settle the infringement with a reprimand.
If a breach administrative the fine will rise to EUR 2.5 kroner.
According to the information previous could receive a fine that person that it is not going nowhere.
Could pay presumably until 30 000 kroner.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to enter moderately fines of thousand kroner, at the most.
According to the of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of thousand kroner not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving licence is a document in which people can decide whether we want to or not.
It is not the identity card that every person must have valid.
People who do not want to lead should hand over the driving licence.
Enough to bring it or send it by post certificate to local offices.
At the end of the year are no longer valid the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993.
However, drivers must gradually be changing the other types of driving licence.
People with the document between 1994 until 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to these are Hanzelka 2.6 million documents more.
The Court reduced the death to the detectives accomplices of Berdych
The Expolicias Josef Opava and Petr Koaík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will move between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided as expiry final reduction of penalties, the first to a year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the Departamente Praguense against organised crime them would fall, in principle, between 14 and 12 years.
Against today's decision no longer can be used, it is only through the repeal by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused but he hopes firstly the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this in other processes has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
Can not receive more.
In January, the Court of district recognised participation in the robbery of 19 people and the High Court, today, reversed to 16 of them.

According to the Court judge provincial Ostrava was the first to mark used the Kingdom of Walachei but the project was created for many years by Tomái Harabii with whom the actor worked.
Polívka was not tabled today to the oral procedure.
According to his lawyer probably not the cause is over and his client recourse.
"The case is that Mr Harabii and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka" said after the process, the lawyer Polívka.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Walachei, everyone is the image of the actor and comical.
The same idea has also Harabii.
"We have been following us about ten years of work.
Search for money and invention of activities, "he said.
For him, the cause of the case is in the money.
"After years I have noticed that the project is successful and that it could also something.
They want to live as parasites of our work "added.
A lucrative business
According to the Court marks the Kingdom of Walachei was first used by Polívka in its programme of television.
In 1993 was crowned with player Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not a question of into the creation of a Kingdom fictitious.
A few years later to Harabii thought publishing the passport of the Kingdom of Walachei.
From that comical origin was a business and a lucrative business activity which Harabii created after the Kingdom of society Walachei.
In 1997, Polívka agreed in the use of its name and signing in passports and even offered their holders discounts to the Vistantes of his farm and assistants to their performances.
Who sit in the throne?
The today also found that Harabii only used a simple idea that Polívka issued in the stage for their own benefit business.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Walachei" said.
He went on to say, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabii and his team which is devoted to this completely.
Cooperation, between the today Descompuestas parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabii organised for Polívka the crowning official Vsetín.
Since then began to be conflicts between Polívka and Harabii whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "King I, the elected by always".
The main role in the Kingdom, through Harabii led to the singer Jarmila Uláková, as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka presented an accusation against Harabii and their society that so far has been rejected by the Court.
Something in clear might bring in the dispute, the tournament by the throne with their princesses, which is already preparing Harabii.
From it should leave the new king.

Should be something like the way of King towards Moravia.
The King would have to be elected by a specific date.
Even Mr Polívka can stand "added Harabii.
Test Peugeot 207 Sw 1.6 Vti: overcome prejudices
The truth is that I have never liked too the Peugeotu 206.
Their characteristics of motion were never nothing special, the quality of the box manoeuvre changes, and also the product could be characterised as below the average.
But now exists on the market his successor, Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
This so-called Sw is a little more advanced and to me, because I can only better.
When the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, of the area of the masthead in the back seat.
But that would be the only complaint because the bodywork of the means to this end, which I will not suffer before the two metres in length.
The Bush by the World
step by the internal quickly so as not to repeat it too.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor tunnel central.
Here assessed more the invention of design although the Auto / seems rather elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times that of short seats and.
Unlike the also 206 model, the direction lateral has improved considerably.
What about the area?, and here can feel how have grown measures of the bodywork.
In the disappears shortage of this area in the masthead.
Luggage to boot
But the main thing in this car is its boot.
This must assess it as very accessible (thanks to the Portón back) and a storage well distributed.
The dead spaces equipped with rubber posed by an ideal solution.
Not bother, and can be extended to the point of subject objects heavy.
In the deposit.
According to the tables, in basic regime has a capacity of 428 litres what in comparison with the competition is more of an average value.
But not in comparison with the vehicle more of the same type sold in the Czech Republic, the Koda Fabia.
If we compare the 207 Sw with the new generation of the model of Mladá Boleslav, that the Peugeot falls behind with their perceptible 52 litres.
On holiday abroad or in placing the value of the child is critical.
But if I had to say something positive then I have to give you the floor that it is quite level after the of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our car was equipped with a Encedido injection of four valves on a capacity of 1.6 l. And a force of 88 Kw.
To tell the truth and that is how it should seem a 1600 that Menospreciara to the family five doors.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, it must momentum.
If I compare this with the era of Ikoda of then that it seemed as if he were Taponado by a rag, I can say that with this can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for everyone.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have a vehicle equipped gracefully and with an engine very good.
The basic price of the car with lighting of injection of 1400 by 329.900 kroner, there is room.
Our aggregates make from 410.900 kroner, what is already too.
The kind premium already reached other 80 000 kroner.
Only that Tendriamos still airbag in the air conditioning, automatic, automatic, windows automated ...
In other words, the car with all of all, costs 531.900 kroner.
It is much, but have supplements of the team in the Fabia and come to a number rather similar.
Now there is only decide on which of the two marks.

In schools English attend children of Eastern Europe and that is why the local people more afraid of changes in schools.
The integration of the East Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even the British schools recorded cases where conflicts between immigrants and the children of the natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of the children of Eastern Europe in the British schools is all very well illustrated in the city of northern Kent where are beginning to grow conflicts between the natives and migrants Slovaks.
Discussions, Estorsión and Broncas between students have already reached even the own parents.
Things have come so far that the police Chatmam arrested a woman Slovak that was hitting sticks to a student of ten years with a yardstick Green.
In their defence said that the girl was insult to his son with insults tone racist.
The police had to act even after an attack by two girls minors against a migrant Slovak.
I girls Agasajaron with insults racist and I jettisoned stones.
"When we were going home, a boy approached towards us to the bus and began to biting ourselves.
When I told him that we stop it made the attempt to launch ourselves apples and pears, and then fell trousers and we showed its back "described another unpleasant incident in order to the times, the mother of the student Slovak.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the native even appointed to the conflict with the emigrants from Eastern Europe and fight for survival.
The cases already mentioned earlier, show us as the atmosphere in schools English is beginning to be fairly tense.
In Britain there are registered 70 000 Slovaks who came here to work.
Approximately 30 000 students Slovaks attending schools English.

The choice of the status quo

Three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin them today to send a message to the voters televised on public agencies, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
It does as leader of the list for the United Russia, the party Pro-Kremlin whose victory is proving overwhelming.

Whatever, to the legislative elections and the presidential power outgoing triumph.
It is a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of homo Sovieticus, do not feel masters of their own destiny", estimated the sociologist Goudkov, Director of the Centre independent Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, of State University of St. Petersburg, goes back further: civil society is delayed in this country Cristianizado five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the Community delayed the training of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine restored the model of a state paternalistic, perfectly acceptable to the population because this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a true confession economic", estimated María Lipman, Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "give up on its own will on personal responsibility" of those who briefly had shown after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What reflect?"
The phenomenon up all sections of society, including the world affairs.
And the elite administrative intends to preserve the status quo: 65 (governors of each 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the United Russia..
The new freedoms imported from the West are often Sinónimas of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of that the Russians do not vote not by extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a professor of age of 54 years: "Why reflect?
What those in power are not too bad, why change them? "

Will there be the end of the year on the stock exchange? experts, divided by the crisis'
Subprime'a less than five weeks to dismiss the closure of the exercise, investors are already hands in the hope that the traditional the end of the year.
This year, however, the experts are not so clear that it will happen.
Banif believes that "from the point of view, statistical December on the stock market is often behaviour positive.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, more even because in the current context, the uncertainties lurking in markets, at least in the short term ".
Although they are not in favour of the stock market lame Carrerilla in recent weeks of the year, these experts suggest that "the stock market it is claimed by the existence of liquidity prepared to invest, given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, particularly the bond, affected by the effect flight towards values of quality both in the sections long as in the short."
I therefore believe that the stock market will have a behaviour rather lateral, not exempt from volatility "above all that is not known the impact of the likely fall in rates of the Fed, given the high level of oil and the danger of stimulating tensions inflationary."
Javier district, responsible for sales in Spain, is in line with that is not good time to venture to say that there will be.
"Is not the thing for many joys", ensures the expert.
The ibex has lost nearly 4% since the maximum set on 8 November when the index closed in the 15.945,7 points.
Yet not all the experts have this vision so negative.
John Solana, analyst of Intermoney, believes that the ibex 35 could close the year closer to the 16 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and to the traditional contributions to the pension schemes that are produced every year at this time.
However, the expert clarifies that things will be something different this year already believes that is the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not believe that the volatility will affect the tendency of the market.
For its part, Frederick Olucha, analyst of Inversis Bank, values that we are close to technical standards and "Therefore we could see a rebound of the rate that could be driven depending on the news reaching us with regard to the consequences of the crisis in the credit market."
The analyst confident that they are positive.
Analysts agree in choosing the values that will be responsible for the ibex towards new heights maximum.
Solana, of Intermoney, "says that this year up to the great values."
The expert included in the portfolio to the two big banks and some construction "because when it comes to date, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
While, Frederick Olucha, of Inversis Bank guarantees that increases will come from the hand of the banking and the industrial sector.
The construction also be able to benefit from this, should be given.
"ACP brings several months recovering positions and we hope that other construction as Ferrovial and FCC follow the same path", explains the expert.
Consumption cyclical be player in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the season sales Christmas.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological also will very well but not in this case there is a lot of representation in the market Spanish.
Five times in seven year
Over the last seven years, in only two occasions December has been a month.
The real the end of the year we lived in 2003, exercise in which stock markets out of the crisis caused by the puncture the technological bubble.
This year, in which the ibex 35 recovered a 28,17%, December showed a rise of the 6,68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth year running gains (at the moment the ibex up a 8,36% since January) and count on your if it succeeds in the end of the year.

The former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of government and the President of the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general election and be President of Congress in the case of the Socialists to win the general election.
This was announced in press conference Secretary of the organization of the PSOE, José white, and the very Bono, after the meeting that has kept this afternoon in the seat of this federal party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former Minister "because it is important to have the best' in political life and Bono" is among the best'.
Moreover, said that "yes" It seems that the political Manchego will be the candidate of the Socialist Group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists expire at the next elections.
Bono would replace as President of Congress to Manuel Marín, that issued on 15 November its decision not to stand for the next general election and abandon his career in the active policy to take up the fight against climate change in the university level.
The former Minister has acknowledged that the President of the government has continued to insist that return to the forefront policy since the abandon two years ago.

And more a leader of the movement that is as Prime Minister Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than of Islamist terrorism and intends to sign a "new contract with the world."
This approach requires explain why the action, or inaction, of his government have contributed decisively to Spain to lead the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who is responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors and why there has been its government, that of the contract with the planet, it has not prevented.
Moreover, required to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spanish what measures it intends to take to slow down climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits citizens must be changed, what individual and collective energy savings be forced to do, what economic consequences will take.

The measures against climate change, the real action are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening for companies and individuals.
Until the penny of petrol suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that has been quick to deny it.
In other words, it comes to save the planet with the nothing, with pure propaganda, with slogans devoid of any real consequence.
With phrases, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With contracts with the planet, that Mr so useful for election campaigns that neither discussed nor complaint or requires, but the rallies and inspires tenderness.

Sure what I should be?
motor insurance, which covers the driver to possible claims, is a major expenditure that depend on various factors such as age, gender, age of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of, among others.
Have the car is only the beginning.
And that is that, choose appropriate motor insurance is even more difficult to choose the model of vehicle.
First of all we must be clear what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This compromise takes the form of a contract, which states that the insurance company receives the value of the premium agreed in exchange for responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is laid down in view of various factors such as age, gender, age of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to assure him or the use of, among others.
Insurance companies establish their prices according to the statistics, so that most likely to have an accident, greater share to pay.
It is for that reason that both the age of 25 as women have to pay premiums lower, as the statistics show that have a lower rate of accidents due to its care.
Also, lists, companies have come to the conclusion that people married tend to have fewer accidents that drivers singles.
The use of it to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus in the likelihood of have some kind of.
By increasing the frequency.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That is why, for the driver must take a good look at the situation to choose the best suited to its profile.
Here the variables most significant to choose one or other types of insurance, so that it can, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insured, offered a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 years are with various disadvantages when it comes to take out insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced experience in driving and the age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well secured is a sure to any risk, there are other options economic.
Drivers more cautious can opt for a any risk with franchise, so that we obtain the coverage of insurance to any risk but at a price more feasible.
This kind of Convention would mean that the customer pay a part of the amount of the disaster.
"The part of the amount of the sinister provided by the customer is Preestablecerá depending on the value of the premium, which will be the lower the highest amount", specifies Luis Noguera, maximum responsible in Spain of Europe, first mediator insurance online.
Another option is a safe third expanded, so that the customer is guaranteed protection against the damage caused to third, but not before the caused in their own car.
Moreover, would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A Council.
If you are under the age of 25 years trying to be careful and avoid the sinister as far as possible, as this would have an impact on the bonus, can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction tariff on the basis that has the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge tariff on that basis.
"Subsidies and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of this.
If the company has had a good year can afford to increase subsidies, "clarifies Noguera.
The Gaza last 25 years drivers are easier to take out insurance, because the rate of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, the most desirable is to take out any risk with franchise.
"Normally young people can not make use of the experience gained previously in use in an accident, and even in the driving", ensures in Spain the director of the European company, which adds that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once it is now the' fear of the new'.
However, if the customer is married but still does not have children is preferable to negotiate a sure to any risk, provided that their economic situation is it possible, of course.
For its part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest number of accidents, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one to any risk with franchise (can be of EUR 300), or, when it has a high level of bonus, one to third extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"Conducting a driving more relaxed and have the greatest purchasing power to afford to take a number of franchise more" ruling Luis Noguera.
For retired people is commendable insurance to any risk with franchise (and this of EUR 150), or one to third extended when it has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that motor insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver to possible claims, but also because it represents an important expenditure, which is why it is essential to study properly insurance that suits us in our personal situation.
The Celtic seeks in Milan a point worth the eighth

The whole of Gordon Strachan could serve it even a defeat in order to qualify if the Shakhtar not wins, but can not be entrusted to because equal nine points the move is for Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other mourning direct.
Thus, the Milanistas will try to you one day to the Scots, who rely on eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and succession, after that were precisely defeated in this round the last campaign with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) After the 0-0 of the IDA.

New fears about the gas between Russia and Ukraine
The dispute by increasing the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk of affecting the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
The majority of gas exported by Russia to the European Union is directed via Ukraine, so each between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay transit charges higher.
A dispute previous last year reduced supplies to the EU States.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow wine with the Ukrainian Government and the Russian State, owner gas monopoly Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money to be paid Ukraine by Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom declared that will become more to Ukraine, because it is committed to pay 50% extra in 2008 over gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that Ukraine could be paid a 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important journeys to gas during the talks" said the Finance Minister Ukrainian Anatoly Kinakh to Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not be linked to our arguments on the levels of the transit charges [] to Western Europe via Ukraine."
The last major dispute over gas between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off the supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which rose rapidly prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the supply of the EU.
Russia is the largest gas reserves of much of the world, but it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply of Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations of Central Asia.

The authorities in health Scottish declare that currently have 1.161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses

Climate of Venus can give an idea of the future of the earth
Venus may have been once an appropriate place for life, declared scientists yesterday.
The data of a ship European space in orbit showed the planet more like a twin of the land of what had been noted previously.
Venus is closer to the planet Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy orbits similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made the land, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the erosion air for solar radiation and the rotation solar slower sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the temperature of the surface is sufficient to melt lead and it is being eroded by the storms of rays.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus, who has studied the planet for one year, provides a picture of how the earth could develop changes catastrophic because of the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the department of physical at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the mission Venus, states: "why the climate in Venus is so different from the land, when they are two planets so similar.
"Our new data make it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as the land, possibly with a habitable environment makes millions of years."

But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican Party for the elections next year.
We do not know exactly how producers of CNN, that Co-patrocinan the debate, chose the videos of Youtube to show the candidates for candidates.
But the first half an hour of debate, the longer devoted to a single issue, focusing on the immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful clichés for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters that dial when listen ideas that I Agradaran: issuers peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with arguments extremists.
Exchanges of words strongest of night occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the pioneer national, and Mr Romney, which has been leading in the crucial polls and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of Romney because it was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
Mr attacked Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts recruiting illegal immigrants to work at home.
Both responded aggressively when I asked whether some candidate could support a "Amnesty" (allowing illegal regularise their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
The candidates minors as Duncan hunter, a congressman Californian, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman of Colorado, managed to agree with the issue.
None has the floor to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both alerted on the issue of immigration before the other.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share views: increased surveillance at borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This cliché, together with the fear of toys toxic of China and other concerns about the foreign aid, Republicans to forget, or minimise, divisions between the Liberals and Conservatives Christians.
But the debate was transformed into uneasy when other issues.
To Mr Guiliani was asked why he had supported the arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed on whether the immersion in water should be considered a torture.
Someone asked whether the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led to Mr Giuliani to encounter towards the position that while the Bible was his book favorite, did not believe literally in the history of the Jonás and whale.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, firstly in the most recent poll, thanks to your conservatism Christian longstanding - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pushed to respond if Jesus would be in favour, the laughed by saying that Jesus was too intelligent to be candidate in elections.
The race still unusually open.
Mr Huckabee increases in, coincidentally with fundraising campaigns of the liberal rum Paul, and their statements by the heated debate on Wednesday.
These two have come from the bottom, because both sides of the party not reached agreement on the candidate most famous and traditional.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and forcefully with a message winner on the greatness of America, satisfying on both sides of the Party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in that sink; but also emerging
As the political scandals are still in England, this is not particularly interesting.
Do not seem to have been sold influences, nor is Exhorbitantes Auditors hotel in Paris, or Chupadas of fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the Party of Labour Government English, of more than 650 GBP (1.3 billion), by almost four years using names false, and that the party not denounced.
Two months ago, when Prime Minister avoided call a choice, insult the British intelligence declaring that opinion polls not in its decision, the hope was that would provide a strong government and efficient.
But instead, as Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat Heads with ingenuity growing, because the dreaded Mr Brown has gone from being Stalin to be Mr bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in problems, showed the weaknesses regulatory and poverty trial in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has made the business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authorities lost 25 million of personal data that revealed shoddy work administrative inconceivable.
A trio of general retired launched a mutiny in the House of Lords, protesting against the cuts in military spending: be Ministers of the armed forces, is called for, a part-time employment.
It is now up to the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watts, the Secretary-General labour (and previous complicit) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr Brown walk irrevocably towards the end.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People do not believe as politicians, but usually suspended its disbelief when a new batch takes control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister can not improve matters, you will not remains for a long time, this suspension is of more: civil servants are beginning to fail; the cabinet ministers are set out; the press seeking bad news; and the government is on the defensive and not focus.
On the one hand, the position of Brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders can not defend themselves on the grounds that is new.
Even if I wanted to renege on Tony Blair, was its lieutenant higher.
The problems of the Northern Rock and tax registration of authority, are related to the decisions that Brown did as Chancellor of the purse.
And even when it is not directly involved in the setbacks of Blairish - or "effective for partners," research funding of political parties - voters can assume that if it has.
However, the situation of Mr Brown is not as bad as it seems.
The gaffes are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr bean, no one is dead, nor has it been cheated directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what trends of course Stalinists by Mr Brown have promised always: a government reliable and brutal.
The new political scandal of donations is a case in point.
Mr Abrahams, comparing their donations with gifts of charity, says that he does not want public recognition for your indulgence.
This may be so, but the decision not making it.
Laws against the anonymity for large contributors politicians is clear and there is a clear right: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr Watts, who said to know of the agreement of Mr Abraham, and that this was not illegal, obviously face Mendlesohn, head of raising funds to which were asked on donations in October.
But Mr Brown not so far is involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these actions, although the bulk of payments was done after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has made half of the work.
Has been quick to condemn his party by break the law, but be diluted in decision-making on a matter of family, a committee of inquiry into the matter - driven by a judge, to a large extent, and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been raped, is a matter of the police.
Moreover, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, and to find a head permanent and independent for the committee on standards in public life, because it has not had one for the past six months, and in addition to push for a genuine reform of the financing of parties.
This will require a hard work cooperative Labour's with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the financial situation special has with the trade unions - bitter measures to a partisan as Mr Brown.
But he has to deal with some facts partisan.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way they can move to victory is to act with an impeccable probity and sound competition.
Sharks cards
The crisis of mortgages subprime is infecting the American market of credit cards?
When there are blood in water, it is natural that fins Dorsales Naden around.
Today that the American market of housing is in crisis, predators have their eyes placing on the market of the country of credit cards.
Analysts in Goldman Sachs estimate that the losses in credit cards can reach the 99 billion dollars if the crisis of mortgages subprime other forms of appropriations consumption.
Signs of infection already are.
There is an increase in both the charges of cards as crime rate, measuring the proportion of the balances that have not been cancelled or that are more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that has taken from 1.4 million in their business of financing to the consumer American, partly because of the weakness of the providers of cards.
However, it is too early to panic.
Late payment and crime are in low levels.
According to's, a rating agency, the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost one percentage point below average historic.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by factors technical.
A change in the American law of bankruptcy of people (2005) gave rise to a sharp decline in applications of bankruptcy, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore of late payments) would be to grow again, or it may be that the conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also brings sound rates of payment, which show how much of their debts paid by consumers every month.
And confidence in credit cards and values supported by assets is quite firm, despite the paralysis in other areas financial.
Dennis Moroney of Towergroup, a signature research, predicts that volumes of emissions for the year 2007 will be close to a 25% higher than the last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between mortgages subprime and the market of credit cards certainly exists: consumers like to bear the debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are ending.
But the issuers of the credit card look more the flow of liquidity values assets, so that prices fall Accionan not necessarily a change in the capacity worthy of borrowers.
Can even work to outflank issuers.
The incentives for consumers continue to pay off the mortgage decreasing if property worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the debt repayment of the card rises in the list of priorities.
Issuers of cards can also respond rapidly and flexibly to the conditions that difficult mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering balances creditors.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a Retasación rapid asset.
"We are not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all loans," says Gary Perlin, head of finance capital one.
If a sudden infection of the subprime in the market of credit cards is unlikely, the risks of a decline are much more sustained real.
If home prices are lower and a credit crunch drive to America to the recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a future stronger.
We must continue to monitor these fins Dorsales.
British bankers convicted in Enron affair
three British bankers who went to trial by their responsibility for fraud with the former head of the office of Enron, financial Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven charges of fraud by Coludir with in an operation financial secret in 2000 to enrich at the expense of employees.

But during the hearing before the judge Ewing Werlein Jr. District or. S, each was sentenced as guilty of Colución in fraud.

The collapse did lose thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension schemes.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth lay and the previous chief executive Jeffrey were responsible prisoners the years past for their roles in the collapse of the company.

Surgery "shoddy work" could be a cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before action thanks when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "a bit healthier" and was how an ambulance rose by white Cape Cod, two doors below in avenue West Scott.
Suddenly, appeared a car from the patrol of the police.
And after another.
"So I saw raise the ambulance," said Mr Livingston, supervisory restaurant, that day on Wednesday.
"There was when I knew that someone had died."
The authorities were able to that women dead was Arroyo, 41 years, the assistant director of the department of the police Newark.
Now researchers are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure carried out by a surgeon plastic unauthorised, that is not yet identified by the police, but who work in the House of the 212 of the West Av. Scott.
The authorities still do not determine what caused the death of Mrs Arroyo, but expect to the test although the results will not be available until a few weeks. This will help resolve the mysterious death that is sorry the ranks senior police Newark.
Mrs Arroyo was assistant director of the police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and their voice was family to many in the department.

The actions on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market hoping that the Fed Calmara conditions of credit with cuts in interest rates, which increased with the tranquillisers comments by the Vice-President of the Central Bank of the US.
The stock markets are Aflojaron in London, New York and through Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, stating that EU policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic" to respond to the tension continued financial markets.
In an effort to reassure clear markets in the midst of growing signs of pockets of credit, Mr Kohn said that the recent turmoil was "partly reversed by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October."
If the upward trend, would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, said Kohn.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh in capital markets of the US and to make further interest rate cuts, to stabilise the conditions of credit.
The remarks also helped to calm Wall Street in the midst of bad news for the economy of the US, as sales of homes that reached record lower in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil was marked by a warning of bear Stearns, bank of investment that 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of their total workforce, in an overall reduction in costs to offset the loss of their investments in sub-prime mortgages of the US.
It is to be hoped that only 20 of these posts come to London, where the Bank employs 1 500 people.
In New York, the average industrial of the Dow Jones rose in 331 points, or 2.55%, to the closure to 13.289.40, while the S & P 500 went up a 2.65%.

England takes view the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who is to strike at the No 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, does Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should decide?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the President of the selection that is in loan - with that title particular at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, Director of the England, is beginning to fill offers to become dials national, and if not, in one part time.
The not succeed in the sixth place of beats be unfortunate, but life often is unjust and sport also.
It is not easy to throw what makes a man at the top of their profession, while another never goes further than the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than by capacity.
Not only in the choice is difficult, because we need trials that always end being subjective.
Is it the right time to Bopara is lifted?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be done in another aspect if, say John Edwards or "tubby" Banerjee, two bright young executives with good degrees and are familiar with the business, would have to be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who is to say what a good level for a player, unless we will be given the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
The figures naturally have a major influence on decisions, but that also have opportunities.
Within a team, a player has to catch the eye of the captain at the same time to take a wicket and a Bateador to achieve opportunities to change the order if it wants to have impact as player one day.
But to catch the eye of the Seleccionadores is more complicated.
There were many which improved the last season, for example, James Anderson, surely played in the first test even if Stephen Harmison pleads for fit and bowls like wind in the networks.
Anderson took 32 Wickets first-class in 33 careers by each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both had their moment high and can expect more of them.
The games of Shah or Bopara in the stadium Asgiriya can be only a matter of opinion.
The option can be broken or the career of a man, or may mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, batty played in each test and did so well in the first, with 5 Wickets and 40 useful careers, but it was Paul Collingwood, to fight to be established at the same time who came to become a major player, and despite enter a double% against Australia in Australia, may yet be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, following a discussion more in today's sitting in the stadium Asgiriya, they will continue their instincts of conservation and encourage the more experience of Shah above the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There is a case for both.
In favour of Shah is a brilliant and valuable proof of principles of 88 in Bombay, 32 hundreds of first-class against only 6 Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent Antedecentes against Bowling.
But Shah was only ten careers in its two shifts in May against West Indian in proof in, home as player Middlesex, and that caused an immediate rejection of the Selectores when Vaughan called instead for the next meeting, seemed to have taken of its batting something of élan which in Bombay.
On the contrary, the team of Essex has in swords.
It for nothing in the field of and its attitude was summarised as when turned his vehicle at an exhibition for the sponsor of cars of England, Volkswagen.
Suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was to draw your Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his fellow Member of the team that was looking to the distance, to say: "do excitement that?".
Bopara is the best player, including its is slippery happens to have effects on their stake that seem to meet it, because Batea with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choose the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give to Bopara its opportunity, this does not mean that Shah not, as suggested the leaves of tea, it is he who played here this weekend.
Buses bring to the refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees of Syria began to reach Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were not effective, without stretches of the visa and who hoped that the city back on its feet.
Some even had turned to combat militants that led out of their homes.
In the station buses of Mansour, even before the advent of 800 people from Damascus in a convoy official government made up of a dozen buses, terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan had turned into private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after that killed many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah Al-qubaisi, medical Sunni.
"I returned today by what I saw in the TV and what I have read in the newspapers, on what has happened in Baghdad and now it is safe".
"Say that the Mahdi Army left to kill people", States, referring to the Shiite militia of the militant religious cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, that he ordered his troops a cessation.
Qassim to the Atwani, Shiite 38 years and Professor in the area of Sunni Amariyah, once again with his two children because it was impossible to renew their visa in Syria because the regime does not want to the Iraqi people working in their country.
Its neighbours Shi'a in Amariyah what to say that a force ally of us helped bring Al-Qaeda outside their bastion in the west of the capital, and to come back.
One of the newcomers of Jordan was the head of a tribe Sunni and Shiite who had been driven from their homes in Sleikh North of Baghdad, by an attack of grenades, after which urged the citizens to stand up against Al-Qaeda.
He had been to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends I called and I was told that had begun a militia Al-Qaeda in Sleikh and that they needed of my support and that of my colleagues."
"I have therefore again today," declared Sabaah Alu Obeidi, of 62 years.
Many said to be attracted by the calm growing in the capital from that of the US troops Afianzaran groups of "public concerned", armed and working in cooperation with the military us to defend their neighborhoods.
But many declared again by refusing visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis were established in recent years.
Al-samarrai, 51 years and father of three children, gave voice to the suspicion common between exiles, that Nouri Al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shiite, asked the Syrian government impose restrictions on visas of refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe have fled the country because of the sectarian of death.
"We were well until Al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to the Iraqi people, to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni.
"I can not believe in a government which supports the criminals who fire my home that made it".
Part of the reason for an end to the violence is that the Sunnis have been expelled from areas Shi'a and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There is the fear that a sudden wave of refugees will arise again tensions sectarian and start the fight.
The small, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even conspicuous by the international orientation of its universities.
As throughout the country, the Sarlandeses lack only a field education.
"Yesterday explained by 50th time to a not Sarlandés that we are not Franseses" - that was the motorcycle ironic on themselves of the smallest federal State for its Cencuentenario.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a major role in the education system of that in a study of the Institute of the German economy (Iw) called "Bildungsmonitor" held the fifth place.
In this way, the universities traditionally have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of was in 1948 by the Franseses.
So far the students can end here his career university with two or three Dipolmas.
As a result, the of foreign students is high, of 15, 6 by hundreds.
However, the number of students from the Saar is greater than the average in the universities. Many of them do not have a Bacillerato.
"It takes advantage of the system of vocational education," says Plünnecke, the Experte of education sector in the Institute of the German economy (Iw).
More than five young people do their baccalaureate at school professional. It is that is points 7% above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the range of possibilities for education Profesional-académica is very broad.
The offer of careers double, in relation to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite the vocational training practice and a growing demand, the number of graduates in science engineering fell by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the education ministry of forced universities to do more publicity for the specialities in science engineering.
"After the first PISA study, carried out some reforms in schools of general education," says a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
So the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
To ensure that children start as soon as possible to study the last year of the project called "Kita-jahr", this has no cost. Meanwhile, this model imitate the other Estades federal.
The comparison with the next studies show whether has increased the performance of pupils.
According to the report Pisa of 2003, the number of pupils behind in development school Desminuyó of 29 to 20%.
But, in general, not improved much as other federal states.
In Bavaria, pupils calculate know better.
For displeasure of the Sarlandeses, the report Pisa not compares the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this area could achieve good results.
Despite the fact that the Sarlandeses are not French, the language of the neighbours is a secondary education institutes.

With this reform is quite could extend their power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the Desición taken by Uribe by withdrawing the mandate of Chávez in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in that it was the release of the hostages.
The Sunday Chávez criticising said that the decision taken Uribe offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is much talk about Chávez.
A new tone of so-called cause feeling in the country: "Why do not you Callas?", is the phrase that have already unloaded half a million people.
This sentence the gave the King of Spain that was annoyed by the continuing Interrupcciones by left-wing populists in the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the reduction in wages real threat to the Germans.
According to a prognosis, this year a reduction in wages real threat to employees German despite a strong economy.
The experts have a host of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Foundation Hans Böckler, German employees should have in 2007 with a Cuenta-salario real lower than the previous year.
"That is to blame for the weak evolution of salaries, the increase in the value added tax and the Estirón of food prices and energy", informed the newspaper "Bildt" Gustav Horn of the Institute of macroeconomics and research of economic cycles.
The new burdens of the unemployment insurance can fall to employees.
The Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper' Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung "that, given the current situation, the intention to reduce the burden of unemployment insurance a 3.3% to move from one year to the next, it is fair and reasonable.

On Tuesday was made public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the area of food and the sector derived from oil reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, these are increasing 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the land.
Despite its atmosphere is not suited to life, Venus is more like the planet Earth, which so far had not been raised. The European probe "Venus" discovered rays in the atmosphere and Remolinos in the Poles, the same people who are also in winter on earth.
For the past three decades researchers had the suspicion that might exist rays in Venus.
But now the probe European has brought new evidence: discovered electromagnetic waves on the brink of the atmosphere. In Venus rays Cayen of heights of 54 kilometres of a cloud behind and other, account Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles to "the scientific journal Nature."
According to the famous model of the origin of the life of Urey-miller, the rays caused life on earth: the storms could have provoked reactions in the ocean that, for its part, would have led to the amino acids that are the building blocks of life.
In Venus is not the case: if one day would have life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of development ", explains are Solomon of the institution Carnegie Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus life: there can be no pressure air is almost 100 times higher than in the land and on the surface temperatures reign of 500° C, in such a way that can be achieved temperatures below zero.
"Possibly Venus is a twin" diabolical "of the land, but it is still a twin Russell," he said.
The main objective of the mission "Venus" is to respond to the question as to why Venus, very similar to the land for its size, and has had a development so different.
As since the 1990s there was no specific missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-express" in November 2005 was a very important step for research of Venus.
Recent research results which will be presented in many articles of "nature", according to the opinion of researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"This Desmuestra also that planets neighbours have more common characteristics with the land of the assumed that", reports that.
Despite the already well-known winds stormy in the North Pole, researchers found in the region polar South also a Vórtice made up of the clouds that tour faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of flows of wind in the high strata atmospheric land of the Poles, according to describes a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of special and physical space.
The second world of the solar system has the mass almost equal to the land and with their diameter Equatorial of 12 000 kilometres is almost as large.
This planet also known as star of Alba or star evening orbit around the sun almost 225 days.
But his period of rotation is slower: a day in Venus amounts to 243 days on earth.
Although Venus with their surface temperatures 460 degrees and with its pressure air of 92 bars not resembles a lot to land, scientists are based on the basis that both planets had been formed under the same conditions.
In the two planets had been patchwork water on earth stayed in the oceans, but in Venus in the universe.
While on earth carbon dioxide had become stones of carbon in Venus form the majority of the atmosphere.
Defended the rally Merkel with Dalai Lama.
, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties on the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellor.

"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance of the course traditional of the One China policy.
China also knows, "he said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democrat Party), had shown indirectly its displeasure by receiving Dalai Lama and because of this was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its policy ineffective in the external field.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellor caused great misunderstandings in relations Chino-alemanas.
Thus, the Chinese Government not only withdrew the invitation to peer Steinbrueck (Social Democrat Party), the Finance Minister of Germany, but also, according to information sources of the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, head of the Chinese Government, called on the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognise this receiving Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Saying the position of China, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that Europe's politicians were given to the religious leader of the Tibetans in its official position.

Schaeuble warns that there will be riots such as those in France.
Battles with the police on the streets, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be riots as was the case of France.
The Federal Minister means that we must do everything possible to ensure that the social dissatisfaction in Germany will not be moved to the streets.
Were made barricades, the vandals fired with the police rifles: after serious riots by young people in France, the Federal Minister of Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We must set in that social problems of our country do not take the form violent".
"We have to be taken seriously," he said in the newspaper' Neue Presse ", published in Hanover.
Not all young people work in constant change of social reality.
The federal state, the federal state and local authorities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, said Schaeuble.
That is concerned not only to the integration of immigrants.
"Of the Summit of integration until the Conference of Islam: all this is beginning to bear fruit."
It is still early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the suburbs Germans do not have the same problems Edificatorios and sociological as in France.
Young people serious unrest in the streets with the police to the north of Paris the last night.
In Tolouse also burned cars and public buildings.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish community in Germany called for greater efforts of the Federal Government to integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of a copier effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the rate of unemployment among young people under the age of 25 is above average.
We must ensure that there is more posts of vocational training.
Kolat stresses: "We must give a perspective young people."
The President of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France "there is a great social control in families", greater than the country French.
Moreover, the majority of young people of foreign origin does not want to destroy what they had built here their parents.
Kolat view: "but nevertheless, we have to be careful."
"must be given the opportunity to young people to receive faster a job or vocational training."
In the meantime the night in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-bel went peacefully.
Hundreds of police officers took part in the action, with a helicopter lighthouses territory.
The responsible authorities informed three arrests, as well as of rubbish and burned cars.
Since the day before a team of almost 1 000 police is looking of safety.
Having seen a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take measures rigorous until it is needed.
On Monday night to Tuesday around 80 policemen were wounded by unrest in Villiers-le-bel.
The riots continued Tolouse.
The disturbance began by a traffic accident on Sunday, which killed two young people.
According to information provided by the public prosecutor's office, the death of young people was not because of the police.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The action very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its final point and that we should not expect nothing more of it.
But in which country live really Chancellor?
After his desperately action, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House must be said: it does not live in the country that would have to be governed by it.
With regard to the reproach made for having devoted repeatedly actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a phrase.
He said that this would be a way and thus showed note that did not want to understand what interests critics.
In the lower house was stated very clearly expresses all that this criticism was right.
It could not be feel or a minimum interest, nor any kind of feeling for the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke was presented in this way: a policy very high fleeing in foreign policy and stay there without achieve anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: much praised itself for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how they should take place here these goals in matters of climate.
In general, this way of praise itself - for two years the leader of the Party of the Union Demócratocristiana has not been able to allow such modesty.
Because insists on expressions to seek a boost to the people.
In this way and harms its public image by design pragmatic with which solve the problems without going about the bush.
But in the Kingdom of Angela Wolke internal problems are Aparencias of little value.
Does the child poverty and the concerns for low-wage workers?
The only is dedicated to talk about this issue using prayers subordinate.
It is impressive how often is wrong to speak when it comes to supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a phrase more or less good.
It is beginning to encounter "as if it had been in a territory unknown", in the case of more concrete information.
The section attacks.
The two favourite, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in a heated debate of presidential Republicans of Youtube and must now fear only one candidate of the outside.
Already from the outset be felt tensions between the candidates.
Mitt Romney blamed in your opponent Rudy Giuliani that this would have become to New York in "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
This, for its part, responded with reproaches serious: "I would like to say that its own House was a" Port "for illegal." Giuliani replied to the Ex-governador of Massachustes by saying that he was who used to illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attacks: so far as the group of Republicans does not have a favorite clear, the eight presidential exploit the debate in the CNN, above all to discredit his adversaries.
Small videos of 30 seconds, road by Usarios Internet that were sent to Youtube, do not have much content.
"In this way of isolation leave Hitler coming to power," that was the criticism of John McCain to its adversary rum Paul, the only one of the meeting that insisted on immediately withdraw troops from Iraq.
Romney receives too much criticism by the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when refuses to recognise as torture the "waterboarding", a method of interrogation, to make a person drowning simulate his death.
The reactions of the public in the Chamber in St. In Florida show that in the meantime the most important issues of the campaign are other, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strong when praised values Conservativos and refused higher taxes.
So you can see better where the weaknesses of both favourite.
"At that time I got it wrong", explains Romney forgiveness and calls for people and the public television for having been defender of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf governs without uniform.
One day after its resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani President was done swearing as President.
As well end up the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took Juramiento for a second term of 5 years.
Television Pakistani transmitted in direct the ceremony in the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf respect the Constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday transferred its mandate to its army chief Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, particularly by the US.
Eight years after he seized power with a military coup bloodless, the ex-general rules for the first time the state as head civil.
With its renunciation of the post of head of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The another demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the public prosecutor of the state, after the Juramiento Musharraf is going to cancel very soon the state of emergency and meet the second condition of the West.
Since was declared a state of emergency in the Supreme Court there were many lawyers supporters of Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all the resources before the controversial new elections of 6 October the head of government.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a convoy of the military in the region Watiristán North, five soldiers were killed and another four were injured.
According to information from the spokesman of the army a bomb exploded in one of the streets in the border with Afghanistan.
Once again the founders of Krautrock.
The gang German more of the 1970's famous continues on its activity: three members of "Harmonia" took part in a concert in Berlin.
As Reestreno became a copy of "live 1974" that was written in the best time of the gang.
Already at that time were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to a meal official caused the feeling.
Each of them has in front of his yes Cajita, their cables and above all their buttons.
In the medium is sitting Moebius that has 63 years and is dress with a white shirt.
To the left is Michael Rother of 57 years, which has its portable computer and Guitarra.
On the right, looking for the audience, is Hans-joachim Rodelius, 73 years of age, which is very busy with the panel of controls.
Each contributing its sounds, among them are even pace.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This does not seem to upsets the gentlemen.
Something very exciting to the passionate of Krautrock was the fact that the gang Harmonia again make music.
What we need to reveal here is this: the questions precisely have shown that the name of the gang Retumbaba in the minds of the people, but it was not something special for 32 years after the public the Extrañase both.
But why the Germans can not also applaud your legend lives of the 1970s?
Especially as the ambiguity Kautrock was always more useful in England and the United States than in their own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a prize of music "echo the members of the" gang can 2003 Cologne for his work in the Chamber of life, we could see the faces of artists surprised of MAGP Germans.
And when network hot Chili peppers to band the Düsseldorf Neu!, all opened their mouths with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time in the scene for concerts of network hot Chili peppers as if it had been an old friend (of the gang).
Ignorance recognition at home and abroad, are only one thing.
It is a problem to remind this band, because the trio existed only two years and at that time I fail to a great effect on the public, however, was subsequently thanks to the other.
Already some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had done music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name,, promising much reputation.
At the beginning Tocaban in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
After, for economic reasons, they worked with a company of music in Duesseldorf that was Patronizada by a church.
For a while, Rother had a Trabajillo in Kraftwerk and then worked Guitarrista in the gang Neu! managed to improve the reputation of this band German at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf ruin, which is one of the 16th century, living as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological that in the Comune I, where Roedelius could complain of its position.
This was rather a life of artist full of surprises.
As they say, one day appeared a association of song Harmonia of Ottenstein in waste, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There was also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first Albúm is called "Musik von Harmonia" and "of the second lux".
Despite the fact that the music was calm and simple, the gang took financial problems.
Life as artist was not only to find itself.
The CDs "live 1974" was engraved during a concert in Griessem. Someone recalls that, in this recording participated almost 50 people.
Then Rother expressed a desire to push through Harmonia and do from time to time trials.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against the customs.
In 1975 band announced its separation.
Rother ended engaged in issues of Esoterismo and assured its existence with álbumes as "Flammende".
Revived the 1980s and from that time has had more success of which had Harmonia.
The recording in direct Albúm in Griessmer, that we must thank Groenemeyer.
Their company of music Grienland was objective is to cultivate this contribution own German to preserve it as music alive.
As the work of Roedelius, also band Neu! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmonia as band takes place in the House of the cultures of the world in Berlin.
The group was subsidised with public measures of the festival Wordtronics.
There is cope, English, the old punk and the author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also present Dr Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all the influence of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a Súper-banda, as he was in a vacuum.
The sentence of Brian Eno accompanied with music special fills the Chamber: "this music is the only certain music, it would Partenece the Fúturo".
There are photos which appears Harmonia with producers in a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is projections photos in black and white, where are instruments with cables.
In fact there are three veterans that began to improvise again.
Do nothing more than to set the microphones to the body and the battery to be able to produce some extraordinary tones with the help of the apparatus of effects that had built with their own hands.
Currently music electronic is as well as had to be.
Three people who expand in technology.
But that does not change anything.
Under the leadership of barbaric Morgenstern, against a background music is coughs, Susurra and at a good time of emphasis is sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock already was always a term of origin English.
But it was never rock.
Not sought the origin of gender in the blues, but in schools of music (can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing conventions artistic and social ().
Here who shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia retains the calm.
In the scenario is considering very well on what is already clear.
Where it begins and where has just music?
This can be broken one the nerves or give rapid moment of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "the hunting party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" engaged again to the war in the Balkans.
But both were not much conviction.
Or the concepts are set much in actions and Tirotes or the two films are Demasiando exciting.
Richard Gere with its "the hunting party" can not help in this case.
At the beginning there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the dark inside the country during the war in Bosnia, was found again the actor Richard Gere.
Finally we had lost sight man more of the 1980s, because nobody wanted to do so after their roles pleasant and minor in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "the hunting Party - when a hunter becomes what has" (why today the titles of films must be so long and?).
The film is a wonderful presentation to see: basically, reporter its role in the war is the presentation of what could do Richard Gere, if the fate and the film industry had not been so with him. He was a man whose better times of life, that as a monument of the ruin of its decline preserving so far the most of their charm.
"The hunting party", despite this triumph, together with "Moerderischer Frieden" that is production German and also be presented this week, turn out to be only a number of films without success on the war in the Balkans.
Can the film "Moerderischer Frieden" In short: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbia of Francotiradores of Kosovo, one of them is acting very quickly and that leads to Enamore of it.
The sense of the film is lost by the actions and the shootings, while we welcome the Serbs are not once again presented as the only guilty.
The film is as the number German "alarm takes on 11" without motorway, but in a position of war.
In the example of "the hunting party" can be investigated, because in reality it was never a good film on the war in the Balkans.
On another occasion, with another director and with other author of script (Richard Shepard in two positions), the history of reporters Americans in the war that is going to detect a Serbian war criminal called "Fox", probably could be a new "Now".
Thus, the stories are remarkably similar: small teams will be twice the mountains for something that can not do the army and is becoming a trip on madness.
One reason for the failure of "the hunting party" is at the beginning when we are presented with Simon, to whom he can not be simply a cynic with heart.
No, the script also provides an adventure loving with a Bosnia Muslim that will kill then.
Then "the hunting party" is far from the reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive quickly achieve what could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all hunting head of the world, which was caught the war criminal and leave them to the Bosnians Musulmanos to Vengaran of a fairly.
It is so badly, that tempted to appeal to the International Court in The Hague based on the Crimenes against Logica Cinematica.
However, the aim of the film is, in fact, one Profondamente human.
The Pelicula wants to condemn the fact that Karadi and Mladi Esten even free, and emphasises that the Americans and the French are not really concerned to pursue them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and bad are so similar, so that we have in mind a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this Peoma this is a mask of a devil Asia: "in the Gandes brow of its face see it, sharing the feelings with him, that hard is being bad".
In films as "the hunting party" there are also these demons but they show that it is hard to be good.
The problem is not only in the shadow of films of war in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper wrote that all films on Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
We can also add that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
Almost always applies a rule: when a star by a region of crisis or by the minefields, then there is something like "" with Patricia Arguette, "across all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "diamonds Sangrientes" with Leonardo Dicaprio.
Perhaps all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
Must go at least decades until Hollywood Ruede a good film on the Holocaust taking as an example the film "the list of".
Some films already need more time. The classic as works on the war in Vietnam "the deer hunter", "now" or "full metal Jackett" in his times were not concluded by unanimity as the masterpieces.
Perhaps today we know too much on world conflicts, and therefore in our time each massacre (Massenmord) has been tabled directly in two television at home.
And that is because the authors of script they have no objection (that is necessary in order to be able to) in good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "the great dictator" turned out in the end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know that such a bad was actually the Nazi regime.
Perhaps not should be a good person to rolling a film.
Perhaps we must be as novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with looking sarcastic and distant of an artist.
When asked to him on the parallels between its novel historic "dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, replied, "that is because only some things do not change never".
The big cities always will be in danger, men are always going to be killed cruelly and Yugoslavia always reign war.
Von Beust receives in response negative criticism on the Olympic Games.
The Mayor of Hamburg received a lot of criticism of the politics and economics not to apply for the Olympic Games in the summer.
Many want to continue to fight for competitions in section of water sports.
But Beust recalls that we have to be realistic to assess the possibilities.
Hans-joerg Schmidt-trenz, Director-General of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, said on Wednesday this resignation as "no good for the site economic".
In the last time any other project in the large city triggered much motivation of the organisation such as the idea of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective would not be able to maintain the political impetus, sport at the same level."
Schmidt-trenz called on the Senate not forget this project, but to find a new implementation in the long term "that relates to another time."
On Wednesday the mayor Ole von Beust kept his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organisation of the Olympic Games in the summer not be made at least until the year 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but that is decided by the Federation German Olympic sports," says von Beust in the online.
Referred to the decision of the Federation of sport (Sportbund) that is expected at the beginning of December, on the request of Munich for the Olympic Games in the winter of 2028.
"This preference means to us that during this period of time, we thought that until now have until 2028, from the point of view realistic will not have any opportunity".
Nevertheless, this dream not ended forever, said von Beust.
The Federation of sport in Hamburg (Hsb) regrets the statements by von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to ask the Olympic Games.
"It is too early to make it take the opportunity, if plans are ruined," he said on Wednesday Günter Ploß, the director of Hsb.
A renunciation of the request is contradictory to the statement made by the head of the Senate which it did in a reception at the general meeting of the Federation of German public sport of universities (Adh).
There von Beust appointed the application of Hamburg to Universiadas 2015 "not as a replacement" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of sport of universities appointed Hamburg as a candidate of the request.
The fraction of the Social Democrat Party (German Spd-bürgerschaftsfraktion) blamed in the Senate not to use the time so valuable to build houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delaying with the development of the small district of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or building houses," said Veit and Jan Quast, Members of the Social Democrat Party (German SPD).
While the SPD always called for an integrated planning of Olympia for small Grasbrook and then the use of houses built, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, the request from Hamburg to the Olympic Games in the summer of 2012 caused a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It is not the boxes of wood.
Anyone who concerns the terms Sweden and box of wood, believes in Ikea, but not think in Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the coffers of wood produced in Sweden are as the shadow on the list of works of Warhol.
Most of the 1990s and four Brillo-box'' of this list are false.
After a few months ago the newspaper Expressen "doubt about the authenticity of Brillo-boxes of 1968 of Warhol modern Museet Stockholm made disappointing: six" Brillo-boxes ", that the Ex-director museum Pontus Hulthén gave the museum modern Museet, are false, and almost 100 of the other type of" Stockholm, "which in the market, are too.
The prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between production and artistic Patrocionadas.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York its first "Brillo-boxes", painted the coffers of wood of red, blue and white, with the same shows that had cartons of soap powder "glare".
In accordance with Warhol, in the exposure of their works of 1968 in the museum modern Museet were exposed hundreds of Brillo-cajas cardboard. These did not Warhol (as a result of expenditure), but were brought directly from the factory cardboard of "glare".
It was not a question of works of art, but copies (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed produce in Sweden a Brillo-cajas wood, but it was not set out in the museum modern Museet.
Witnesses of those days speak now that almost fifteen boxes, who at the time came into the history of art and the auction as the original "Brillo-boxes" of "type Stockholm" authorised by Warhol.
In auctions some of them were bought by more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontus Hulthén did false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost 100 of boxes wood Warhol is the left him.
