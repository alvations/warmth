The European inflation slid in the food
The registered, rapid inflation in the zone of euro, is owed in the first place to the giddy growth of the price of the food products.
The increase of the prices in the month of November has been over it expected in the 13 countries of the zone of euro, registering - later 2,6 percent of the month of October - a 3.1 percent annual inflation - announced the Office of Statistics of the Union with headquarters in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts only gave as probable 3 percent - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), as opposed to the Canadian, British, and American issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, I am pretext that the decrease, along with the prices in increase of the commodities and the reduction of the enforced stoppage, they would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the rate of inflation by underneath, but at least around two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is found in the trap 22: "One must negotiate" on the inflation so that subsequently have not that to intervene in this theme.
The registered, 3,3 percent inflation in Germany, beat the record of twelve anuses; while in Espana enlarged from the 3.6 at 4.1 percent.
The inflation shot itself in the zone of euro in consequence of the galloping energy and alimentary prices.
The quotations to term of the wheat enlarged in 88 percent and likewise the quotation of the soy reached its maximum level since 1973.
In the same way, there was that to pay a lot more in the 2007 by the vegetable oil and by the dairy products.
The price of the crude oil in the world market enlarged this anus in 52 percent, reaching already last month the oil almost the 100 dollars the barrel.
According to the ECB, the inflation in 2008 will jump from the 2.1 current percent to 2.5 percent, on the other hand for the 2009 will diminish already to 1.9.
According to the analysts, the annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, nevertheless the annual average rate will be 2,1 percent.
At the same time, it is expected that during the anus 2008 the ECB reduce two times the interest rates.
Gallup foresees a governmental crisis
After a long stagnation, for principles from December the support of the Alliance of Democratic Youths enlarged significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced a so low level - 13 percent - in the case of the socialists.
The difference in the case of the sure voters of the parties - due to the greater firmness of the voters of the opposition - would signify a support of the more than two thirds (71 percent) set against the support of a fifth part for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of the Democrats Free they would not reach neither the necessary limit to have some escano parliamentary: its support inside the totality of the population is of two percent.
Among the sure voters there are one percent more than supporters in both edicts.
The economic environment continued being deteriorated even in comparison with the previous lower point - has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those that judged especially bad the economic situation of the country, while another 46 percent believes that the situation is enough evil.
The families, after the most encouraging expectations of the spring and of the summer, now they are more pessimistic as for the change of their own economic situation.
In which refers to the next anus, the majority of the population counts on the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth splits expects an improvement.
In the month of December, the 71 percent of them consulted, figure over any previous survey of the Gallup, reckoned that the President of Government more well desempena badly that well its functions.
The 13 percent of them consulted trusts or trusts a lot in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán counts on the 38 percent support of them consulted.
54 percent of the population does not trust in the absolute thing in the Leader of Government and 27 percent does not trust in the president of the Alliance of the Democratic Youths.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of the company thinks that is possible to control the experienced discontent set against the person of the Leader of Government without a change of government.
While after the disturbances of October of the passed anus 35 percent reckoned that would be desirable to maintain in the power to the Government and to the Leader of Government, at present this proportion is of only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believes that the only solution is the celebration of new elections.
The interest by the referendum is characterized by the circumstance of that the 60 percent of the polled to the question on the participation responded that would participate surely and another 20 percent said that is probable that participate.
To comparative way, in "some general elections to be celebrated this Sunday" would participate with security only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believes probable its participation. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt of the result of the referendum.
74 percent of the population would disapprove the payment of the rights of studies, 79 percent that of the medical inquiry service and 84 percent that of the hospitable attentions.
If we observe these proportions only among the sure participants in the referendum, the 81, the 84 and the 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of the rights of studies, the payment by the medical consultations and that of the hospitable attentions.
The most expensive one is the Auchan, the Tesco there is quintuplicado its prices
They maintained the increase average of the level of the prices of 16 percent the superstores of the commercial triangle of gold of Budaörs, with the difference that this anus has not enlarged the VAT.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
This anus also increased by average of 16 percent in the commercial triangle of gold of Budaörs the habitual basket of Christmas of the daily one Napi, but in all the superstores a growth was registered very over the thousand HUF.
As in December of the passed anus already they had itself "shot" the prices in the supermarkets of food, thus itself did not experience a percentage drastic increase in comparison with the high starting point.
Nevertheless, evidently it is terrifying for the consumers the fact that what the passed anus they bought from a price very under the nine thousand HUF, today for the present it they cannot do neither for ten thousand.
The basket of Napi in the superstores studied surpassed with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the basket of higher value was of 10 573 HUF.
(In the anus 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of the liquor Unicum and of the fish was maintained almost in the level of the previous anus, but a strong increase of the turkey breast fillet was registered, of the nut and of the seed of amapola.
The price of the wheat flour and of the bread continued the data of the headquarters of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have found also a kilogram of bread by the price of 139 HUF.
The competence did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
Likewise was surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with redeemable bottle of two liters cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
With all, in the basket of Napi Auchan was the most expensive one, while Cora the cheapest one.
According to our calculations, with regard to the prices of Christmas of the passed anus, Cora enlarged with a 15, while Tesco and Auchan with near 18 percent the prices that figure in the basket of Napi.
Comparing the values of the basket more face of the passed anus with that of the cheapest basket of this anus, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth among the cheapest one of the passed anus and the more face of this anus has been 21 percent.
The medium growth was of 1480 HUF.
The passed anus the medium growth of the prices was of 1206 HUF, so that during Christmas of the passed anus in the prices felt the increase of the VAT.
Exactly this process was the one that destroyed the commerce, the supermarkets visibly were incapable to make decision on the margin of prices to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of the change of the prices on the consumption.
(If the merchant plans badly the velocity of the circulation of a product, can lose an important benefit in the margin that is adjusted to the sales volume.)
The increase of the price of the basket of Napi reached such extremes in consequence of the increase of the VAT, that the most expensive one was a superior with 1720 HUF to the registered value in 2006, while in the cheapest one the difference was only of a 844 HUF.
This anus not such extremes were produced, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than the passed anus and the cheapest one also enlarged with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two seasons navidenas, a disastrous growth in the prices was registered in less than 20 months, in the superstores more 30 percent the price of the consumer goods of first need grew.
(Nevertheless this does not necessarily it confirm the figures of the headquarters of Statistics: this office, in the case of some food of first need registered in the interval of 12 months an increase of upper price at 30 percent.
Thus for example, besides the wheat, also in the case of the egg.)
According to the basket of Napi, in this last case this seems almost impossible, therefore in the price of this product that was quite expensive already the passed anus in comparison to the base, was registered, if worse comes to worst barely 10 percent of increase of prices.
According to all the indices, the suppliers of flour have a stronger position than those of egg, being able to impose the drastic increase of the prices even to the multinationals.
The superstores do not complain in the commercial triangle of gold, they speak constantly of positive results.
According to our experiences collected, to the majority of the consumers of the three stores visited, no longer the prices interest them.
Of all the products buy large quantities, being carried for palettes the food conserved.
In the manana on Wednesday, in the three stores large queues were formed by in front of the boxes because enlarged suddenly the number of the clients.
Nevertheless, we have information that in the interior of the country the sales volumes are lower, numerous multinational they complain to the institutes of survey because the incomes remain under its plans and not only in the case of the food, but also in that of the electrical appliances.
In many hospitals is saved with the disinfectants
This anus they have been registered in the various hospitals thousands of infections produced in the first place by the undue application of the antibiotics.
The circumstances of reigning hygiene in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds and the overload of the personnel do not favor the control of the infections - affirms the medical-jefa of department of the National Center of Epidemiology.
In many hospitals is saved even with the disinfectants.
Does not it do a lot of a contagion has been diagnosed with MRSA in the department of orthopedics of the Hospital János.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident the presence of the resistant bacteria to the antibiotics was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion was produced in this same hospital at the beginning of the anus.
To an injured one of a serious automobile accident they gave highly of the hospital and the same patient shortly after should return to the hospital in consequence of the contagion with MRSA and since then itself not an important surgery by the presence of the bacteria in its agency has been able to be carried out.
To December 10, this anus they have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by agents multiresistentes - said Karolina Böröcz, medical-jefa of department of the National Center of Epidemiology.
This signifies that in the hospitals for certain has been registered this agents produced by infections quantity multiresistentes, of the remainder does not have information.
Near the two thirds of the infections (683 cases) itself due to the MRSA, is to tell the Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to the meticilina-oxacilina.
A third of the human beings they carry in their nose the bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (LTD) without causing any illness.
The infections produced by the LTD (by ej. : inflammation of the throat, amigdalitis, cutaneous infections, infections of injuries) react well to the antibiotics and they are of easy processing.
Nevertheless, once it apply exaggerated or unduly to the antibiotics, the bacteria that normally react well to the antibiotics, they are transformed into very resistant bacteria to the antibiotics and they infect quickly in inadequate hospitable conditions.
They can cause serious hospitable infections, for example infections of injuries or septicemia in the first place to the patients with transitory or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the agency weakened, to elders or to people of little weight.
In opinion of the medical-director of the Hospital János there is nothing special in the infection of the MRSA, these infections are routine in the hospitals.
Itself not the infection with the epidemic should be confused, the MRSA only is absent - said Pot Nyulasi - where is not examined its presence.
Resistant to the antibiotics
"These patients are remote, the personnel of nursing attends them in rubber gloves and mask and the adequate antibiotics for their processing exist" - Pot said Nyulasi.
The patients hospitalized are examined previously to verify the presence of the MRSA in its agency, but not even thus the infection in all the can be avoided cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent the hospitable infections of the MRSA in most cases, nevertheless the current national hospitable circumstances do not favor for the prevention of the formation and the contagion with the pathogenic agents multiresistentes - affirms Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is produced fundamentally in hospitals and homes of elders, the hospitals should examine the patients hospitalized and to isolate immediately to them make ill that they carry in their agency the MRSA.
Nevertheless, in the Hungarian hospitals is not fashionable takes it of samples microbiológicas.
This fact itself due also to that the National Box of Health does not finance these medical exams.
So that most cases leave to the public light when are produced already the infections of the MRSA visible in the patient - the medical-jefa of department of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union does rigorous commissions for the application of the antibiotics in the human medicine and national guidelines exist also to treat the infections and pathological pictures.
It is necessary empenarse in which the therapy with antibiotic be directed, that is to say, should be done exams microbiológicos to impede that resistance set against the medicines be produced, but the hospitals do not always comply this demand.
It takes it of samples microbiológicas are still less frequent in the case of the walking patients or in the basic assistance - affirmed Karolina Böröcz.
It is saved with the disinfectants
The scientific experiments have shown that in most cases the MRSA is infected of a patient to another through the medical team.
Therefore, desempenan a very important role the wash of the hands, the use of rubber gloves and of masks, nevertheless also in this sense they experience you lack considerable in the hospitals.
The MRSA is infected by means of the broadcast by drops and the direct contact among people, nevertheless in the national hospitable circumstances always is not possible to isolate the patient infected.
It is more, the rooms of the hospitals frequently are packed, the beds many times are very you join, although to prevent the epidemic, the patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1,5 meters.
Sadly it can experience also - added Karolina Böröcz - that in the hospitals of economic situation less favorable is saved with the disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for the infection.
In opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where comply the adequate measures of prevention, less infections of this type are registered or can stop the contagion of the pathogenic agent.
It programs governmental against the MRSA
The processing of the contagion with MRSA is an enormous expense for the National Fund of Insurance of Illness, for which in all the countries fights itself against him.
In England for example a governmental program exists to prevent and to reduce the cases of the MRSA.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data supplied, the infections with MRSA show tendency of decrease in England.
The European Center for the Prevention and the Control of the Illnesses (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of the agents multiresistentes (among these the MRSA) and that of the hospitable infections that itself due to these pathogenic agents.
Negative the breathalyzer test of the commander of police that caused a fatal accident

Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
It is admirable the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention from across europe is directed toward that Balkan country before little mentioned.
What thing, where and who they buy in the still more cheap market of the EU, that will be recommended quickly?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The objective preferred for the acquisitions real estate agencies in Europe of the east is without any doubt Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments of the ski runs and the chalet of the beaches.
The regions montanosas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while in the beaches Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Costa del Sol", the old one Sozopol and Nesebar, but each time more real estate search people also in the outskirts of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central zone of the country - as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awake the interest of the property developers and each time more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap zone of Rus.
In the same way will be able to be attractive the capital one Sofía, the commercial spaces and of offices they promise a fast recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is in the best road to become one of the most attractive paradises of golf of Europe, being able to be thus a noticeable destiny also during the other two stations, besides the summer and of the winter.
Therefore, the investors precavidos already are making its purchases, for example in the outskirts of Bansko.
In opinion of the analysts, the ones that buy real estate in Bulgaria, they endeavor also to change their life and their way to live.
The majority of the clients are English, but they come also from France, Belgium, Espana and each time more than Rumania.
Likewise present the Cypriot and Maltese developers been and traditionally there are many Russian clients in the beaches of the Black Sea and in the paradises of skiing.
The foreign clients can be classified in three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
The ones that intend to be installed here buy new real estate or renewed by a price between 50 and 100 thousand euro or well old houses in badly state between 5 and 15 thousand euro, to renew them then.
They require good communication and access, besides for them has importance the proximity of a great city, the stores and generally of a local doctor.
They constitute the second category the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in the month of December was included among the first 10 vacation destinies of the Germans).
They constitute the third group the property investors that its purchases with the medium or long hope to benefit make time limit.
The price of the of the capital real estate goes in constant growth, since the demand is each greater time.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five anuses these they suffered a 21 percent annual increase
The increase of the price of the real estate surpasses considerably the growth of the salaries.
Fodor and the six for hundreds Hungarians
As it reported the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor the encounters to level of experts will be finished Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration they will continue the negotiations to level of ministers on the international climatic state after 2012.
The experts and politicians originating in 192 countries of the world deliberate on the waybill of Balí that arranges on the efforts after the emissions reduction period, established in the Protocol of Kyoto, in force until 2012.
Currently animated discussions on the individual among the developing countries are carry out and them industrialized.
United States already has indicated that for the moment does not desire to negotiate on figures to be exact, although tends to arrive at the agreement that in comparison with the situation of 1990, to the anus 2020 diminish with a 25 to 40 percent the emission of the responsible gases by the effect greenhouse.
Another great theme of the conference is that if the countries industrialized, besides reducing the emissions, they are or not arranged to offer helps material and technological to the countries that need it.
It arrived at an agreement besides on the aids to offer to the developing countries.
The fund of support, predicted in the Protocol of Kyoto, will be directed by a counsel of direction comprising 16 members, probably inside the Global Fund for the Environment of the UN (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit".
The six for hundreds of Hungary
In name of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the efforts of the EU to conserve its role of vanguard in the global protection of the climate and to promote the firm of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister declared that the EU compromises to reduce until 2020, with regard to the level of 1990 in 20 percent its emissions of gas, responsible by the effect greenhouse, independently of if will be signed or not the "agreement after 2012" and is willing to be compromised in diminishing even one 30 percent if the other large regions developed of the world and the countries in ways of They are willing to assume in agreement commitments with their responsibility and their capacities.
Gábor Fodor aimed that the countries signatories of the Protocol of Kyoto of 1997 compromised to diminish in 5.2 percent, inside this the then 15 member States of the EU compromised in complying 8 percent of decrease.
The commitment of Hungary is to diminish with 6 percent the emission of responsible gases by the effect greenhouse with regard to the period between 1985 and 87, that our country will comply - senala the press release of the Department of Environment.
It is a lot of what is in play in Balí, since inside two anuses there will be that to sign the international agreement of the long-term climatic politics, because if not, is insurance that its entrance in vigor would be postponed for after 2012. In this case the commitments of reduction, assumed in the Protocol of Kyoto they would not be you followed immediately by a new international system of reduction of emissions, whose need was notified in its more recent report by the IPCC, international scientific association of the UN that is occupied with the climatic change, that obtained the Nobel Prize of the Peace.
With it, the reduction of the emissions would suffer a delay and itself would not be able to impede an increase of more than 2o C of the average temperature of the Land, fact that according to the scientists would have measureless and irreversible consequences.
The I exercise British conscript in YouTube
The units of the I exercise British in a distributor of videos they publish recordings on actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize to itself.
First the British air force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of the services of YouTube: the units special displaced persons in Afghanistan since the March of 2006 are charging videos on their actions against the Talibans - reported the BBC.
These done recordings with mini mounted cameras on the helmets are controlled in the general body of operations of Kandahar, then they are sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
Is inevitable the political message
Already they are 139 the recordings originating in the soldiers of the air force that have been loaded in this way to the Internet and its "channel" has been seen already for more than 75 thousand people.
The Department of British Defense was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes so much videos of actions perpetrated in Iraq as in Afghanistan, in the meantime the Department of the Community of British Nations (Commonwealth Office) like the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channel YouTube.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force there was loaded the videos with objectives of recruitment, but in opinion of the Department of Defense they serve also to present him to the public the true objective of the presence of the I exercise British abroad.
This type of publicity practically does not cost anything in comparison with the conventional television commercials of recruitment - declared to the BBC the expert in defense Gordon Mackenzie - on the other hand, inevitably they have some political message, since in a specific form they justify the reason to be of the determined military actions by the government.
The Americans prepared a videogame
The I exercise worries also by the circumstance of that, besides the recordings fearfully published and censured, in the distributor enthusiastic videos appear also, for example on the death of the soldiers: in the movies of publicity "official", a little hypocrites, the officials speak at most of losses, without presenting nevertheless the bloody part of the battles.
Besides, of the fields of battle of Iraq and of Afghanistan they have loaded to the Internet already numerous engraved videos in real operations, but the I exercise British alone ultimately is taking advantage of this opportunity.
The Americans use a form a little different for the recruitment with the free downloadable videogames of shots called America' s Army, in which in the middle of a situation more or less real the player can be put directly instead of the soldiers.
Tómbola and salty tart at the party of Christmas of the departments

The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai on the other hand simply will offer with its colleagues in the classroom of the Department for the Local Governments and Territorial Development.

In consequence of the strike that Monday will be initiated, there will be that to include significant difficulties in the transportation: in the railroads itself to will stop working indefinitely, by the manana that stop a part of the public transportation of Budapest and more than the half of the intercity transportation of buses of the companías Volán.
Simultaneously, in numerous points of the country there will be closing of the half of the ways of the highways.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have adhered to the strike, its names are brought up to date constantly in the web page of the League.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, other for time definite.
To the afternoon on Thursday the State Railroad and the Free Union of the Railway Workers (SLTF) could not arrive at an agreement neither so even on the most minimum services, though, upon being approached the festivals of Christmas, each time are more the people that travel in the trains.
According to informations received up to now, since the start of the day to the 13 hours they will be in strike the workers of the Collective shipping Company of Budapest, those of Budapest Airport since the 7 to the 9 of the manana, they will celebrate a strike of four hours the Unions of LEAGUE of the Electric Industry and of Thermal Energy, the Unions of the Educators called to a strike of 2 and The Democratic Union of the Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will be pronounced in national strike in alternative schedules and the Democratic Union of the Workers of the Sector of the Health and Social (SDTSSS) that form part of the Forum of Union Cooperation, they will celebrate a strike of warning of two hours.
The most important one of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal relating to the reform of the public health and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demands is that they introduce gradually the new form of calculation of the pensions that the anus go into effect that comes.
The third one is that they assure, even before 2010, for the case of the advanced pensions the possibility that the occupations that deserve they can enter it to the system.
The fourth motive of the strike is that the Free Union of the Railway Workers (SLTF) that is part of the Unions of League, they do not accept the proposal of the Department of Economy and Transportation on the railway sidelines and they expect another different proposal.
Political Capital: In the country enlarges the risk by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risks Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of the Political Capital the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in the month of August of this anus with the support of the Movement by a Hungary Better, since various points of view has enlarged the political risk of Hungary and of the region.
In the "warning on risks" of the companía is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the major political risk constitutes it the fact that "with the worsening of the existing ethnic tensions between the population gypsy and not gypsy of Hungary, even short-term they will be able to be produced violent ethnic clashes".
The main motive of it is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard probably is the provocation of an event of this character - added the representative of the institute of investigations.
They affirmed that all it themselves due to one of the main lacks of the protagonists of the Hungarian political life: "The protagonists of the public life yielded the public debate of the problem gypsy to the representatives of the radical political groups and extremist, who they could support their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between gypsies and Hungarian".
This aggravates the problem, prevents the normal dialogue, fortifies the extremists and enlarges the probability of the crash of the violent conflicts - they reckon.
Moreover, according to the institute of investigations, the activity of the National Guard, by consequence of the great attention of the national and international average, "deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, above all in which refers to the stability and to the democratic development of the country".
They recall us that: from the otono of 2006 received each time greater publicity and impulse the re-organization of the radical groups and of far right of Hungary and that since the summer of 2007 they have been constituted in the country numerous organizations that themselves autodefinen of "associations of national self-defense".
"The common characteristic of these groups is that themselves autodefinen as civil organizations, while they proclaim openly the training of their members for the defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of the law and order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, of the I exercise, that is to say of the State" - they add.
They affirmed: all it is produced according to the method that tries to give him a civil presentation to different political aspirations, basing on the discontent of the company with the politics and with the political parties.
Therefore stand out the civil thing and the form of association in the case of these associations does not only serve to avoid the legal problems of the legal inscription, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor of risk also since the point of view of the relations of neighborhood.
"In recent months, in numerous neighboring States they referred to the Hungarian Guard as to a potential danger, while the figures political right-wing-nationalists of certain neighboring countries, they want to justify their own anti-Hungarian politics with the creation of the Hungarian Guard,.
All this influences on the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the institute of investigations, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a remote phenomenon in the Center and This of Europe, so that in all the region they enlarged the political risks.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard functions in similar form that for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in the month of August of 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of far right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard themselves due to the massive disturbances of the gypsies that were produced in one of the neighborhoods of Sofía (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization is "the national self-defense".
In its opinion, in the last 17 anuses there was "terror gypsy" in Bulgaria, nevertheless the State remained impotent and indifferent set against the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has caused an animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
Just as it was written, indicates the increase of the risk of the ethnic clashes the one that certain organizations gypsies of Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard up to now has shown resemblances with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, itself cannot be excluded that also the gypsies of Hungary react to the threat in similar form, organizing its own self-defense - can be read in the warning on the risks of the Political Capital.
The director of investigations of the Political Capital, Attila Juhász to the question of the agency of news affirmed: the analysis of risks is one of the activities of the institute of investigations.
As it said, each anus they publish its analysis of risks and when they experience something that can influence in the change of the risk, they inform the public opinion, as occurred in this case, publishing its warning on the risks.
The festival always is not written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines with precision the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and already has become a practice generalized that around the holidays - that the anus that comes they will be less - the working days they reorganize themselves.
Not even in the EU or in North America are unit the festivals.
The Hungarian laws do a difference among public holiday, festival of State and festive days.
The festive days fundamentally relate to religious festivals and historic events.
We celebrate the New Anus also: so much the last day of the old anus, as the first day of the new anus is festive - this last above all so that they can rest the ones that passed celebrating the old anus.
During all the anus we have eleven festivals written with red numbers in the calendar.
Is public holiday March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23, commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
August 20 we celebrate the foundation of the State, the 1o from May the labor day, the 1o and 2o of November we recall to ours family and friends dead.
Besides, in our country are festivals from two days the EASTER, the Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious few festivals times coincide with a weekend, therefore often bridge is done when before or after the festival there is labor a single day.
In exchange for weekends extended thus, during Saturdays prior cannot stay away of the work or of the school.
It is the minister of work that to regulate in its specific decree when one must work exactly in exchange for the directly preceding day or after the festival.
This legal norm is of obligatory compliance for all the owners and for its employees, as well as for the employees and public officials.
Is not obligatory on the other hand for the businesses and institutions of services that, due to their function, they work uninterruptedly even during the festive days.
This anus the order of work will be able to be altered only around the festivals of the end of anus: from December 24 practically stops the life in the country, since according to the experiences, the majority of the people "does bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the anus or they take their holidays during these days.
The several next anus of our festivals they will coincide with the middle or with end of week, for which there will be less changes in the working days that this anus.
First the agenda around the labor day will be modified so that then, during four successive days, they can rest the workers.
On Saturday, 26 of April will be working day, so that to change Friday 2 of May be festive day.
The other change relates to the festival of October 23: on Saturday 18 of October, there will be that to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the anus that comes during the anus end festival will be able to rest, since from December 24 itself will not work in almost none splits, neither although the last day of the anus be a Wednesday.

You lose interest if want to comply with the expectations of the public
The car advances slowly in the habitual jam of the manana.
It sounds a compass extrano in the radio: electronic effective violin.
I rise the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones is added the low one and then the voice of a female chorus as a true jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 reproduces the song Wings of Love of Zagar.
The national musical life did not spoil us a lot with electronic pop music of quality.
But now completely different this jam seems when you are listening the new disk of Zagar.
Appears Yonderboi. Some new and interesting songs of the underground digital national little by little go changing the image and although again be fashionable the rock style garage, breaks guitars, the electro pop national has shown: there are news under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer initiated their career in the city of Pécs, touched in the assembly of Yonderboi until initiated their independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of a same assembly.
With their project (Zagar) and their music, a mixture of jazz, of electronic music dance number and pop, tried to succeed, when they asked him soundtracks film (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The most extensive public knew the assembly that at first acted alone in clubs sin us when the magazine wan2 selected its first disk published in 2002 among the fifty most important national disks, classifying to Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the ONLY formador national of tendencies, capable of being sold also in the western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and their assembly they are fashionable, but nobody has asked them if they carry or not gladly this label.
The assembly reacted like should react: prepared a still better and new disk.
The disk recently launched, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead will be able to open new roads for them, although the own title intends to establish the continuity with the initial anuses in the city of Pécs.
Therefore this title was one of the lines of the old assembly of Balázs Zságer.
It is well the reference on the graceful thing, on the flight, but besides the graceful thing of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and the tendency of the epoch - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of the rock one and roll.
With these songs presented the disk in the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer that at present works in England with the joint one The Puzzle.
In the disk a true success of the channel is included mr2 Petõfi that ultimately transmits of the manana at night popular music. This radio station carried to the ears of the listeners the music of highly flight of Wings of Love, engraving with six Hungarian singers ($vats Underground").
Therefore all is in order (?).
Hvg.hu asked to Balázs Zságer.
Hvg hu: After this new success the question arises: The one that you are interpreting, in what measure is a music dedicated to a select public?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select public for me signifies little.
In my opinion two types of castes in the light music exist; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the thus called music subterranean alternative can be bored, meaningless and can be composed likewise alone for the sale, what does it commercial.
But likewise a good pop song can arise of a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners functions with this spirit, independently of languages and national borders.
Hvg hu: You see some difference among the reception of your music on the part of the foreign and Hungarian public?
B. Zs: Abroad, above all to the West of us, the light music has larger traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty anuses frecuentan the concerts, but also the oldest.
They lend a lot more attention to the changes that are produced in their around in the light music, because they consider it part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg hu: What function has the public in your work?
It imports you who are, from where they are and how many are the people that listen your music?
B Zs: Naturally I feel well upon seeing that each time you grasped more people to our concerts.
But never there we are composed music for the market.
We do not compose music by some objective, but by some motive.
The role of the public more well feels in the concerts where exists a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And nevertheless, I realized that if you want to comply with the expectations of the public, lose its interest.
Hvg hu: Up to what point you intend to continue the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and did its career more well to the West of us.
B Zs: We do not continue their road, in spite of the fact that at times they try to compare our music with his.
We more well work in team, we trust in the musical presence of the other and we leave that unfold.
At first was inevitable that compare our works with the music of Yonderboi, since many of us we initiate our career in their group and from there we undertook another road.
Hvg hu: In the list of successes of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people the name listened for the first time of Zagar in relation to this song.
You opened concientemente with this style toward a more extensive layer?
Zs B. : We did not intend to compose large successes and to sell with these successes our disk.
This song is something more than that.
We add it in the end of the disk, trying to relax after the sonorous orgy of the disk and of the heaviest themes.
Hvg hu: How have you selected the six singers?
Why exactly to them - which was the main motive?
B Zs: The idea was to create a chorus to the style gospel music.
Then it came the idea to create this chorus of the soloists of good voice of national musical our own setting.
Thus that chorus of six women was created - that is to say Seine, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neon] and Juci Németh - that then was baptized as the Divas of Underground.
Hvg hu: You composed exactly thus the song or the girls changed some things?
Zs B. : This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had already all the material of the disk, we think that still lacks something.
The harmonious one attracted the song.
Still that night I recorded the song that later the girls they learned it.
All arrived practically to the first intent and in incredibly spontaneous form.
I remember me, enthused me a lot then, but naturally needed also the Divas.
With my voice not to have functioned with so much force.
Hvg hu: So much in the concert as in the disk seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are not soloists (except the brief alone one of Judy Jay), they do not have own role, they sing all meetings and not more hardly than the music, for which the music not only acompana their songs.
Also in the setting they are located in the fund.
Deliberately?
B Zs: They are in the fund simply by technical problems.
On the other hand consciously we did not want to distribute roles of soloists.
The song also turns on it, on that we forget a while of ours ego, the one that who from where has come and where goes, we leave therefore that those wings, the wings of the love raise us.
They to have wanted to achieve that also other to feel that been of ecstatic spirit that we feel we when was born this song.
Hvg hu: To which did you dedicate more I work?
Zs B. : In the musical composition in reality to none, more well at the moment of to mix there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray' s Dilemma in which I am touching in a piano of concert or the Rock' n' Roll Goes To The Girls, where during long while not the groove wanted to function and then, little by little all was put to its place as in a puzzle.
Hvg hu: Which it is your song preferred in the new disk?
Zs B. : This changes constantly with the concerts and because already I have "freed" the disk.
Now the Prophet Is TO Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Be me.
A treacherous stockbroker risks thousands of millions by his inferiority complex
A disloyal embezzler.
Thus it is like indicates its old employee, Jerome Kerviel, the gigantic French banker of Société Générale, owner also of the Bank of Czech Commerce.
By him lost near five billion euro.
Nevertheless, it seems rather than Kerviel was a great player that wanted to be compared its colleagues and, without doubt, with good capacities.
Sensed time ago, as opposed to all the large Czech banks, the crisis in the market of American mortgages.
"It has a fragile character" was left oir of its superiors, the same that sent the police.
But what is removed of the answers of Kerviel according to what reveal the French mass media, like the newspaper Him Monde, is that was a matter of a man that to ends of last year had a profit of more than 1,600 million euro thanks to its business.
Crisis not only in America
"Everything that I wanted to cause was to win money for my bank" assures in its answers.
Exactly, in summer, managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euro.
This opportunity already saw it to come at the beginning of year.
In February they began to listen some news on the calls mortgages sub-predominate offered clients of low incomes or to those that in the past had problems with the payments and that those clients would begin to have problems.
Nevertheless, this crisis should not influence in all the economy.
Kerviel it was not believed and wagered correctly.
And later, to end of the year their profits surpassed the 1,600 million euro.
"When already I won my first 500 million did not I know as to notify it" confesses Kerviel and adds, that not nothing for he himself has left itself, at all.
During all the interrogation declared that had falsified the registrations in such a way that itself did not arrive at its discovery.
Even it came deceive the leaders, even when the Market Eurex began to be interested for its business.
The risk became benefit
It was afraid that came to discover?
More well, not.
"I thought that had earned 1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would be happy them."
From where did it remove so much force of will to be risked that way?
In my position should work itself gradually.
It entered to work in Société Générale in the year 2000, exactly after finishing of studying in Lyon.
Its annual salary was handled among the 51,000 dolares.
Two years later already was an assistant of stockbroker and in the year 2005 he became stockbroker with an annual salary of 90,000 dolares.
Even so knew that never was going to win so much as the others.
"In my first interview in the year 2005 already I observed that they looked at me with caution.
Due to my formation and also to my personal and professional progress" described Kerviel to the investigators.
But to the little time of my entrance in the business the first one arrived great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the attacks with bombs in London, playing downward a title of 500 million euro.
And this supposed a mechanism of starter, and wanted more.
If it is that you win, we leave you
"This is like a ball of snow" said the police.
But it is said that the leaders knew about all this or that more well they suspected it.
"While it won money, they closed the eyes."
Only that, later, the blow arrived at the beginning of this year.
In an I gave lost billion euro.
After the weekend to half of January wanted to erase every track.
When Monday arrived at work, no longer worked in the bank.
And two you gave later, the bank announced that had lost 5,000 million euro by its fault.
And how did they manage to locate him?
It passed to be a suspect from its holidays.
"I elected only four you gave by the year elapsed.
The runner that does not have holidays is a runner that does not want that nobody glance at his expedient" he finished Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to obtain 365 billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programs of the ones that the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euro (approximately 365 billion crowns).
It treats practicamente of the half of the grand total that the Czech Republic can obtain of Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of seven operational programs some 125 billion crowns for the regions will leave approximately.
The Czech businesses will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns of the Program Business and Innovation.
Most of the money will go destined to the transportation, to 150 billion.
The Program of Transportation is the major of the operational programs and represents until 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain of the fund.
This money enlarges the budget of the state fund for infrastructures of the transportation that the next year will include the quantity of 90,800 million crowns.
The program of Business and Innovation should serve the businessmen and businesses for the obtaining of resources in the innovation of the business.
The businesses should obtain financing for the acquisition of new technologies, for the industrial investigation and for the implementation of organizing methods more troops.
In which refers to the current use of the funds of the EU, the Czech Republic is found among the countries recien entered that except them they use.
It suffers of twenty years for the former president of Nicaragua, decreed the court
The Court of Appeals of Nicaragua decreed Thursday the grief of 20 years for the former president of the pies, Arnaldo German, which was condemned in the year 2003 by the embezzlement of 100 thousand million dollars (almost 1,800 million crowns).
In spite of it, a time despues, was freed of the jail to pass to house arrest in its estate not far from the metrópili Nicaraguan.
Is not anything clear in these moments, according to the agency AP that, the then leader of the central american state between 1197 and 2002, be again among grilles.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, will depend more well of the prison agents if they leave German to finish their punishment at home or if they cause they return it to the prison.
Four years ago, the court showed as the German transferred constantly money of the government to the account of a business in Pánama.
This company was fictitious and the account belonged, in reality, to its relatives and followers more cercanosT.
It splits of this money finished in the fund that German created to finance its campaign in the elections of the year 2001.
Thus they approved us the budget
Thus is.
The Budget of State was approved.
Why is special this budget?
It is the first one elaborated by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget of this year already was approved with the support of because prepared it the minister Sobotka and itself could not be permitted the not to accept it.
Aside from different debates before the voting on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, did not happen anything dramatic.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view although the most influential one, approved with tranquility the new law.
Is a great paradox.
Each government begins and finishes with each chapter and departure of the budget, he like or not.
The budget is an important part of the politics but in it hides the rivalry to be able between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media of comunicacón and because of it they dedicate him a special attention.
The political discussions are a lot more interesting than the simple numbers.
The Budgets of the State of the last governments of the social democrats suffered from three defects that for this year of 2008 is not possible to solve so easily:
The first one of them is the high participation of the obligatory laws, call as of expenses of the proxies that are not only the pensions but also the social security benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of and.
The second of them is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of the public financing, as the municipal budgetary deficit and common.
In spite of it, the major risk is not found in the deficit of the Budget of the State.
This is public and relatively low control.
The time bomb, nevertheless, is found in the deficit of the common and municipal budget.
Many mayors to be able to obtain other sources of investment, aside from the money of the taxes, rates and credits of the banks, often they emitted, meaningless, obligations with which got into debt disproportionate to their City Hall.
In recent years these debts through the massive sale of energy actions and of other networks of development managed to pay that received of the state and of the privatization.
At present they do not include this resource.
If we adhere only to the verified and official facts, we discover that:
Our economy, already some years ago, passes for phases of growth of the same form as the remainder of the world, of what boasts.
This it was the ideal occasion so that its government put order to the finances of the State.
Nevertheless, instead of it the state continued being gotten into debt.
The remainder of countries, excepting some as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, they saved a lot more reasonably than our republic.
Is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that inside the global measures we are less threatened by the poverty.
Therefore are not necessary the social massive programs that, unfortunately, in recent years inutilmente swelled with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate part of the incomprehensible expenses populistas approved this year before the elections, if in brief does not change the retirement age and the reform of the pensions then will be the end really of any politics in this pies and, govern who govern only will be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians that govern will be transformed into officials, mechanical distributors of most of the money of the taxes for the retirement and the social security benefits.
Therefore, the budget of this year cannot be a revolutionary, but he can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the expenses of the proxies.
The deficit planned of more than 70 billion for the year 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the passed government not to have squandered in the last ten years what were able.
Not quisieramos that the politicians that govern be converted only in officials because of it we should be patients and to grant to this weak coalition of the government, that realizes that the state only can spend what is capable of obtaining of the taxes and the rates, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a stable Budget of the State.

The Banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Swiss, British Central Banks and Canadian decided to fight together against the crisis of the Market of finances.
In the it Marked monetary will be received more than a hundred thousand million dollars through tenders.
In these tenders the banks auction the interest rates by which they are capable of lending money.
For example, the American Fed will send to put out to bid forty thousand million dollars, and later other twenty-four billion the central banks of Europe they will facilitate them and Swiss.
After the attacks of September 11, is the first time that central banks of different states come to an agreement in this process coordinated to protect and to diminish the consequences of the crisis of finances.
"This step should solve the major economic problem, that is to say, the contínuo growth of the shortage of free capital that the banks would be able to lend" wrote in its report for the clients, Bernard Baumohl of the consulting business Economic Outlook Group.
"This action coordinated of the central banks probably diminished the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent" added Baumohl in its report.
The banks already have spent sixty thousand million dollars in outstanding credits, above all in the United States.
The economists expect still thousands of millions in losses.
"The central banks should have really fear to what expects him still when they decided to give this step" said the main economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems to be that the situation is really badly" added.
The central banks are afraid that have the same problems of access to the loans and that because of it they will have to lend more expensive to their clients.
This would reduce the consumption and would send to the American economy to the recession with different impacts in the growth of the economóa world.
The central banks thus decided, after not to manage to reduce the call rate LIBOR, interbank rate Londoner that is utilized for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This signifies that the banks feared constantly to be lent money even when the Central Banks of US, Canada and Great Britain reduced during the autumn their interest rates several times.
"Will have the same effect as another fall of the interest rates" told the agency Reuters, Greg Salvaggio of the business Tempus Consulting.
Some economists do not miss that the step given by the central banks contribute to light the crisis because does not solve the fundamental problem that is it fallen of the real estate market in US.
Klaus: The debates of the ecologists are incredible
The climatic global change affects above all to the developing countries.
The president Václav Klaus was expressed again with regard to the problems of the global warming-up.
The criticism arose now with the closure of the international conference of the UN on the climatic change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where presented their book Azúl, not green planet, commented that the debates of the ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange government representatives mixture and of non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference among the rhetoric that is used and the reality.
"There the debates barely are structured, are fireworks of words, replacements of the solution to the current problems" said Klaus.
The Czech president during the presentation of its book underlined that this theme is for him very important and that therefore is interested.
It expressed also its happiness by discovering his book translated to the German because as said "many times only I find me with the caricature of my ideas".
Now them they interested they can be reported on their mixed opinions.
Klaus recalled that is not a climatologist but that has, according to his opinion, sufficient supposed as to write a book as this.
It is an educator, with capacity to continue and to judge a dissertation specialized, has experiences with statistics and is also economist.
At the moment main of the closure expressed their thought that the climate changes constantly and that its changes are normal, that on the warming-up of the planet not an agreement among the scientists exists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, neither they represent possible disasters and that the intents by influencing in the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and expensively unacceptable.
Besides as experienced man with the totalitarianisms considers like unacceptable to impose the opinions done not test to other, what feels as a dangerous form to limit the liberty of the others.
To the questions of the presents explained repeatedly that is not in against "of the reasonable defenders of the environment but against the militant ecologists that do not they take in consideration the relation among prices and benefits".
Of the same theme spoke Klaus in Vienna already two months ago in the Institute Hayek.

For each one of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and by the children, a million.
The hospital offers at most 200,000 by each father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Dostál is not in principle according to the proposal of Veleba.
"Such demand do not we approve it, is too high" said Dostál after the meeting of today.

Polívka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the suit on the mark Kingdom of Valaquia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first one that utilized the mark Kingdom of Valaquia but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka was not presented today in sight oral.
According to his lawyer the cause probably have not finished and its client will resort.
"The suit consists of that the Mister Harabiš and its team are some parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka" said after the process, the lawyer of Polívka.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Valaquia, to everyone comes him the image of the actor and funny.
The same idea has also Harabiš.
"We carry after us some ten years of work.
Search of money and invention of activities" said.
For him, the cause of the suit is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that because of it would also be able to receive something.
They want to live like parasites of our work" added.
A lucrative business
According to the court the mark Kingdom of Valaquia was utilized first by Polívka in its program of television.
In the year 1993 was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then did not it be a matter of orienting it toward the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
Some years later to Harabiš occurred him itself to publish the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that funny origin a business resulted and a lucrative business activity of which Harabiš created later the company Kingdom of Valaquia.
In the year 1997, Polívka agreed the use of its name and firm in the passports and even offered its possessors discounts to the vistantes of its farm and assistants to its spectacles.
Who will sit down in the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only utilized a simple idea that Polívka make public in the setting for its own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia" said the judge.
It added nevertheless that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and their team which they were dedicated to it completely.
The contribution, among the today decomposed parts, continued to the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
Since that moment they began to be given conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination arrived with the overthrow of the "king Boleslav I, the elected by always".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš derived in the singer Jarmila Šuláková, like the queen mother.
In the year 2002, Polívka presented an accusation against Harabiš and its company that until today has been rejected for the court.
Something in clearly it would be able to bring in the lawsuit, the tournament by the throne with its princesses, that already is preparing Harabiš.
Of him the new king should leave.
It has not wanted to be watchful still more data neither dates.
"Do not we have any hurry.
Would have that to be something as the road of the king toward Moravia.
The king would have that to be elected in a concrete date.
Even the Mister Polívka can be presented" added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1,6 VTi: prejudices surpassed
To tell the truth never i have liked too much the Peugeotu 206.
Its characteristics of march never special nothings, the quality of the box of changes, maneuver and also the product would be able to characterize as under the average.
But now exists in the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this, is a lot better.
This Minibus called SW is a little more advanced and to me, already only remains me to think it to me better.
When I tested the classical one Peugeot 207 five doors, complained me, for example, of the space of the head in the rear seat.
But this it would be the only complaint because the bodywork of the Minibus signifies in this sense, that I am not going to suffer before the two meters long.
Flying for the world
Step by the interior one rapidamente for repeat it not too much.
Is a matter of an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here would value more the invention of design although already the car seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there they remain the times in which we complained of short seats and endorsements.
Also as opposed to the model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here can feel how the measures of the bodywork have grown.
In the Minibus disappears it cited shortage of space in the head.
Suitcases to the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This I should value it as very accessible (thanks to the portón rear fold-up) and a storage well distributed.
The dead spaces are equipped with straps of rubber that suppose an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and they can extend to the extent of holding heavy objects.
But quedémonos in the deposit.
According to the boards, in basic state has a capacity of 428 liters what in comparison with the competence is more well a medium value.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same more sold type in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Minibus.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the model of Mladá Boleslav, we ascertain that the Peugeot remains to the rear with its perceptible 52 liters.
Of holidays to the foreigner or upon placing the stroller of the boy his value is a critic.
But if it had that to comment somewhat positive then I should cite the flat that remains enough plan after breaking down the endorsements of the second one linea.
120 horses in four marches
Ours tested automovil was equipped with an encedido of injection of four valves on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth thus is like should seem a 1600 that underestimated the relative five doors.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, has impulse.
If I compare it with the epoch of the škoda of then that seemed as if the exhaust pipe was blocked by a cloth, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for all the pockets.
We owe, nevertheless, to keep in mind that we have tested a vehicle elegantly equipped and with a very good motor.
The basic price of the car with lit of injection of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, still is able.
Ours you aggregated they put it since 410,900 crowns, what already is too much.
The type Premium tested already reaches other 80,000 crowns.
Only that tendriamos still airbag in the heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper, rear windows automated...
That is to say, the car with all of all, slope 531,900 crowns.
Is a lot, but include the complements of the team in the Fabia and will arrive at an enough number seemed.
Now already only it remains to be decided for which of the two marks.
The Slovak students are not integrated in the English schools
In the English schools they attend the east countries children of Europe and because of it, the locals fear more changes in the schools.
The integration of the Europeans of the east for now only brings a series of problems.
Even the British schools register those cases where the conflicts between the emigrants and the children of the natives enlarge in violence.
The problem of the integration of the children of Europe of the east in the British schools remains very well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where they begin to grow the conflicts between the natives and the Slovak emigrants.
Discussions, estorsión and rows among students already have reached even the own parents.
The situation has arrived so far away that the police of Chatmam arrested a Slovak woman that was hitting sticks to a student of ten years with a green stick.
In her defense said that the girl was insulting her son with insults of racist tone.
The police had to act also after an attack of two girls under age against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls entertained him with racist insults and stones threw him.
"When we went home, a boy approached toward us to the stop of the bus and he began to spit us.
When I told him that left it did us the gesture to launch us apples and pears, and later descended the pants and its rear one showed us" described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are of both parts.
One of the natives even appointed to the conflict with the emigrants of the east of Europe as of fight by the survival.
The cases already mentioned previously, they show us as the environment in the English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Great Britain to have recorded 70,000 Slovaks that came here by labor motives.
Approximately some 30,000 Slovak students attend the English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For the vistantes is really the island of the liberty.
Any thing that expect of its holidays can come comply, provided that choosing correctly.
Large, golden and sandy beaches waves or a tranquil sea as a reservoir.
The palm tree and the all inclusive with waiters offering pizzas in the beach, ice creams or various cocteles.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the island of the Caribbean sea can find all this and a lot more.
Only in an island finds still a lot more and that island is Cuba, the biggest and the most beautiful one of all the islands of the Large Antilles.
In the epoch of the Spaniards, Cuba came be the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place than human eye have seen.
Havana became store and port of load of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted of America and they carried to Europe.
And later the American epoch arrived.
The National Hotel grew to ends of the years 20.
It sent it to build one of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that there was of criminality in US (and therefore, prohibited) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, play and prostitution.
Among their guests they were found, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings arose, by wide avenues they ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in the years 50 of last century.
Ernest Hemingway an estate in San was bought Francisco of Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had its yacht.
In the walls of the Bodeguita of the Middle they left their firms the stars of the show business and politicians of every America.
And today?
In the walls of the Bodeguita habanense you can leave also its autograph.
In the bar of the expensive National Hotel the coctel according to their desires they mix him.
And those cars already of worship of the years 50, until today they continue functioning for Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived already time ago they have oxidized between these humid and salty winds.
Still when Havana, especially the old neighborhood goes deteriorating notably, does not exist in the outskirts so many marvelous colonial monuments as there.
Other places are changed in beauty, for example, Trinity.
Due to that the tourism brings so much necessary money, its development this guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels grew not only in Havana but also in dry Dock, in the coast of the province of Holguín and in small islands as Key Coconut, Key Guillermo and other.
Cuba offers still a curiosity that is in the unique world and that very is valued for the lovers of the railroad.
The cane of sugar is transported since the immense plantations to the factories of sugar by vias narrow in steam engines or electric.
Its garages by scores of years themselves were not discovered and now they are there, machines that function and whose model brothers that there are in other parts of the world only are found in the museums.
Where go?
The best-known place for the majority of the vistantes does not change.
And because of it, it is not necessary to speak more than Havana or dry Dock.
Perhaps, only to recall that in the already cited estate of Hemingway there is a museum that for those that be lovers of the writer, not to should stop visiting it.
The valley of Vineyards is the most picturesque corner from Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in limestone rock lands.
Heaps, limestone rock pillars and rocks of high steep in them fallen of the valley, and in their caverns fertile lands are acclimated thanks to which rocky places are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where is cultivated, probably, the tobacco of greater quality in Cuba.
Visiting some of the Havanan factories of pure can be found with its final product.
Perhaps to someone seem him interesting that there rolled itself the Chilean part of the series, the major Zeman.
Trinity
City of old abolengo that was founded not a lot after the Spaniards colonized the island.
The slavery and the sugar brought it fame and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French colonists arrived later, in four centuries barely has changed.
Trinity, between the sea and the saw of Escambray, is a so separated place that still in the years 50 of last century not highway existed that it to unite with the remainder of the pies.
Such isolation helped it to remain out of the remainder.
New nothing was built and because of it, neither, nothing was destroyed, therefore each person was happy to have where to live.
If it has more time to be in Trinity that a single afternoon, is worthwhile to know interesting places in the nearby outskirts as the Beach of Ancón or the valley of the factories of sugar.
The night belongs to the House of the Music, which encourages with its music the silence of the tomorrows.
Baracoa
Small city in the western extreme of Cuba, some they consider it as the most beautiful one of the island.
With security that opinion already is confirmed by the own road.
The two highways that arrive there from Guantánamo should pass for high and broken mountains, thus how by a nature that barely knows the action of the man.
This oriental place of Cuba has been recorded as world heritage by the UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they do the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in reality is a matter of a cross that arrived 100 years later of the disembarkation) and since the hill, where the castle was found and that now there is a hotel with their same name, the mountains can be seen and among them the best-known one, the Anvil.
Coffee, ron, pure, the Saw Teacher, the Bay of the Pigs and the island of Pines, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patroness of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of the Copper, the Witchcraft, African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, of all it they would be able to fill many pages.
Nevertheless, as it is said, better to see it some time.
The allies are passive in Afghanistan, the Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment is what is influencing in the march of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO, according to the minister of American defense, Robert gates, should design a concrete plan for the next years.

The following one is to enable to the population that alone can begin the economic development and of security" the issuing one told BBC the minister of defense, Give Browne.
The ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to data of the American army is greater that in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew in comparison with the last year in 27 percent, and in the province Helmand until 60 percent.
The pàises of the NATO have in Afghanistan around 40,000 soldiers of the ones that one fourth they are in the south of the territory.
Nevertheless, for the United States, the allies have arrived at the same limit as for organization and equipment of the units.
Exactly they ask more helicopters, soldiers and expert pra to coach the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously in concrete goals for the future and the way in which we will reach them" said Gates.
In a sense seemed also spoke today the Secretary general of the NATO, Jaap of Hoop.
"Does not it be happy me to know that is what we have in the land and the sky in Afghanistan.
We consider a ninety hundred of soldiers and teams that would need, and that is little" said Of Hoop to the agency Reuters in the closure of the encounter of three you gave with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the assistant countries in recent months the polemics reigns of if all the allies do the maximum in Afghanistan.
By passive it was criticized, for example, Germany.
"The Germans have in Afghanistan a relative number of replacements.
But they are found in a zone of minimum violence and the demands of fight there are not as high as in ours, in the south part and this of the pies" said Gates.
The sensationalistic newspaper Sun, this week called vague to the German soldiers.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to play while our boys fight" wrote Sun in a material accompanied with photographs of German soldiers playing tennis of table.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photography where the British troop played a party of rugby in the south part of Afghanistan.

It compared today in front of a court to Jartúm for to have given a name to a teddy bear
The teacher British court in Sudan for insult to the Islam has been condemned Thursday afternoon by a court of Jartúm to 15 days of prison and to the expulsion, indicated its lawyer.
The British one was accused of to have left students from 6 to 7 years to give the name of Mahomet to a teddy bear when every representation of the prophet of the Islam is illicit.
Was long-suffering of a grief of lashes.
This teacher of British school of age of 54 years in function to the Unity High School of Jartúm in Sudan, has been person under arrest Sunday in its house and accused of attack to the Islam and of sedition, by virtue of the article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, consequently of several students parents complaints before the Sudanese Department of the education.
The history goes back in fact monthly of September, when this teacher asks her students, of 6/7 years of age, to elect a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names leave the mouth of the children, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", account the director of the school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 children of each 23 there are elegigo to Mohamed as name preferred.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Moslem prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have carried out a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear he - same did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the respected prophet as an insult to the Islam.
One of the Moslem colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, professor in the same school in Sudan, needed that knew it well and that would never have done something that can be insulting toward a religious faith, "I feel it only that have asked the children to vote for a name", treats according to him only of an "innocent error".
Opinion divided by numerous students of the teacher of school that describe it as "very attentive toward its students" and "that never speaks of religion in class"..
We recall that the name Mohamed is also the most given middle name in Great Britain, is written in English with 14 different ways.
This name often elegigo by the Moslem families is a way to honor to the prophet (often given the first boy of a family).
But which they are the rules that concern to the utilization of this name?
For example to give it to a toy?
Treats of course of a question of interpretation.
They have not arrived Wednesday to an agreement on the future statute of the province, during the last session of negotiations to Vienna.
In the end, the failure.

The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, of the state university of San Petersburgo, goes back further: the civil company delayed in this country Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of the individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the years 90, "Poutine re-established the model of a paternalistic State, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by the terrorism, but by a certain economic relief", esteem María Lipman, of the Foundation Carnegie.
Today the Russians "renounce for own will to the personal responsibility" of who briefly they had given test after the crash of the USSR.
"¿ Why to reflect? "
The phenomenon touches all the social layers, included the world of the matters.
And the administrative elite thinks to preserve the statu quo: 65 governors (of each 85 leaders of Russian regions) direct the local lists of the Russia united..
The new liberties imported of the West are often synonyms of chaos, as in the years 90.
The opinion prefers the stability.
In name that the Russians will not vote neither by the extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, professor of age of 54 years: "¿ Why to reflect?
The ones that are to the power are not too much evils, why to change them? "

Juan sunny Spot, analyst of Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 would be able to close the year more near the 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the accounts receivable and to the traditional contributions to the pension schemes that are produced every year in these dates.
Nevertheless, the expert qualifies that the things will be somewhat different this year since believes that the rally will be in advance of the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that the volatility be going to affect to the tendency of the market.
In turn, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Bank, values that we are near of technical levels and "therefore we would be able to see a repercussion of the index that would be able to be seen prompted depending on the news that arrive from the United States as for the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst trusts in which these be positive.
The analysts agree at the moment of to elect the values that will be the responsible for carrying to the Ibex toward new maximum elevations.
Sunny spot, of Intermoney, affirms that "this year touches to the large values".
The expert would include in the accounts receivable to the two large banks and to some construction companies "because when the date he arrive, the electric sector he will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Bank assures that the ascents will come from the hand of the banking and of the industrial sector.
The construction companies will also be able to be benefited of this rally, in case to be given.
"ACS carries various months recovering positions and we expect that other construction companies as Ferrovial and FCC continue its same road", explains the expert.
The cyclic consumption will be a protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase of the sales in the season of Christmas sales.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technological also they will do it very well although in this case there is not a lot of representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven year
In the last seven years, in only two occasions December has been a downward month.
The authentic year end rally lived itself in 2003, exercise in which the stock markets you left of the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered a 28,17%, December registered a recovery of the 6,68%.
There it will be that to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex rises a 8.36% from January) and if its year end rally manages to include.

While, it is on the verge of closing an agreement with the unions to close the 75% of its offices Saturdays in exchange for open an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the experience of Popular will be decisive so that other companies be aimed or not to this initiative that supports the schedules of the commerce.

Grasping the private clients that move for these zones to carry out its purchases, to the pymes, autonomous and commerce of the chosen streets for open.
The bank wants to have these 200 open offices in every Spain in some 18 months, since are not new openings but restructuring of the already existing.
For it, the company will modernize the branch offices that already has in business districts, adapting them to the profile that feel the clients of the different streets.
In this way, the enlargement of the schedules accompanies by itself a different conception from the space of the branch office and a new design, up-to-date, with more luminous colors.
The responsible for commercial banking, Angel Rivera, assures that this restructuring does not suppose a great investment, although if a greater contracting of personnel, since is passed to have some six employees by localities to eight or nine.

Popular account currently with 2,500 branch offices.
And other 60 that operate under the mark Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very extensive schedules, that even they open Sundays and festive.
In these localities of PopularMax they will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of their offices they include a great fan of products not financiers for their sale.

Telecinco doubles for the first time the value in Market of its rival Antenna 3
We have obtained it'.
With that phrase expressed yesterday its satisfaction Paolo Vasile, delegated counselor of Telecinco, to the closing of the market, when verified that the chain that directs duplicated the value of its rival one, Antenna 3.
Only an aspect blurred its happiness: 'It is what hurts me, is not because we have grown more but because we have descended less', affirmed.
Even so, did emphasis in which in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finalized yesterday the day with an advance of the 2,54%.
That profit situates its loss in which we carry of year in the 15,66%.
The value in Market of the business controlled by Mediaset (with a 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) reaches thus the 4.488,88 millions of euro, according to data of Bloomberg.
Its rival Antenna 3, that yesterday yielded a 1.52% and accumulates a lowering of the 40.5% from January, slope the half, 2.193,46 millions.
The value of the other businesses of communication quoted elevates to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 millions Hurry (publishing of Five Days) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 itself due to that 'we are speaking of two similar businesses.
The relative fact is how much we are capable of doing, in the same market, why price and how we profit it in terms of audience'.
Telecinco announced last week that foresees to be converted this year in the first television network in surpassing the 1,000 million rough advertising incomes, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the delegated counselor of Telecinco and of Publiespaña, the subsidiary that negotiates the publicity of the group.
To be done real this data announced, the television network would register this exercise an increment of the 3.6% in its billing of publicity regarding the 965.4 million the exercise 2006.
In turn, the net billing of Antenna 3 enlarged a 1.6% in the nine first months of the exercise (until reaching the 734.4 million) while the net incomes of the television grew a 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that aim the analysts for the best relative evolution in Market of Telecinco is the high pie out that has maintained up to now: in 2006, the business presided by Alejandro Echevarría distributed the 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although is quick to decide, this ratio would be able to vary after the purchase of the 33% of Endemol in association with its headquarters Mediaset.
'We have the official commitment to give as a minimum the 50%, although always we have declared a lot more.
This year, I expect that we be capable of leaving happy to our shareholders, to the ones that already we have given value with the 33% of Endemol'.
According to the analysts, the market gives samples in these moments of certain exhaustion.
Lehman Brothers reduced recently its estimations of benefit on Telecinco in 2008 a 4% and in 2009, a 7%.
It is owed, they explain, to that has trimmed the growth predicted of incomes from the 10.5% to the 8.4% in 2008 and from the 5.5% to the 5.1% in 2009.
This same firm has descended the Antenna profit forecast 3 a 4.5% in 2008 and a 7.5% in 2009.

Ibersecurities: recommends to buy both values being based above all in its high profit value by dividend and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Box Madrid: sees better to Telecinco (to accumulate) that to Antenna 3 (to maintain) by the 'attractive multiples' and rise of the business.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends infraponderar in both cases upon having 'similar threats' (market saturated and worse economic climate).

Bond accepts to head the candidacy of the Spanish Socialist Party by Toledo and to preside the Congress if they win the
The former minister of Defense José Bond has accepted the offering of the president of the Government and secretary general of the socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the Spanish Socialist Party by Toledo for the next general elections and to be a president of the Congress in the case that the socialists win the general elections.
Thus they have announced it in press conference the secretary of Organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, José White, and the own Bond, after the meeting that has maintained this noon in the federal headquarters of this party with Shoemaker.
The leader of the Executive has justified the offering to the former minister because "is important to include the better" in the political life and Bond "is among the better".
Besides, it has aimed that "yes seems" that the politician of la mancha will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside the Congress if the socialists conquer in the next elections.
Bond would substitute as the president of the Congress to Manuel Marín, that make public last November 15 its decision of be not presented to the next general elections and to abandon its career in the active politics to be dedicated to fight against the climatic change in the university environment.
The former minister has recognized that the president of the Government has not left to insist so that he returned to the political vanguard since he abandoned it two years ago.
Besides, it has indicated that, just like the citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, its parted has wanted to announce who will preside the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If it reaches the charge, Bond expects to convert the Camera in "the house of the respect and not of the insult or of the shout". and to do that "each time seem more to the citizens".
"At times sadly seems that the only localities of Madrid where themselves cannot be spoken with tranquility and with calm is the Congress, to the president of the Government in certain occasion they interrupted him in the Senate 26 times".
Likewise, it has had words of compliment for their current president, Manuel Marín and "their good one to do" and has not wanted to be seen already occupying their position for fall not in which, has indicated, its adversaries would be able to see as "high-handedness".
Climatic publicity
It given that the movement against the climatic change submits to merciless so much pursuit to the skeptics of their predictions as to the ones that prioritize other social and political battles, is obliged to show a coherence of iron.
And more a leader of the movement that is a president of the Government as the Shoemaker and believes that that fight is more important than that of the Islamic terrorism and even is proposed to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach obliges to explain why the action, or the inaction, of its Government they have contributed decisively to that Spain head the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who are the responsible for the breach, in what sectors has been produced and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, it has not avoided.
Besides, it requires to explain with the maximum clarity to the Spaniards which are the measures that is going to take to brake the climatic change.
What businesses will be seen affected, what civic habits should be changed, what individual energy savings and collective we will be obliged to do, what economic consequences will have.
That is to say, who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But neither has had neither there will be those explanations.
Exactly because it is a matter of being sacrificed and of paying.
The measures against the climatic change, the real measures, they are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and minatory for the accounts of businesses and individuals.
To the hundredth one of the gasoline suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party has seemed so dangerous electorally Shoemaker that has hurried to deny it.
That is to say, that is a matter of saving the planet with the nothing, with pure publicity, with empty slogans of real every consequence.
With stunning phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, that Mister so useful for the electoral campaigns that neither speaks neither denounces neither requires, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
Provided that be limited to be an only virtual party to the contract and intend not that we displease us in bicycle or we refresh us with the fan.

The public prosecutor of the Balkans

How sure agrees me?
The auto insurance, that covers the conductor before possible sinister, supposes an important expense that will depend on diverse factors, such as the age, the sex, the antiquity of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to assure or the use from to this, among others.
Having the car only is the principle.
And the fact is that, to choose the adequate auto insurance is even more difficult than electing the model of vehicle.
In the first place one must have clearly of what we are speaking.
The insurance of car is an agreement between an insurance company and the policyholder.
This commitment materializes in a contract of insurances, that establishes that the company receive the value of the cousin agreed in exchange that hold responsible itself of the obligation to pay the compensations in case of sinister.
The cousin is the price of the insurance, which is established keeping in mind diverse factors, such as the age, the sex, the antiquity of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to assure or the use that itself him from to this, among others.
The companies insurance companies establish their prices in function of the statistics, so that to greater probability to have an accident, greater quota to credit.
It is for that so much reason why the greater of 25 as the women should pay lower cousins, since the statistics reflect that they have a smaller index of accident due to their prudence.
Likewise, making use of the recounts, the companies have come to the conclusion that the married people tend to have less accidents than the single conductors.
The use that itself him from to the vehicle will influence in the frequency, and with it in the probability to have some type of mishap.
Upon enlarging the frequency they enlarge the odds.
They are many variables that the insurance companies keep in mind at the moment of to establish the price of the cousin.
It is because of it, that the conductor should study well the situation to choose that auto insurance that better be adjusted to its profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables at the moment of to elect one or another type of insurance, so that this, besides being adapted to the characteristics of the policyholder, a reasonable price offer him.
The youths less than 25 years are found with diverse objections at the moment of to hire an insurance to an accessible price, like they are it reduced experience in conduction and the antiquity of the card.
Although it ideal to be well policyholder is an insurance to every risk, other more economic options exist.
The conductors more precavidos can opt for an every risk with franchise, so that they obtain the covers of an insurance to every risk but to a more feasible price.
This class of covenant would suppose that the client pay a part of the amount of the sinister one.
"The part of the amount of the sinister one that contributes the client itself preestablecerá in function of the value of the cousin, that will be higher as much as lower be the amount", specifies Luis walnut tree, chief in Spain of First Europe, mediator of sure online.
Another option is an insurance to third parties expanded, so that the client is assured the protection before damages caused to third parties, although not before them caused in its own car.
Besides, would be covered by robbery, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A counsel.
If you are less than 25 years tries to be careful and to avoid the sinister in the measure of the possible thing, since this will result in the bonus, being able to reduce the price of the insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the rate base that possesses the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on said rate base.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and of the benefit of this.
If the company has had a good year will be able to be permitted to enlarge the bonuses", clarifies walnut tree.
They passed the stripe of the 25 years the conductors have the easier at the moment of to hire an insurance, since the index of accident is reduced thanks to the experience accumulated.
By this reason, it more recommendable is to hire an every risk with franchise.
"Normally the youths cannot make use of the experience previously acquired at the moment of to be been worth in an accident, and even at the moment of the conduction", assures the director in Spain of the European company, to what adds that the majority of the accidents they are produced in the second year of conduction, once passed already the 'fear of the novice'.
Nevertheless, if the client is married but does not yet he have children he is preferably that negotiate an insurance to every risk, whenever its economic situation be permitted it, clear is.
In turn, the marriages with children are you considered by the insurance companies as the public with smaller index of accident, for which the surcharges will be smaller.
In this case the best insurance would be one to every risk with franchise (being able to be this of 300 euro), or, when have a high level of bonus, one to third parties expanded from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed conduction and they have a greater purchasing power to be permitted the luxury to assume a quantity of greater franchise", sentence Luis walnut tree.
For them they retired is recommendable an insurance to every risk with franchise (being this of 150 euro), or one to third parties expanded when have a high level of bonus.
One must say that the auto insurance is somewhat important, not only because covers the conductor before possible sinister, but also because represents an important expense, reason by which is fundamental to study adequate the insurance that more agree us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic search in Milan a point that is worth the eighth
Milan and Celtic they are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that lacks to achieve its respective objectives in the closing of the pool of the 'Champions', since to the Italians serves for be first and to the Scotch for sentence its classification.
The Italians add ten points and already they certified in the fifth day its pair with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to be assured that the Shakhtar, with six, and that receives to the Benfica, that has four, him not ahead.
These two parties of the Group D will be played a week before finish all the sixth day, since the Milan has to dispute the World one of Clubs in Japan, where debuts on the 13 in semifinals in search of a plaza for the end of the 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before that the remainder and the tie in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to leave to by a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would remain first and a better crossing would be assured in eighth.
To the assembly of Gordon Strachan would be able service even a rout to be classified if the Shakhtar does not win, but will not be able to be trusted because to equality of nine points the pair is for the Ukrainians, that lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they won (2-0) in the other direct sorrow.
Thus, the milanistas will try to embitter him the night to the Scotch, that trust in becoming in eighth for the second time in it restructured Champions League and of consecutive form, after exactly to be defeated in that round it passed campaign with a goal of Kaka in the overtime (1-0) after the 0-0 of the departure.

And the fact is that the Benfica, in spite of being last and without options of continuing in the maximum European competition, would be able to reach the third plaza with a victory, with what would play the UEFA.

New fears on the gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute by the price of the gas between Ukraine and Russia, enlarges the risk that affect the export of the fuel to Europe western on the part of Russia.
The majority of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, for which each close contact among both nations is source of attention.
Kiev has notified that if Moscow enlarges the price of the gas, Russia will have to pay higher rates of traffic.
A dispute previous last year reduced the supplies to the states of the EU.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopolistic owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree the quantity of money that should pay Ukraine by the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom declared that will charge more to Ukraine, since this has compromised to pay a 50% extra in 2008 by the gas that comes from the neighboring one Turkmenistan.
The analysts say that could be that Ukraine pay a 40% more by the importings of Gazprom.
"It is important for we to use our arguments as one of the most important traffics for the gas during the conversations" the Minister of ukrainian Economy said Anatoly Kinakh to the agency of news Reuters.
"The changes in the prices of the gas should not be related to our arguments on the levels of the rates of traffic [toward Europe western] way Ukraine".
The last one great dispute by the gas between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut the provision to Ukraine in January of the 2006.
This signified a fall in the exports to Europe western, what rose quickly the prices.
The Russian gas represents one fourth of the supply of the EU.
Russia has the greater reserves of gas of the world, but good splits of her not yet is completely developed.
As a consequence, Gazprom complements its own supply with gas of Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations of Asia Central.
NHS "should test the foreign workers"
The NHS Scottish needs to control the registrations of penal antecedents of the outside employees of Europe, a guard said.
The recommendation of the general auditor Robert Black came after was verified that a foreign doctor was related to the attack to the airport of Glasgow, in June.
Black also showed its worry that the NHS Scottish does not have exact idea of the quantity of foreign personnel with which counts.
Nevertheless, its report indicated other controls that are carry out correctly through a sample of five authorities of health.
The general auditor checked the quantity of foreign personnel hired out of the European economic area, because of the attacks to the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor of the Hospital Royal Alexandra of Paisley, was arrested in the airport after colliding a jeep in the doors of the airport terminal.
He was one of the three doctors that acted in the Old Bailey by video conference in October, defendants relating to the supposed attacks with car bomb in United Kingdom.
NHS expects to carry out the checkups of pre employment to the candidates, to be assured that they comply with the cualificaciones, the experience and the authorization to work in United Kingdom.
Although the meeting of health of Scotland utilizes "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out the controls of penal antecedents, the agency does not have jurisdiction for obtain this information out of Great Britain.
The report of the general auditor recommends, among others measures, that the meetings should include the guide of the Criminal one Records Bureau, that helps to the employers with the penal controls in many countries out of Great Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal registrations with evidences of these controls, this is not a routine review", the report says.
Black declares that the NHS Scottish has a high level of compliance of its own politics of employment, but indicates that: "Our report puts of relief the areas that can improve to guarantee that has the necessary information in the number of foreign personnel of the NHS."
The president of the BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said that was "very little probable" that the checkups of pre-employment can identify to employed potentials of NHS that could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that the checkups of pre-employment function in NHS Scotland but is not clear which is the value added of the done recommendations", explained.
The authorities of Scottish health declare that at present they include 1,161 foreign people, the majority of them medical and nurses
But the general auditor notified that the number can be higher, in part because the meetings have problems in identifying which are the employees that include authorizations of indefinite residence.
The investigation also found that the procedures of verification established by the authorities of NHS in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were complying extensively.
This includes the controls of passport, work permit and checkup of cualificaciones.
The Scottish government at present is revising the politics and guide of pre-employment of the foreigners in the NHS.
The secretary of health, Nicola Sturgeon, declares: "It had a great interest that this work because of the terrorist attack of the airport was carried out of Glasgow.
It added that the Scottish government, as a group with the meetings of health, they would be able to consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the updating of the pre-employment control guides for all the working parties - including the foreigners- what anticipated to publish the next month.

Climate of Venus can give an idea of the future of the Land
Venus could have been once an appropriate place for the life, declared scientists yesterday.
The data of a European spaceship in orbit showed to the most seemed planet to a twin of the Land of what had been observed previously.
Venus is the planet more close to the Land.
The two planets have similar size and they occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly more near the sun.
It does millions of years, Venus could have had similar conditions to the ones that did of the Land a habitable planet, believe now the scientists.
But the effects of the dioxide of carbon and the effect greenhouse, the atmospheric erosion by the solar radiation and the slowest solar rotation sent Venus to a type of very different development.
Today the planet does not have water, the temperature of the surface is sufficient to melt leads and is eroded by the hurricane force winds and storms of rays.
The results of the European Spatial Agency for the Venus Express, that has studied the planet by a year, offers a panorama of how the Land would be able to develop disastrous changes on account of the climate.
The professor Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics of the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the mission Venus Express, declares: "Reason is being clarified the climate in Venus is so different from that of the Land, when are two so similar planets.
"Our new data make possible to build a setting in which Venus began as the Land, possibly with a habitable environment he does millions of years."

Still remains open
Mitt Romney says that is not worthy that the presidential candidates respond the questions of a monkey of snow.
Nevertheless, the republican candidates for the presidency eventually agree to maintain a debate in YouTube, in which common voters and currents record questions in video and they send them for their diffusion among the candidates.
None of the questions presented in the afternoon on Wednesday 28 of November they were more ridiculous than that of the monkey of snow that asked the democrats about the climatic warming-up in the debate of the republican party of YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the republican party with a view toward the elections of the next year.
Themselves it is not known exactly how the producers of the CNN, that co-sponsor the debate, they chose the videos of YouTube to show the candidates to contenders.
But the first half an hour of debate, the most long one dedicated to a single theme, was focused in the immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
CNN asked to a group of undecided voters that to rise the dial when ideas listened that pleased them: the transmitters noted peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The hardest exchanges of words at night were given among Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, that has been a leader in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of Romney therefore was soft with the illegal immigration when was Mayor of New York.
It attacked to Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in its house.
Both they responded aggressive when they asked if some candidate would be able to support an "amnesty" (permitting to the illegal to normalize his situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining the citizenship).
The smaller candidates as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressperson, and Tom Tancredo, a congressperson of Red, they achieved agreement with the theme.
None has the word of to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the career perhaps because both alerted on the theme of the immigration before that the other.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share points of view: increase of the caution in the borders, intolerance with the illegal immigrants.
This topic, next to the fear to the toxic toys of China and other worries by the outside, aid to the republicans to forget, or to minimize, the divisions between the liberals and the Christian conservatives.
But the debate was transformed into uncomfortable when other themes appeared.
To Mr. Guiliani asked him why had supported the control of weapons in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated about if the immersion in water should be considered a torture.
A person asked if the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This carried to the Mr. Giuliani to trip toward the position that to though the Bible was its favorite book, the did not believe literally in the history of the Jonás and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee -now, against all the expectations, in the first place in the most recent survey of Iowa, thanks to its Christian conservatism of long dates- said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When it was pressured to respond if Jesus would be to favor, the he laughed saying that Jesus was too intelligent like to be candidate in the elections.
The career continues unusually open.
The Mr. Huckabee enlarges in Iowa, coincidentally with the funds collection campaigns of the liberal one Ron Paul, and its heated statements of the debate on Wednesday.
They two have left since the fund, because the two wings of the party did not arrive at agreement on the traditional and most famous candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined with the early party and convincingly with a winning message on the greatness of America, satisfying to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from being clear.
Labor pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit in which to be sunk; but likewise emerges
As the political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influences, neither is a matter of exhorbitantes accounts of hotels in Paris, neither suctions of extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the party of English labor government, of more than 650,000 pounds sterling (1.3 million dollars), by near four false years utilizing names, and that the party did not he denounce him.
Two months ago, when the prime minister eluded to call to an election, insulting stupidly the British intelligence declaring that the surveys of opinion did not influence in its decision, the hope was that would provide an efficient and strong government.
But instead of that, like Vince Calbe, the liberal democrat heads with growing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has passed to be Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in problems, showed the regulatory weakness and the poverty of judgment in moments of crisis.
Proposed evils to change the code of taxes has placed to the together, business groups, against the government.
The fiscal authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed a ducks administrative unimaginable.
A trio of retired generals they initiated a riot in the house of Lords, protesting against the courts in the military expense: to be ministers of the armed forces is, they demanded, an employment of half a time.
Now are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the labor secretary general (and previous accomplice) already has resigned.
Nothing of this signifies that the Mr. Brown walk irrevocable toward the exit.
The governments can arrive at a point of inflection after they be found incapable to govern.
The people does not believe them as the politicians, but usually they suspend their incredulity when a new lot assumes the control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve the things, that does not subtract a lot time, that suspension is useless: the public officials begin to fail; the ministers of cabinet are exposed; the press seeks bad news; and the government is put to the defensive and is not focused.
In a part, the position of Brown is particularly difficult, because as opposed to other political leaders cannot be defended arguing that is new.
Although it wanted to deny of Tony Blair, was its upper lieutenant.
The problems of the Northern Rock and the authority registration tax, they are related to the decisions that Brown did as the chancellor of the treasury.
And still when it is not directly wrapped in the misfortunes of Blairish -or "effective for associates", the investigation of the financing of the political parties - the voters can assume that if is it.
Nevertheless, the situation of the Mr. Brown is not as bad as seems.
The faux pas are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, nobody has died, neither he has been swindled directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what the tendencies naturally Stalinistas of the Mr. Brown have promised always: a brutal and reliable government.
The new political scandal of the donations is a good example.
The Mr. Abrahams, that compares its donations with gifts of charity, says that does not desire public recognition by its benevolence.
This perhaps it be thus, but the decision does not take it he.
The laws against the anonymity for the large political taxpayers is clear and exists for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to the ones that have the power.
The Mr. Watt, that said to know about the agreement of the Mr. Abraham, and that this was not illegal, obviously will face to Jon Mendlesohn, funds collection leader to which was asked him on the donations in October.
But the Mr. Brown up to now is not implied: there is nothing that sugiera that knew about these actions, although the thickness of the payments was done after he took control of the office in June.
Up to now the prime minister has done the half of the work.
It has been fast in condemning to its party by violating the law, but is diluted in it takes of decisions by a family matter, a commission of investigation on the matter -conducted, in good measure, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violet, is a matter of the police.
Besides, there are other things that the Mr. Brown should do, as to find a permanent and independent leader for the Commission of Norms in the Public Life, therefore has not had one since six months ago, and besides should pressure for a genuine reform of the financing of the parties.
This will require an arduous cooperative work of the laborists with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation to the special financial situation that has with the unions -bitter measures for a partisan one as the Mr. Brown.
But he should face some facts partidistas.
The conservatives now have a good level of support in the surveys; he is two years old to win voters; and the only way that can move to the victory is in act with an impeccable probity and a solid competence.
Sharks cards
The crisis of the mortgages subprime ¿is infecting the American market of the credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, is natural that some flippers numbers swim touched around.
Today that the American market of the dwelling is in crisis, the predators have their looks put in the market of the country of the credit cards.
The analysts in Goldman Sachs calculate that the losses in credit cards can arrive at the 99 million dollars if the crisis of the mortgages subprime infects other consumption credits forms.
Signs of contagion already are seen.
There is a so much increase in the charges of cards as in the rates of delinquency, that measures the proportion of the balance that themselves they have not been paid off or that have more than 30 days behind schedule respectively.
HSBC announced last month that has taken 1.4 million charge in its business of financing to the American consumer, in part due to the weakness of the borrowers of the cards.
Nevertheless, is very early for the panic.
The slowness and the delinquency are in low levels.
According to Moody' s, an agency of qualification, the third quarter the rate of delinquency of 3,89% was almost a percentage point under the historic average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American law of bankruptcy of the people (2005) gave rise to an abrupt fall in the requests of bankruptcy, that at the same time represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of requests (and therefore, of slowness) would be growing again, or can happen that the conditions for the borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports payment rates solids, that show how much of their debts they pay the consumers each month.
And the confidence in the credit cards and the values supported by assets is quite firm, in spite of the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a firm researcher, predicts that the volumes of emission for the year 2007 will be near a 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between the mortgages subprime and the market of the credit cards certainly exists: the consumers like to charge the debts to the credit cards now that the credit companies are expiring.
But the transmitters of the credit card look at more the flow of liquidity that the values assets, so that the prices in fall do not drive necessarily a change in the deserving capacity of the borrowers.
Even they can work to surpass to the transmitters.
The incentives so that the consumers continue paying off the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a consequence, the payment of the debt of the card rises in the list of priorities.
The transmitters of cards can also respond fast and flexiblely to the difficult conditions that the lenders of mortgage, changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a retasación fast of assets.
"We are not going to awake a day and to evaluate again all the loans", says Gary Perlin, leader of finances of Capital One.
If a sudden infection of the subprime in the market of the credit cards is improbable, the risks of a descent maintained are a lot more real.
If the prices of houses are lower and a contraction of the credit they push to America to the recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a more severe future.
One must continue watching those flippers numbers.
British bankers declared guilty in case Enron
Three British bankers that went to judgment by their responsibility in the frauds with the previous leader of the financial office of Enron, Andrew Fastow, they were declared guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally they were found innocent of seven charges of fraud by coludirse with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to be enriched at the cost of the employees.
They were envoys to judgment in January.
But during the audience before the judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the district OR.S, each one was sentenced as guilty of colución in fraud.
The three old executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC in the Royal Bank, they became cause famous in Great Britain by the procedures of extradition that two years they lasted.

Initially, the charges against the bankers were of to have alerted in 2002 to Fastow that was objective of a governmental investigation on the fall of Enron.
The accusation against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent plan with Fastow and their previous upper assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a company of Enron controlled by Fastow, that was the maker of a myriad of frauds in Enron, that helped their spiral of fall in the bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British knew that would value in rise.
A company under the control of Kopper bought the interest of bank of the subsidiary in $1 million Dollars.
The bankers paid to Kopper 250,000 dollars by interests in said company.
According to the accusation, Fastow represented falsely to Enron, therefore the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest by its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million they remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and other.
The bankers charged 7,3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and other they received near 12,3 million, according to the accusation.
In January of the 2004, Fastow was sentenced guilty for two charges of conspiracy in the collapse of Enron.
The trio of British was arrested three months later.
Fastow is complying a sentence of 6 years in a federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and a month in Texarkana.
Each one of the three British bankers they should pay 1 million Dollars that requirieron to live in the United States while the judgment was celebrated.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies of the nation, declared in bankruptcy in December of 2001 after years of tricks in the accounting, would not be able to hide the debt of millions or to cause to seem successful its business that fail.
The collapse caused lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in posted values and more than two million as pensions.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the previous executive leader, Jeffrey Skilling were last years defendants attendants by their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is complying a prison sentence of more than 24 years.
The prison sentence of Lay by conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when died of an attack to the heart last year.

Surgery "ducks" could be cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the prior day to thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked at through the window of the restaurant "a little healthier" and saw how an ambulance rose for White Castrate Cod, two doors further down in avenue West Scott.
Suddenly, a car of the patrol of the police appeared.
And later another.
"Then I saw to rise the ambulance", said the Mr. Livingston, supervisor of the restaurant, that day Wednesday.
"There it was when I knew that someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Stream, of 41 years, assistant of the director of the department of the police of Newark.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, that not yet he is identifying by the police, but that works in the house from the 212 of the Av. West Scott.
The authorities do not yet determine what caused the death of the Mrs. Stream, but they wait for the toxicological test although the results will not be available until some as many weeks. It will help to resolve the mysterious death that has sorry to the upper rows of the police of Newark.
The lady Stream had been an assistant of the director of the police, Garry F. McCarthy, from September of 2006, and his voice was relative to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious", he says the Mr. McCarthy on Stream in an interview telephone Wednesday.
"She was my guardiana".
She protected me".
The Mr. McCarthy said that Stream was the wife of Jimmy Stream, a former-official of police of Newark that works for the Commission of Control of the Alcoholic Beverages, and that left two children of 14 and 11 years, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman of the public prosecutor of the Union of the County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine if the lady Stream died because of an unauthorized surgical procedure.

It has passed more than one week and the authorities have said little on their investigation or on the owner of the house, call Flower Margarita I Neuter.
The lady Walsh would not be able to say if the lady I Neuter has been interrogated for the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine what part of the house was utilized as medical consultation.
Wednesday, nobody responded at the door in the home of the lady I Neuter, where a wilted rosebush is located in the front of the house, and a Dalmatian barks in the subsequent part.
A drum blue labeling as "vanillin ethyl" - used like replacement for the vanilla in food and perfumes - was found in the door of the garage, next to a door that conducts to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang of hooks to a side.
The Mr. McCarthy said that when arrived at Newark after 25 years in the department of the police of new York, the lady Stream was of an invaluable aid to know the new insular city and her coarse political culture.
"She would say," you have to watch with this or that", he said.
"She always was here when I he was, and also when not.
Is embarrassing."
It is expected that the federal reserve will trim the rates to raise the Market
The actions jumped to both sides of the Atlantic one yesterday after the market expected that the federal reserve calmed the conditions of credit with courts to the interest rates, that were increased with the soothing comments of the vice president of the central bank of the United States.
The markets were loosened in London, New York and through Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, declared that the makers of politics should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the tension continued of the financial markets.
In a clear effort by calming down the markets in the middle of growing samples of markets of credit, the Mr. Kohn said that the recent turmoil was "in part invested by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October".
If to persist the upward trend, would enlarge the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate agencies and business, said Kohn.
The comments were taken by the investors as a sign that the reserve is list to inject fresh capital in the markets of United States and for do subsequent courts of the interest rate, for stabilize the conditions of the credit.
The observations also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the economy of the United States, like the sales of houses that reached the lower record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil was accentuated by a notice of Bear Stearns, investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, what equals to the 4% of its total labor, in a global reduction of costs to compensate the losses of its investments in the mortgages sub-predominate of the United States.
It is expected that only 20 of those positions they enter to London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones rose in 331 points, or 2.55%, to the closing to 13.289.40, while the extensive index S&P 500 rose a 2.65%.
In London, the index FTSE 100 rose 165,5 points, or 2.7%, to the closing to 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds sterling to the value of the leading companies of Great Britain.
The index Dax of Germany rose a 2.6%, and CAC40 of France was over the 2.3%.
Before, the reappearance of the tension of the credit in the markets after a strong demand in an auction of funds to three months of the European Central Bank was emphasized, that considered those loans to the European commercial banks in a 4.7%, the rate highest from April of the 2001.
The pressure to the Bank of England to continue the action of the federal reserve and the ECB and to inject funds extra in the stock markets in London, they strained the credit and the rates of the loans to three months "Libor" among the British banks, the rise signified the greater from September, of a 6.59%, after a constant ascent since November 12.
England takes with judgment the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here there are two dilemmas, each one as difficult as the other.
Who should strike to the Nº 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, ¿Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important set against the first test against Sri Lanka, ¿who should decide?
The second asks is prominent because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is in loan- with that private title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and to Michael Vaughan, the captain, for decide; and besides because the desk of Hugh Morris, director of the England, is beginning to fill of offerings to be become selector national, and if not, in one part.
The one that do not obtain the sixth place of bat will be unfortunate, but the life often is unjust and the sport also.
It is not easy to throw what does a man in the top of its profession, while another never he goes more alla of the lower level, at times for lack of luck more than by capacity.
Not only in the cricket the election is difficult, therefore judgments are required that always finish being subjective.
Is the just time so that Bopara raise itself?
It is just for Shah if he does him?
The same question would be able to do in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant executive youths with good degrees and that know well the business, they had to be promoted to the panel: only there is place for one of them.
Who does he should say which is a good level for a player of cricket, unless they give the occasion to be sunk or to swim to the following chance?
The figures naturally have a great influence in the decisions, but thus have also opportunities.
Inside a team, a player of cricket has to grasp the eye of the captain at the same time to take a wicket and a batter to obtain opportunities to change the order if wants to have impact as the player some day.
But to grasp the eye of the coaches is more complicated.
There were many that improved last season, for example, James Anderson, that plays surely in the first test even if Stephen Harmison is declared for fit and bowls as the wind in the networks.
Anderson took 32 wickets first class in 33 careers by each one to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both have had their high moments and they are able they expect more than these.
The play of Shah or Bopara in the stadium of Asgiriya can be only a question of opinion.
The option can break or to do the career of a man, or can signify a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and did it well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful careers, but was Paul Collingwood, fighting to be established at the same time who arrived to be become a player of importance, and in spite of noting a hundred double against Australia in Australia, can be still underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a discussion more in the session of today in the stadium of Asgiriya, they will continue their instincts of conservation and they will favor the greater experience of Shah besides the exhuberancia of the young one Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is its brilliant and valuable one tests of début of principles of the 88 in Bombay, 32 first class hundreds set against only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven younger years, and has excellent antedecentes against the spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten careers in its two shifts in May against West Indies in the test in Lords, its house as the player of the Middlesex, and that caused an immediate refusal of the selectors when Vaughan demanded its place for the following encounter, seemed to have taken of its batting something of him that in Bombay.
On the contrary, the team of Essex has joie of vivre in swords.
He is lit for nothing in the country of cricket and its attitude was summarized as when overturned its vehicle in an exposition for the sponsor of cars of the England, Volkswagen.
It suffered wounds of smaller importance and, likely a shock, but the first thing that caused was to remove its Vodafone (client, of course) and to call to Alastair Cook, its companion of team that looked at to the distance, to tell him with excitement: "¿You saw that?".
Bopara is the best player, he is including its slippery pair to have effects in its played that seem to satisfy it, therefore bats with confidence and ability.
Electing the adequate man is a thing, to elect the best moment, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of the selection.
My inclination would be to give to Bopara its opportunity, what does not mean that Shah not sobresalga, like they suggest the leaves of the tea, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring the refugees of return at work -and to the fight against Al-qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees of Syria began to arrive at Baghdad yesterday, expelling to them exiled that they remained without cash, without extensions of the visa and to the ones that they expected that the city to return to the normality.
Some even they had returned to fight against the militants that conducted them out of their homes.
In the station of buses of Mansour, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official convoy of the composed government of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees of Syria and Jordan that had returned in private transportation.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, sunni doctor.
"I returned today for which I saw in the TV and what I have read in the newspapers, on it happened in Baghdad and that is insurance now".
"They say that the army of Mahdi to stopped killing people", declares, being referred to the Shiite militia of the religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, that ordered its troops a momentary cessation.
Qassim to the Atwani, Shiite of 38 years and professor in the sunni area of Amariyah, returned with its two children because was impossible to renew its visa in Syria therefore the state does not want the Iraqis working in its country.
Its Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called it by telephone to tell him that an allied force of United States helped to remove to Al-qaeda out of their bastion to the west of the capital, and they pressed it to that to return.
One of the recently they arrived from Jordan was the leader of a Shiite and sunni tribe that had been conducted since its home in Sleikh to the north of Baghdad, by an attack of grenades, after he urged the citizens to be raised against Al-qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends they called me and they told me that had begun a militia anti Al-qaeda in Sleikh and that needed my support and that of my companions".
"Therefore I have returned today", declared Sabaah Alu Obeidi, of 62 years.
Many said to be attracted by the growing calm in the capital since the troops of United States guaranteed groups of "civic worried", armed and that work in cooperation with the soldiers of US to defend their neighborhoods.
But many declared to have returned by the denial of the visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1,3 million Iraqis were established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, of 51 years and father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion among them exiled, that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, asked to the Syrian government to impose restrictions to the visas of the refugees to oblige the people to return.
More than two and middle millions of people believe to have fled of the country because of the sectarian squads of the death.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop offering visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq", the Sunni said.
"I cannot believe in a government that supports the criminals that set on fire my house after I left it".
It splits of the reason of the cessation of the violence is that the Sunnis have been expelled of the Shiite zones and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
The fear exists that a sudden wave of refugees cause arise again the sectarian tensions and comience the fight.
The small one Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first one in the vocational training and even shines for the international orientation of its upper schools.
As in all the country, the sarlandeses lack only of an educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for fiftieth time to a not sarlandés that we are not franseses" - that was the ironic motorcycle on if same of the smallest federal state for its cencuentenario.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the educational system of the Sarre that in a study of the Institute of the German Economy (IW) call "Bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
In this way, the upper schools by tradition have good relations with the neighboring countries.
The university of Saarbrücken was melted in 1948 by the franseses.
Until today the students can finish here their university career with two or three dipolmas.
By consequence, the procentaje of the foreign students is high, of 15, 6 for hundreds.
Nevertheless, the number of students originating from the Sarre is over the average in the upper schools. Many of them do not have a bacillerato.
"In the Sarre takes advantage of the system of the professional education", says Axel Plünnecke, the experte of educational sector in the Institute of the German Economy (IW).
More than each five youths does its degree in the Professional School. Thus, it so happens that the Sarre is 7 points percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very extensive.
The offering of the double careers, relating to the number of population, is the better second in Germany.
In spite of the practical vocational training and a growing demand, the number of titled in Sciences of Engineering descended a third in recent years.
That was the reason by which the Department of Education of the Sarre obliged the schools over doing more publicity for the specialties in Sciences of Engineering.
"After the first study of STEPS, we carry out some reforms in the schools of general education", affirms a spokesman of the Department of Education.
Thus the government introduced you test comparative in all the country.
So that the children harm as soon as possible to study the last year of the called project "Kita-Jahr", this has no price. In the meantime, this model imitate also the other estades federal.
The comparison with the next studies will show if has enlarged the performance of the students.
According to the report STEPS of the year 2003, the number of backward students in school development desminuyó from the 29 to 20 percent.
But, in general, the Sarre did not improve a lot as other federal states.
In Bavaria, the students know to calculate better.
For displeasure of the sarlandeses, the report STEPS does not compare the know-how of the foreign tongues, although in this field they could achieve good results.
In spite of the fact that the sarlandeses are not French, the language of the neighbors is an obligatory subject in the secondary Schools.
Chávez changes the hour.
Póximamente in Venezuela there will be another different time zone to the remainder of the world.
December 9 the president Hugo Chávez leaves to modify the schedule in the South American country delaying the clock half an hour.
At present Chávez is remaining as a comedian in Spain.
As it has reported the Official Bulletin of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the hour will pass to less four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that exists in no another country of the world.
Among others things Chávez, like the enemy of the United States, justifies their desición saying that the United States imposed in their day the obligation to the world upon changing a complete hour.
Besides, Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the break of the relations with its neighboring country Colombia on account of the action with takes of hostages.
The nationalist of left said that would not maintain any relation neither with the head of state neither with the Colombian government until the conservative one Alvaro Uribe to continue being the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not permit me to do it", says Chávez, that is propelling a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country should decide Sunday in a referendúm.
With this reform would be able to expand enough its power in the country.
The reason of the conflict was the desición taken by Uribe upon withdrawing the mandate of Chávez in the negotiations with the guerrilla warfare marxist in which was a matter of the liberation of the hostages.
Sunday Chávez said criticizing that the decision that took Uribe has offended to Venezuela.
Also in Spain is spoken a lot on Chávez.
A new sensation cause call tone in the country: "¿Why yourself do not silence?", is the phrase that already have dischargeed half million of people.
This phrase pronounced it the King of Spain that felt uncomfortable by the continuous interrupcciones on the part of the populistas of left in the last Latin American Summit.
In 2007 the decrease of the real salary threatens the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease of the real salary threatens the German employees in spite of a strong joint.
The experts present a large quantity of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Foundation Hans Böckler, the German employees should count in the year 2007 with a lower real account-salary than the previous year.
"The fault of that is the weak evolution of the salaries, the increase of the Value Added Tax and the tug of the prices of the food and of the energy", he informed the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Investigation of the economic cycles.
Also the new loads of the insurance of unemployment can correspond the employees.
The Minister of Finances Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to diminish the unemployment insurance load a 3,3% upon passing from a year to another, turns out to be just and reasonable.
Naturally, the office of work has not to become again in an unpleasant situation, asking credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the party German social-democrat.
Tuesday it was make public that the rate of inflation with the explosion of prices in the sector of food and the petroleum by-products sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
Upon comparing the prices with last year, these they are enlarging a 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the Land.
In spite of his atmosphere is not adequate for the life, Venus is the most seemed planet to the Land, something that up to now he had not been presented. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls in the poles, the same that appear also in winter in the Land.
Already since three decades ago the investigators had the suspicion that could exist rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: discovered electromagnetic waves to the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays cayen of a height of 54 kilometers of a cloud and behind another, account Cris Russell of the University of California in The Angels to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of the life of Urey-Miller, the rays caused the life in the Land: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, had caused the amino acids that are the basic components of the life.
In Venus is not thus: if some day there was life there, that would have that to be in one of the first states of evolution", explains they Be Solomon of the Institution Carnegie of Washington.
Today, in the surface of Venus there cannot be life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 greater times that in the Land and in the surface temperatures of 500°C reign, oscillating in such a way that can be reached temperatures below zero.
"Possibly, Venus is a twin" diabolic" of the Land, but he continues being a twin", he said Russell.
The main objective of the mission "Venus Express" is to respond to the question by what Venus, so seemed to the Land by its mass and so great, has had a so different evolution.
As from the Nineties there was not alone, special missions for investigation of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November of 2005 was a very important step for the investigation of Venus.
The last results of the investigations that go to to be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to the opinion of the investigators, they underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This desmuestra also that the neighboring planets have more common characteristics with the Land of the ones that had supposed", reports the THAT.
In spite of the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, the investigators discovered in the south polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that revolves faster.
This phenomenon recalls to the flows of wind in the high terrestrial atmospheres of the poles, as describes a team of investigators of Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Spatial Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Land and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers results almost so large.
This planet also called star of dawn or evening star orbit around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its period of rotation is slower: a day in Venus equals to 243 days in the Land.
Although Venus with its superficial temperatures of 460 degrees and with its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not resemble a lot to the Land, the scientists leave from the base that both planets had been formed in the same conditions.
In the two planets had piled up water that in the Land remained in the oceans, but in Venus was dissociated in the universe.
While in the Land the dioxide of carbon had become stones of carbon, in most form Venus of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended the rally of Merkel with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight among the parties by the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
He criticized indirectly to the Party German social-democrat by his attacks to the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, worries about the reputation of Germany and therefore required that the great coalition finished that fight by the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present us as A nation divided", said Koehler to the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time Koehler showed its comprehension with regard to the reception of Dalai Lama by Ángela Merkel (Party of the Union Demócratacristiana) in September.
"Although I have a great respect to the difference among cultures, the human rights are of absolute force for me", said Koehler.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great equilibrium in meteria of the foreign policy, underlines the Federal President, defending to Merkel by the reproach that received upon carrying out a new politics with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance of the traditional course of the politics of A China.
China also knows it", said Koehler.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Exterior Matters (Parted social-democratic), had shown indirectly its displeasure by the reception of Dalai Lama and on account of it was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among others things, Steinmeier criticized the Union by its unworkable politics in the exterior matter.
The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery caused large lacks of understanding in the Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government did not only withdraw the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Parted social-democratic), the Minister of Finances of Germany, but besides, according to informative sources of the magazine "Spiegel", froze the call strategic dialogue of the foreign Offices of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Leader of Chinese Government, required the Federal Chancellor Ángela Merkel that to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as an error.
Affirming the position of China, Wen Jiabao said that Chinese would not accept that the European politicians to receive the religious leader of the Tibetan in its official position.
The actions and the words of Dalai Lama showed that is trying to divide the Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, that now includes also other provinces.
Schaeuble notifies that disturbances will be produced like them occurred in France.
You battle with the police in the streets, shots, burns of cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble notifies that disturbances will be produced like was the case of France.
The Federal Minister requires that he be done everything possible so that the social dissatisfaction in Germany be not transferred to the streets.
Barricades were done, the vandals shot with rifles to the police: after serious disturbances starred in by youths in France, the Federal Minister of Interior Matters, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Union Demócratacristiana) fears similar tendencies in Germany.
"We have to set us ALSO in which the social problems of our country take not the violent form".
"That we have to take it us in serious", said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all the youths unfold in the constant change of the social reality.
The Federal State, the federal state and the municipalities already are working with emphasis to resolve these problems, said Schaeuble.
That refers not sólamente to the integration of the immigrants.
"Of the Summit of Integration to the Conference of the Islam: all this already is giving its first fruits".
Still it is early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same problems edificatorios and sociological as occurs in France.
The youths starred in serious disturbances in the streets with the police to the north of Paris them you passed nights.
In Tolouse also they burned cars and public buildings.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany required greater efforts of the Federal Government for the integration.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, notifies of an effect imitator.
Is certain that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of all, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the index of unemployment among the youths of foreign origin less than 25 years is situated above the average.
One must occupy that have more positions of vocational training.
Kolat underlines: "We have to give a perspective to the youths".
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "exists a great social control in the families", greater that the French country.
Besides, the majority of the youths of foreign origin does not want to destroy what had built here its parents.
Kolat thinks: "But in spite of all, we have to be careful".
It is necessary "to offer the opportunity to the faster youths to receive a job or of vocational training".
In the meantime the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-him-Bel elapsed in a peaceful way.
Hundreds of police officers participated in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses flew over the territory.
The responsible authorities reported of three detentions, as well as of trash and cars burned.
Since the previous day a team of almost 1000 police officers is being in charge of the security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Interior Matters, announced that the police is going to adopt rigorous measures until he be necessary.
The night on Monday to Tuesday around 80 police officers they were injured by disturbances in Villiers-him-Bel.
The disturbances continued the following night in Tolouse.
The disturbance began for an accident of traffic Sunday, where two youths died.
According to information supplied by the district attorney's office, the death of the youths was not because of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The action very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition as for the content arrived at its last point and that one must expect nothing more than her.
But in what country the Chancellor lives really?
After his exasperating action, indifferent and without a lot content in the general debate of the Low Camera one must say: she does not live in the country that would have that to be governed by her.
As for the reproach that him was done for to have dedicated repeatedly to actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected him with a presumptuous phrase.
It said that that would be a provincial way and thus showed caused verified that does not want to understand what interests the critics.
In the Low Camera was declared of very clear form express train to all that that reproach was adapted.
Itself could not feel neither a most minimum interest, neither any type of feeling by the problems of the country.
But instead of that, Ángela Wolke was presented in this way: a very high politics that flees in the foreign policy and remains there without achieving nothing in concrete.
An example: the prevention of the climatic change: was praised a lot to itself by the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but does not say anything about how should be carried out here these goals in questions of climate.
In general, this way to be praised to itself- since two years ago the jefa of the Party of the Union Demócratocristiana has not been able to be permitted so much modesty.
Therefore it is impelled in expressions so that an impulse to the people arrive.
And in this way damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with the one that resolves the problems without being gone for the branches.
But in the kingdom of Ángela Wolke the interior problems are aparencias of little value.
The poverty of the children and the worries by the workers with low salaries?
To the unique thing that is dedicated is to speak on that theme using subordinate clauses.
It is impressive how many times is mistaken upon speaking when is a matter of the supplement for the children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three intents to be able to formulate a phrase more or less good.
Begins to trip "as if to have been in an unknown territory", when was a matter of more concrete information.
The section attack.
The two favorite, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, they did a clash in a heated debate of presidential preliminary candidates republicans of YouTube and now they should fear only a candidate of the exterior part.
Already since a principle the tensions among the candidates are noted.
Mitt Romney reproached its adversary Rudy Giuliani that this to have converted to New York in "a place of refuge for the illegal immigrants".
This, in turn, responded with serious reproaches: "Meant that its own house was a" port" for the illegal". Giuliani answers to the former-governador of Massachustes saying that he was who he employed the illegal immigrants without roles.

They return the founders of Krautrock.
The most famous German band of the years 70 continues their activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As revival was done a copy of "Live 1974" that was written in the best epoch of the band.
Already in those times they were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to an official food caused the sensation.
Each one of them has in front of itself its little box, its cables and above all its buttons.
In the middle is seated Dieter Moebius that is 63 years old and is dressed with a white shirt.
To its left is Michael Rother of 57 years, that has its laptop computer and the guitar.
To the right, looking at of the audience, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years of age, that is very busy with the board of controls.
Each one it contributes with its sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
At times, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It seems that this do not I bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for them they impassioned of Krautrock was the fact that the band Harmonia to do again music.
What one must reveal here is the following thing: the questions with precision have shown that the name of the band resounded in the mind of the people, but was not something as special as so that after 32 years the public missed it so much.
But why the Germans also cannot applaud to their alive legend of the seventies?
Above all because the ambiguous one Kautrock always more was valued in England and the United States that in its own country.
When the industry of entertainment granted a prize of music "I Throw" to the members of the band Can 2003 of Cologne by their work of life, in the room the faces surprised of the artists of German pop music could be seen.
And when Network Hot Chili Peppers thanked to the band The Düsseldorf und Neu!, all they opened the mouth with amazement.
Later Michael Rother passed the time in the setting during the concerts of Network Hot Chili Peppers as if to have been an old friend (of the band).
The ignorance in their country and the recognition abroad, they are a single thing.
A problem results to recall to this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times not achievement a great effect in the public, nevertheless, obtained it later thanks to the other.
Already a time ago Moebius and Roedelius had done music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and they had a name, Cluster, that promised a lot of fame.
At the beginning they touched in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Later, by economic reasons, they worked with a business of music in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
During a time, Rother had a trabajillo in Kraftwerk and later worked of guitarist in the band Neu! Managed to improve the fame of this German band that in those times was too much radical.
In 1973 Rother continued the musicians of Cluster in the exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, that is a ruin of the century XVI, they lived like the refugees of the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in the Comune I, where Roedelius could complain of its position.
That was more well a life of full artist of surprises.
They as say, a day appeared a song association pennant Harmonia of Ottenstein in the trash, that resulted to be a good name for the art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first one albúm was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "Of Lux".
In spite of the fact that the music was tranquil and simple, the band had financial problems.
The life as the artist was not alone to be known to itself.
The CD "Live 1974" was engraved during a concert in Griessem. Someone recalls that, in this recording participated almost 50 people.
Then Rother expressed its desire to propel Harmonia and to do occasionally trials.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against the customs.
In 1975 the band announces its separation.
Rother finished put in themes of esotericism and assured its existence with albums as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighties and since that time has had more success of the one that had Harmonia.
The recording in direct of the albúm in Griessmer, that one must thank to Groenemeyer.
Its business of music Grienland was put like goal to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as the music I live.
As the work of Roedelius, also the band Neu! was again discovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as band takes place in the House of the Cultures of the World in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures of the festival Wordtronics.
There it is Julian Take, the English, the old punk rocker and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There also it been present the Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all the influences of Krautrock to the following pop music been present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a since was empty.
The phrase of Brian Eno accompanied with the full special music the room: "This music is the certain only music, to her him partenece the fúturo".
There are photos where appears Harmonia with producers in a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of black and blank photos, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the fund there are three veterans that began to improvise again.
They do not do nothing but to set the microphones to the organ and to the battery to be able to produce some extraordinary tones with the aid of the apparatuses of effects that had built with their own hands.
At present the electronic music is as well as had to be.
Three people that deepen in the technique.
But that does not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbaric Morgenstern, in a musical environment coughs, is whispered and in a good moment of emphasis is sung "¡Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock already was always a term of English origin.
But never was a matter of rock.
Itself not the origin of the kind in the blues was sought, but in the schools of music (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing the social and artistic conventions (Cluster).
Who here shouts “¡68!" is also right, but now Harmonia preserve the calm.
In the setting reflects very well on what already is evident.
Where does it begin and where finishes the music?
That can break to one the nerves or to give some fast moments of luck.
To Richard Gere only cynicism lacks him more.
The two movies "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" they are dedicated again to the war in the Balkans.
But the two did not have a lot of conviction.
Or the concepts are set a lot in actions and tirotes or the two movies are demasiando exciting.
Richard Gere with its "The Hunting Party" can neither help in this case.
To the start there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, they continue being hidden in the mountain of the Balkans, but exactly there, in the dark interior of the country during the war of Bosnia, was discovered again the actor Richard Gere.
Finally we had lost view to the most good-looking man of the eighties, because nobody wanted to see it after his pleasant roles and of little importance in the movies for women and after many press conferences on the buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what pursues" (¿Why nowadays the titles of the movies have to be so long and nonsensical?).
The movie has a marvelous presentation for the view: in the fund, their role of reporter in the war is the presentation of what would be able to do Richard Gere, if the destiny and the industry of the movies had not been so merciful with him. He were a man whose times better than the life already passed, that as a monument of the ruin of its decadence conserved up to now most of their charm.
"The Hunting Party", in spite of this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" that is the German production and will also be presented this week, they result to be only a series of movies without success on the war in the Balkans.
The movie can be related "Moerderischer Frieden" in few words: is a matter of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) that want to save to a Serbia of the snipers of Kosovo, one of them acts very fast and that carries also to that fall in love with her.
The sense of the movie is lost for the actions and the cross-fires, although we celebrate that the Serbians be not presented once more as the unique guilty.
The movie is like the German series "Alarm quality Charges 11" without freeway, but in situation of war.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" can investigate itself, because in reality never there was a good movie on the war in the Balkans.
In another moment, with another director and with another author of hyphen (Richard Shepard in two charges), the history on the American reporters in the war that go to detect a Serbian called war criminal "foxy", probably could be a new one "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the histories surprisingly are seemed: the small teams go two times to the mountain to carry out something that cannot do the army and each time results a trip in insanity.
A reason of the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when to the start they present us to Simon Hunt, to him to whom do not they leave him to be simply a cynic with heart.
Not, the hyphen foresees also a loving adventure with a Bosnia Moslem that are going to kill then.
Then "The Hunting Party" is found very far from the reality, above all when in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive rapidity achieve what could not achieve for five years the NATO, the CIA and all the hunters of heads of the world, that was to capture the war criminal and to leave the Bosnian musulmanos so that avenged itself of a just form.
It is so badly, that give desires to appeal to the international cut in The Hague based on the crimes against logica cinematica.
Nevertheless, the proposito of the film is, in reality, one profondamente human.
The pelicula wants to condemn the fact that and they be even free, and stands out that the Americans and the French are not really worried to pursue them, due to that have arrangements politicos among them.
At times the good thing and the evil are so similar, so that to one comes to the head a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this peoma is a matter of a mask of an Asian devil: "In the gandes wrinkles of its front I see, sharing the feelings with him, that hard is to be evil".
In the movies as "The Hunting Party" there are also these devils but they show that hard is to be good.
The problem consists not only in the kind of the movies of war in the Balkans.
It does little in a newspaper published that all the movies on Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascoes.
It can be added also that never there has been a good movie on South Africa.
Almost always it is worth a rule: when a star is put for a region of crisis or by the fields of mines, then something appears as well as "Rangoon" with Patrician Arguette, "on the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Diamonds sangrientes" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a brief period of time.
They have to pass at least decades until Hollywood roll a good movie on the holocaust having as an example the movie "The list of Schindler".
Some movies already need more time. The classics as the works on the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times they were not celebrated unanimously like the masterpieces.
Nowadays perhaps we know too much on world conflicts, and therefore in our times each killing (Massenmord) comes presented directly in two televisions at home.
And that is because the authors of hyphen do not have the smaller objection (that is necessary to be able) in relate good histories.
"To be or not to be" or "The great dictator" they resulted in the end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet they know that so evil was in reality the Nazi state.
Perhaps itself should not to be a good person to make a film.
Perhaps one must be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with its distant and sarcastic look of an artist.
When they asked him on the parallelisms among its historic novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, responded: "That itself due only to that some things do not change never".
The large cities will always be in danger, the men always go to to be murdered cruelly and in Yugoslavia always the war will reign.
Von Beust receives as answer the negative criticism on the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of the politics and economy by request not the Olympic Games of the Summer.
Many want to continue fighting for the competitions in the section of aquatic sports.
But Beust recalls that one must be a realist upon reckoning the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, general director of the chamber of commerce of Hamburg, declared Wednesday this renunciation as "not good for the economic court summons".
Lately no another project in the great city promoted as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective would not be able to maintain the sports, political impulse to the same level".
Schmidt-Trenz required to the senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time".
Wednesday the mayor Smells von Beust maintained their statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Olympic Games of the Summer themselves were not carried out to at least the year 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but the German Confederacy of Olympic Sports decides it", says von Beust in the WELT ONLINE.
It remitted to the decision of the Confederacy of sport (Sportbund) that expects at the beginning of December, on the request of Munich for the Olympic Games of the winter of 2028.
"This preference signifies for us that in this period of time, that up to now we thought to have until 2028, since the realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity".
In spite of all, this dream did not finish for always, said von Beust.
The Confederacy of sport of Hamburg (HSB) regrets the statements of von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to request the Olympic Games.
"It is too soon to leave to remove the opportunity, if at this time the plans are ruined", Wednesday said Günter Ploß, the director of HSB.
A renunciation of the request turns out to be contradictory to the statement of the leader of the senate that did in a reception because of the general meeting of the public Confederacy German of sport of the upper schools (adh).
There von Beust appointed the request of Hamburg for Universiadas of 2015 not as "a substitución" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Alone last week the Confederacy of sport of the upper schools named Hamburg as a candidate of the request.
The Fraction of the Party German social-democrat (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached to the senate that did not take advantage of the so valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the senate delayed with the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses", they affirmed Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the representatives of the Party German social-democrat (SPD).
While the SPD always required a planning integrated of Olimpia for the small one Grasbrook and then the use of the houses built, the CDU underlined the importance of entertainment.
Just then, the request of Hamburg for the Olympic Games of the Summer of 2012 caused a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed on account of Leipzig.
Are not the boxes of wood.
Who relates the terms Sweden and box of wood, thinks about Ikea, but does not think about Andy Warhol.
Or yes?
At present the boxes of wood produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the list of works of Warhol.
Most of the ninety-four Shine-Pit of "type" of this list they are false.
After some months ago the swedish newspaper "Expressen" put the doubt on the authenticity of Shine-Pits of the year 1968 of Andy Warhol, the Modern museum Museet of Stockholm carried out internal investigations and arrived at disappointing conclusions: the six "Shine-Pits", that the former-director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to the Modern museum Museet, they are false, and almost a hundred of the other of "type Stockholm", Market of the international art, they result also.
The prehistory is too complicated with a confused relation between the artistic productions and patrocionadas.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York their first "Shine-Pits", painted the boxes of wood of red, blue and white, with the same sample that had soap dust cardboards "Shine".
According to Warhol, in the exposition of its works of 1968 in the museum Modern Museet were exposed hundreds of Shine-cardboard box. These did not it do them Warhol (on account of the expenses), but they were brought directly of the factory of cardboard of "Shine".
Did not it be a matter of works of art, but of copies (that were only some objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol permitted to produce in Sweden some Shine-Boxes of wood, but they were not exposed in the museum Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times speak now that almost fifteen boxes, that in that time they entered the art history and of the auction as original of the "Shine-Pits" of "type Stockholm" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them they were bought for more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén did false statements that in the year 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the boxes of wood that Warhol was left them him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exposition in San Petersburgo.
In this time Warhol already had died since 3 years ago.
Lars Byström, the leader of the conservatives of the Modern museum Museet, investigated six Shine-Pits property of the museum and also three of the swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they were printed and they ground their tight silver and later them they were painted to the oil with the paintbrush.
To the contrary, the structure of the copies of the year 1990 sample that the painting was applied with a roller without printing directly the tight silver. Besides does not be a matter of the oil painting, but of the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and they should be eliminated of the official list of Shine-Pits of Andy Warhol", says Lars Nittve, the director of the Modern museum Museet and adds that if The Commission of Autentificación "Andy Warhol Art" in New York will not arrive at some conclusion, the museum Modern Museet will classify these six boxes as the copies/objects of exposition".
Already in July The Commission of Autentificación announced in a formal way that accepts these "serious accusations" in which treats of cash balance of dust of soap.
But since that moment there all remained in absolute silence.
The rebellious soldiers are yielded in Manila.
In the Philippines the rebellious soldiers have been yielded that had been entrenched in a hotel in Manila and they had required the fall of the president Glory Macapagal Stream.
The ringleader Antonio Trillanes, that reproaches the president, the corruption and electoral fraud, a reporter told that could not respond for spilling blood.
The faithful soldiers to the government had assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundreds soldiers were entrenched since some hours ago in the building.
Almost the half of them, among them Trillanes, had Thursday judgment by to have tried a coup d'etat in the year 2003 that to put an end to in a failure.

Evidently the military police officers that should watch it had passed to their rows and they continued their riot.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and they required the fall of the president Glory Macapagal Stream.
The troops of the government blocked the neighborhood in the outskirts of the Noble Hotel.
The president called to an urgent session of the Cabinet of Security.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Adviser, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
"The people is enough", said Trillanes.
"We call to the people to pass to our rows".
The general one Danilo Lim, that before directed the troop of elite Scout Reangers, said that before long the other military troops wanted to continue the march.
The large critics of government called Thursday to a great demonstration against the president.
Since months ago its government receives reproaches by the corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a place that attracted all the attention by the riot that was tried against Stream.
The lifting failed after close 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines have had at least seven intents of coup d'etats against the chosen government in a democratic way.

That signified that both businesses maintained all the options, above all the participation to the corporation Freenet.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic association they finished to the middle of November.
