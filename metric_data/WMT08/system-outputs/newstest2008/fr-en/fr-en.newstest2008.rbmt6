The inflation, in Europe, slipped on the nutrition
The accelerated inflation, measured in the Euro zone, is principally had has the quick increase of the prices of the nutrition.
In November, the price increase, in the 13 countries of the Euro zone, was more important in comparison with the anticipations, apres a rate of inflation of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, indicated the office of the statistics of the European situated Community has Luxembourg.
The official anticipations indicated only 3 percent, communicated Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American central banks, British and Canadian, the central European Bank (CEB) did not lower the rate of guiding intéret while saying that the decrease of the intérets, with the growth of the prices of the first matieres and the decrease of the unemployment rate, would drive has the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The CEB would wish to maintain the rate of inflation to the under but close of two percent.
According to an analyst, this is Wrestling 22 for the CEB: "It is necessary to dissuade" the inflation in order not more to have has to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3 percent is a record during these twelve last years and in Spain, it is climbed back up of 3.6 has 4.1.
The inflation in the Euro zone took off legal successor of the quick increase of the prices of the nutrition and energy.
The market quotations has cereal term increased of 88 percent and the course of the soja attained equally his value the more student since 1973.
The price of the food oil and dairy products equally considerably increased in 2007.
This year, the world-wide price of the oil increased of 52 percent and, the last month, a barrel of now black coutait almost 100 dollars.
According to the CEB, in 2008, the rate of inflation will pass of 2.1, this year, has 2.5 percent but, in 2009, it will lower has 1.9.
According to the analysts, the rate of inflation on 12 months remains around the 3 percent, nevertheless, the 3 has 4 next months, the annual average rate will be of 2.1 percent.
In meme time, they expect has what the CEB diminishes the prime rate two times in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
Apres a long stagnation, the number of the favoring Fidesz (Alliance of the young democrats) increased significantly at the beginning of December. Thus since 2002, it disposes currently more big number of supporters, while Gallup (poll Institute) never noted beforehand a so weak socialist support, has to know 13 percent.
For the voters fideles, the difference would represent, because of the biggest determination of the voters of the opposition, a support of more than two third (71 percent) against the support of a cinquieme (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of the Hungarian democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of the free democrats) are at the under threshold of parliamentary ones: their support is of two percent in the whole population.
On the voters fideles certain to be going to vote, the number of the supporters of the two parties increased of 1 percent.
The economical climate continued to damage itself in comparison with the preceding point the more bottom, the proportion of those that judged that the financial situation of the country was specially serious also was never raised, she climbs herself has 41 percent and according to 46 supplementary percent the position is rather serious.
Apres the perspectives more optimists of the spring and last summers, the families are again more pessimistic according has their financial position.
For next year, the population majority foresees a worsening and only a dixieme foresees a position improvement.
In last December, 71 percent of the probed persons, has to know a majority never seen at the time of the previous polls of Gallup, judged that the Prime Minister did his work rather poorly that well.
13 percent of the probes have confidence or a lot of confidences in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent not at all do confidence to the Prime Minister and 27 percent to the president of the Fidesz.
One of the informers of the change of the political position is the corporation proportion thinking that the discontent lives-has-lives Prime Minister can etre treated without government change.
While apres the riots of last October, 35 percent of the probes wished that the government and the Prime Minister remain in function, currently this rate represents only 20 percent. The relative majority (33 percent) considers that the held new elections would be the solution has this position.
To the question concerning the vote intention, 60 percent of the probes reply that they would go certainly to vote and the 20 supplementary percent say that they probably would go to vote.
To do the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 percent of the probes would participate certainly and 15 supplementary percent probably would participate. Following the current intention, the referendum result would not do any doubt.
74 percent of the people would say not to the inscription rights in the higher education, 79 percent would say not to the expenses of consultation and 84 percent would say not to the stay expenses has the hospital.
When we look at only the memes proportions among the persons that expressed their intention to vote to the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 percent of the votes would reject the introduction of the rights of inscription, expenses of consultation and expenses of stay has the hospital.
Auchan is the dearest, Tesco increased its prices of pres of twenty percent
The established hypermarchés in the commercial triangle of Budaörs maintained the average increase of the prices of 16 percent of last year has the difference that this year the rate of the VAT did not increase.
Item of Napi Gazdaság (daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the Basket of habitual daily Christmas increased equally of 16 percent in average, an increase of clearly superior value has thousand forints posted itself in all the hypermarchés.
The prices, "that were themselves flown away déja" in the big stores of nutrition in last December, not more increased brutally by report has the preceding high basis.
Nevertheless, the consumers evidently are shocked to see that the items bought clearly to the under of nine thousand forints last year now more than ten coutent thousand forints.
The daily Basket in the probed hypermarchés surpassed of 91 forints, to the minimum, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the value the more student of the basket climbed itself has 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was of 6 800 forints.)
The prices of the Unicum and living fish remained practically at the level of last year, nevertheless the prices of the net of turkey, walnut and pavot strongly increased.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, with Auchan, one found bread of a kilo has 139 forints only.
The competition did not lower the product price to the under of 200 forints.
It was astonishing to see, equally in this hypermarché, that the price of the recorded bottle of two liters of Coca-Cola was at the under of 200 forints, it not coutait therefore that 257 forints the recorded bottle including.
It n'empeche only this year, in terms of daily Basket, Auchan was the dearest and Cora the less dear one.
Of apres our calculations, Cora increased the price of his daily Basket of 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan respectively increased them of about 18 and 18 percent.
While comparing the basket more dear of last year and the basket the less dear one of this year, we note a gap of 12 percent while the difference between the less dear one of last year and the dearest one of this year is of 21 percent.
The prices increased of 1 480 forints in average.
Last year, the prices increased of 1 206 forints in average, all while knowing that the impact of the increase of the rate of the VAT was done noticed déja in the prices of Christmas of the past year.
This process rendered perplexed the commerce, the hypermarchés could not determine visibly which margin to apply on products so they were incapable to foresee the impact of the change of the prices on the consumption.
(If a merchant calculates poorly the rotation of a product, it risks losing a big profit on the adapted margin has the commerce intensity.)
Because of the change of the rate of the VAT, the increase of the prices of the daily Basket evolved so excessive mania that the basket more dear was superior of 1 720 forints has the value of the one of 2006 while the difference between the baskets the less dear ones was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the basket value the dearest one was superior of 1 630 forints has the one of last year and the prices of the less dear one increased of 1 284 forints equally.
While comparing the two seasons of Christmas, we noted a disastrous increase of the prices, in less than 20 months the prices of the daily consumer items increased more than 30 percent in the hypermarchés.
(This does not confirm necessarily them given of KSH: for certain nutritions of first necessity, the statistics institute noted an increase of the prices of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
Such is the case for example flour and egg.)
According to the daily Basket of the latter, this appears almost absurd since the price level of this product, well dear déja last year, increased of has pains more than 10 percent by report has the basis.
According to the indices, the flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than the suppliers of eggs for they succeeded has to let the brutal increase accept of the prices equally by the multinational corporations.
In the triangle of now commercial, the hypermarchés do not complain, they record constantly good years.
Of apres our experiences, the majority of the customers no longer looks at the prices in the three visited hypermarchés.
They buy all in quantity, they take the foods of long conservation by palettes.
Wednesday morning of the important tails formed themselves to the cash registers of the three hypermarchés for the number of customers increased abruptly.
Now, according to our information, the sales is less important in province, many multinational corporations complain aupres of the corporations of poll of not meme to attain the foreseen sales, not only for the nutrition but equally for the durable consumer items.
Many hospitals do the economy on the disinfecting
This year, more than thousand infections, principally caused by the incorrect usage of the antibiotics, were recorded in the hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of the hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the surmenage of the medical personnel do not help has to block the infections, asserts the doctor in boss of the national Center of epidemiology.
Many hospitals do also the economy on the disinfecting
There is not a long time an infection MRSA was diagnosed to the trauma unit of the hospital János.
The resistant bacteria to the antibiotics was detected on a hospitalized man continuation has a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At first year a similar infection produced itself to the meme place.
The injured of a serious accident of car went out of the hospital but little time apres it has there to return because of an infection MRSA and, since, the doctors were not able to do him an important operation legal successor of the bacteria that is located in his organism.
Until December 10 of this year, 1 094 hospital infections generated by an agent pathogene multirésistant were declared to the national Systeme of supervision nosocomiale, indicated Karolina Böröcz, doctor in boss of the national Center of epidemiology.
To know that this is the number of infections caused by an agent pathogene multirésistant that actually was recorded in the hospitals and for the remainder we have no information.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by the MRSA, otherwise says by the staphylococcus aureus resistant has the méthicilline-oxacilline.
A third of the people are carriers of the bacteria of the Staphylococcus aureus (HIS) in their nose without developing a disease.
The infections caused by the HIS (such as throat infections, tonsilitis, skin infections, infections traumatiques) react well to the antibiotics, they are easily curable.
Nevertheless, if the antibiotics are used excessive or inappropriate mania, the bacteria, that reacts well to the antibiotics, will develop a well resistant bacteria to the antibiotics that will proliferate quickly in the bad hospital conditions.
In case of bad provisional or extended functioning of the immune systeme, this bacteria can cause hospital infections engrave, such as an infection traumatique or a septicaemia, on the elderly patients, of small weight or having a weakened organism.
According to the guiding doctor of the hospital János, it has not nothing special in the infections MRSA, these infections are part of the Newspaper of the hospitals.
It is not necessary especially to confuse the infection with the epidemic, one does not find any MRSA only it or one does not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The HIS withstand the antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the personnel caring for puts gloves in rubber and masks of protection and we have adapted antibiotics to care for them", declared Tibor Nyulasi.
To priori, the hospitalized patients are examined themselves they are carriers of MRSA, nevertheless the infection do not always can avoided etre.
The sample prélevement is not has the method
The big majority of the infections caused by the MRSA can warned etre but the conditions and the current circumstances are not favorable, in the Hungarian hospitals, to warn the development and the proliferation of the agents pathogenes multirésistants, asserts Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection shows itself especially in the hospitals and in the residences for elderly persons, the hospitals should check the hospitalized patients and isolate immediately the sick carriers of MRSA.
Nevertheless the prélevement microbiologique is not has the method in the Hungarian hospitals.
It is necessary to know that the national cash Register of social security does not finance these examinations.
Most of the cases sees the light of day only if the infection MRSA is detectable on the patient, declared the doctor in boss of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has relative severe recommendations has the adapted usage of the antibiotics in human and there exist medicine the Hungarian directives equally for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
It is necessary to do the efforts for that therapy antibiotic is targeted, otherwise says examinations microbiologiques would have realized etre in order empecher the resistance to the medicines but the hospitals not some always hold counts.
The realization of the prélevements microbiologiques is even rarer in the outpatient cares and in the basic cares, communicated Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals do the economy on the disinfecting
Scientific proofs show that the MRSA proliferent of a patient has another most often by the intermediary one medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash its hands, to put gloves and masks of protection. Nevertheless important gaps are detected in the hospitals equally in this domain.
The MRSA proliferent by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. Nevertheless, because of the conditions in the Hungarian hospitals, the contaminated patient do not always can isolated etre.
Of more, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too pres of one another while in terms of epidemic, the patients would have removed etre of one another of 1.5 metres to the minimum.
Unfortunately, we note equally that the hospitals, in difficult financial position, save money on the disinfecting, they lack infirmieres, the patients are numerous, thus risks it contamination is even bigger, indicated Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in the hospitals or the preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is weaker demonstrable mania or then the proliferation of the agent pathogene can blocked etre.
Governmental project against the MRSA
The treatment of the infection MRSA represents exorbitant expenditures for the cash registers of the social security, this is the reason why one fights everywhere against this infection.
In England, for example, the government established a program to warn or diminish the incidence of the MRSA.
According to the published data, this program is effective and the infections MRSA show a fading tendency in England.
The European Center of prevention and of check of the diseases (ECDC) does to appear among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of the agents pathogenes multirésistants (as the MRSA also) as well as the prevention of the hospital infections caused by these agents pathogenes.

Bulgaria, paradise of the real estate market of THE E.U.
The real estate Bulgarian market evolution is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned towards this country of the Balkans not very quoted by the passed.
What, or and that buys on this market of THE E.U. that always is the less dear one but that will become quickly dear?
Analyze Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the real estate one, Bulgaria is unquestionably the target the more in fashion of the eastern Europe with its apartments of skiing and its houses by the inexpensive sea.
In the mountains, the regions more popular are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albéna, the "Sands of now", the "sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are more and more numerous has to look for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik equally.

Sofia, the capital, offer timeliness attracting equally, the surfaces of commerces and of offices promise the rate of the highest cushioning.
Bulgaria is on the better way to become the one of the paradises of golf more attracted of Europe and etre thus a priority destination, apres the season of summer and the season of winter, equally in the two other seasons of the year.
The more vigilant investors buy déja in big number, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to the analysts, the persons buying a building in Bulgaria look for in meme time has to change their life, their life method.
Most of the buyers are English but of others arrive from France, of Belgium, of Spain and more and more of Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot investors are equally present. By the Black Sea and in the skiing stations the most renowned ones, we traditionally meet a lot of Russian buyers.
The foreign buyers divide themselves in three groups, said Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The people that count to install themselves buy the renovated buildings, has a price varying between 50 and 100 thousand Euros, or of old deteriorated houses, has a price going of 5 has 15 thousand Euros, that next are renovated.
The criteres are the easy acces and the communication possibilities, the proximity of a big city, stores and usually the one of the local doctor.
The deuxieme group understands the buyers of secondary residences (since last December, Bulgaria is quoted among the 10 first destinations of vacation in Germany).
The troisieme groups is composed from commercial investors that buy in the hope to realize a more worth one has average or has long term.
The price of the buildings of the capital increases continually owing to a more and more strong request.
In the European Union, the real estate prices are the more bottoms in Bulgaria. Nevertheless, these 5 last years, they increased of 21 percent each year.
The increase of the real estate prices surpasses essentially the increase of the salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent

In this moment, of lively discussions are taken has this subject between the countries in the process of development and the developed nations.

The transmission reduction would be delayed some and the increase of the average temperature of the Earth of more than 2 degrees celcius no longer can avoided etre that, according to the scientists, would have consequences extremement engrave and irrevocable.
The British army recruits on YouTube

The army is embetée for, except the videos composed and censored carefully, avid videos are passed on the division site that present equally, for example, the death of soldiers: in the publicity films "official", a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.

Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard increased the risk country
According to the Division analyzes risk of Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in last aout, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a better Hungary) increases, under several aspects, the risk politics of the Hungary and region.
In his "risk warning", the corporation signals that, related to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is déja than "has short term of ethnic aggressive clashes can produce themselves continuation has the worsening of ethnic tension déja existing between the gypsy population and not gypsy Hungary".
The research institute added that the strategy politics of the Hungarian Guard aiming probably has to provoke this position is the principal reason.
As they say, that explains by one of the principal gaps of the Hungarian political actors: "The public actors passed the relative public debate has the matter of the Roms to the political radical grouping representatives and extremes that based a political strategy on the disagreement between the Gypsy and the Hungarian one".
The probleme finds itself worsened, the normal dialog becomes impossible, the extremist ones see themselves reinforced and the arrival of the aggressive conflicts is more probable, they say.
Now, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media the activity of the Hungarian Guard "damaged significantly the picture of the Hungary has the foreigner, in particular concerning the confidence in stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, continuation has a bigger given advertising has the reorganization of the radical groups and Hungarian upright extremes since the fall 2006, many associations were constituted in Hungary since the summer 2007 giving themselves the name of "national association of autodéfense".
"The common trait of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization while they declare publicly the preparation of their adhesive ones has missions of defense (catastrophes, national defense, order defense), armies if it is necessary for it, moreover, while evoking the police inaptitude, army, otherwise says state", they added.
They signaled that all passed itself following the method that, while basing itself on the resentment of the corporation of the political one and on the part, looks for has to disguise different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The put accent on the civil caractere and the association statute does not serve therefore only that has to avoid the lawful pieges of the recording of these associations to the court but they constitute also a political strategy.
The analysis signals that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that increases equally risks it in comparison with neighborhood relations.
"The latter months, many countries neighbors quote the Hungarian Guard as a source of risk potentielle and the political actors ultranationalists of certain bordering countries wish to justify their political Anti-hungarian while referring itself has the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences stability politics of the region", they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phénomene in central Europe of the East, the political risks increased on the region body.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, has the activity of the Bulgarian national Guard of which the constitution was declared by the national Bulgarian Union (BNU) in aout 2007.
The numerous disturbances of Roms that have burst in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are has the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Profiting from it of these events, the BNU decided to constitute a guard while saying that the organization objective is "the national autodéfense".
According to them, these 17 last years, the gypsy ones have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state remained idle and neuter, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had given rise to lively debate in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration of certain organizations of Bulgarian Roms concerning the constitution of their clean guard by way of resistance signals the increase of the risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with the one of the national Bulgarian not excluded Guard that the Hungarian Roms react has the threat of the meme handle while organizing their own autodéfense, can one to read in the warning of risk of Political Capital.
To the request of information of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, director of research of Political Capital, said: the risk analysis is the one of the activities of the institute of research.
As it said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events produced themselves that could have an impact on the risk change, they inform the public opinion, as in the present case, while publishing a risk warning.
The fete is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days of fete and, around the fetes, it became current to reorganize the working days of which the number will diminish next year.
The fetes are not uniform in THE E.U. and to the not United States more.
The Hungarian legislation distinguishes the days of national fete and of state as well as the days of rest.
The days of rest often are secured has religious fetes or has important historic events.
In Hungary, we fetons the new year, the last day of the year that finishes and the first day of the new year are equally days of rest, the latter so much more for than the réveillonneurs quietly can rest.
Besides, in a year, we have in all eleven marked fetes in red.
March 15 is a national fete, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as October 23 also that is the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
The 20 aout, we fetons the constitution of our state, the 1st May is the fete of the work and the 1st and November 2, we remember members of our family and of our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days has Easter, has the Pentecôte and has Christmas.
The days of our fetes of state, national or again religious falling rarely on a weekend, according to the calendar, it became current to reorganize the working days in the cases or it remains only a working day before or apres the marked fete in red.
It is true that we pay the price of the extended weekend while working or leaving has the school the Saturday preceding during the weekend extended.
Since of long years, the work minister rules in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the days preceding or following the fetes.
The law spreads itself for all the employers and for all their employed employees, on the officials and on the persons working in the public service.
She does not be worth nevertheless for the service corporations, the institutions turning without interruption and in service, of by their vocation, and also for the days of rest.
This year, the days of work will be modified only around the fetes of end of year: has to leave December 24, life itself s'arrete practically in the whole country for according to the experiences the majority of the people does rather of the additional hours or takes vacation that they saved has these ends to be able to pass the days between Christmas and the day of the.
Next year a lot of fetes fall in the middle or has the week end, consequently it there less than changes at the level of the days of work by report has this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the work fete to allow the employees to remain at their place four days of keen one.
The Saturday April 25 will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Fridays May 2.
Another change is foreseen for October 23: the Saturday October 18 will be a day of work substitute on Fridays 24.
On the other hand, next year, the year end announces itself under the sign of the fetes for has to leave December 24, everyone will do a pause non-stop meme if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.

If you want to reply to the expectations, you no longer are interesting
One advances gently in the habitual cork in the morning.
All has blow, a special melody does itself to hear has the radio: the voice of a violin has which of the electronic effects are associated.
I brings up the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the low one arrives to accompany the tones of all has the hour, next a feminine choral one comes itself there to join as a true jewel.
Mr2 diffuse the song Wings of Coils Zagar.
Hungarian musical life not at all spoiled us during a long time with a pop electronics of good quality.
Now, now it appears that the cork becomes different if you listen the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the some new interesting productions born numerical Hungarian underground begin little has little has to change the overall picture and, in spite of the new method of the rock one of garage tearing the guitar, the Hungarian électropop proves that there is new one under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and it played him meme in the group of Yonderboi before it does not launch himself on his own way, can etre because "there is no room for two feet in a meme shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, of music dancing electronic and of pop one, began has to make itself known when one entrusted him the composition of the filmed soundtracks (p.ex.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The formation playing beginning in of small clubs began has etre known by a more general public when the magazine wan2 quoted their first album of 2002 among the fifty more important discs of the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost alone creators of the Hungarian tendency that would be so competitive has the west.
Zagar and his together became unquestionably "trendy" but no one asked for them themselves they wanted well to carry this label.
The group reacted as it is necessary, it has gone out a new one and better disc.
The entitled album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, gone out recently, can open new ways for them, although the title desires to represent a continuity with the past years has Pécs.
This is that it was a line of the former group of Pécs of Balázs Zságer.
We there are well with the reference to the flight but has side of the aerial music appears now, following the spirit and the era tendency, the stronger guitar, impact of the rock and roll.
György Ligeti, singer working currently in England with the group The Jigsaw, showed his talent in these songs at the time of the first one album to the thousand-year-old Park.
On the album, one finds a true tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, broadcasting since few the popular music in the morning to evenings, began has to introduce the melodies of Wings of Coils recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well therefore (?).
Hvg.hu asked questions has Balázs Zságer.
Hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me has to ask a question: your music well remained a music aiming a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The music term aiming a certain layer does not say me big thing.
For me it exists two classes in the light music; non-mainstream or underground, alternate or pop no but commercial music and music sincere.
The music oneself saying alternate, underground are able equally mediocre etre and done only to sell them and become thus commercial.
Now, a good pop song can etre sincere also.
The reception attitude works in this spirit equally regardless of the language or frontieres.
Hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian public and foreigner, the one or the other more is opened has your music?
Zs.B. : Abroad, especially has the west the light music has older traditions.
The, the people go to the concerts and not only the young ones of a ten or group of twenty of years but also the most elderly ones.
They follow with a lot more of attention the arisen changes in the light music for they think than she does equally left the contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: Which is the public role in your work?
Are you interested knowledge that, or and how many persons listen your music?
Zs.B. : I am evidently happy to see that the people come more and more numerous has our concerts.
Nevertheless we never did music for the market.
For us the music is not done to attain an objective but for a precise reason.
The public role is more important to the concerts or influence mutual insurance company works déja but she is perceived only in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to reply to the public expectations, you no longer will be interesting.
Hvg.hu: Do you count to follow the example of Yonderboi?
It works alone and did carriere rather has the west.
Zs.B. : We do not follow really his way meme so sometimes some try to find tracks in our music.
We are rather players in team that have confidence in the musical presence of the other and the leashes to deploy themselves.
At first, it was well on inevitable that our music is compared has the one of Yonderboi for we are several has to leave his group and has to take another way.
Hvg.hu: On the palmares of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Coils occupies the first place.
Numerous are those that heard the name of Zagar for the first time by the way of this song.
Did with this more popular style you open consciemment towards a wider layer?
Zs.B. : We did not foresee to do a tube to be able to sell the disc.
This song wants to say more things.
We wanted it for the final one album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the approached MORE DIFFICULT themes in the whole disc.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why was they - which the guiding line?
Zs.B. : The idea was to have a choral one kind gospel music.
We had the idea to compose this choral one of good soloists of the Hungarian musical scene.
Was thus composed the choral one has six members, has to know Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, that one baptized next Underground Divas.
Hvg.hu: You wanted this song as that or the girls modified it a little?
Zs.B. : This piece existed déja since a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that it lacked again something has this song.
The continuation agreed attracted song voice.
I sang the night meme the melody that the girls learned later.
I had it almost right away and all was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that that galvanized me has the era but well turn sour we needed the Divas.
With my voice she would not have had the meme forces.
Hvg.hu: On the disc and to the equally it seemed to me concert that the girls were in arriere plan.
There is not solo (has the exception of a brief solo of Judy Jay), they have not any only role, they sing at the same time and they do not sing stronger than the music, therefore the music does not do that to accompany their song.
They were derriere on the scene also.
Is this desired one?
Zs.B. : The Fact that they were in arriere plan is only has technical problemes.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute roles of soloist.
The song says equally that we must forget a little our ego, forget that comes from or, that goes or, it is just necessary to leave that these wings, the love wings, we take.
I wanted that the others feel equally this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
Hvg.hu: Which of the songs did you the more to work?
Zs.B. : To true to say, no according to the process of musical creation, we had more difficult pieces at the time of the mixture.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play has a piano together, or with Rock' n'Roll Goes à The Girls, or the groove did not want to work during a long time, and then, small has small, all set itself up as in a jigsaw.
Hvg.hu: Which is your favorite one on the new album?
Zs.B. : Ca changes the whole time with the concerts and on account of the fact that I have déja "loosened" this disc.
In this moment, this are Prophet I's HAS Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The tradeur perfide risked the billions because of his inferiority complex
A secretive swindler.
Thus designates his former employee the French giant the general Corporation, owner of the Czech bank banka.
The bank lost because of him close to five billion Euros.
Now it seems rather than Kerviel is only a big player that wanted to equal its colleagues, and that, what's more, not at can all be considered as incapable.
In contrast to all the big houses of bank, it recognized on time the crisis of the market of the American hypothèques.
"It is fragile", gave to understand its superior ones that denounced it to the police.
Nevertheless, if one is anxious the deposition of Kerviel retrieved by the French media, of which The World, the transactions of this man produced in end of last year a profit rising to 1.6 billion Euros.
The crisis surpasses the United States
"All that I wanted, it was to earn money for my bank", it asserts in deposition.
The last summer, it succeeded taking advantage of the American crisis to win a half billion Euros.
Indeed, it felt the occasion as early as the year beginning.
Of the news began emerging in February according to which ones the hypothèques say "sub-prime", granted to customers to weak income or well to those that had met in the past difficulties of reimbursement, would have problems.
But this crisis should not influence on the economy body.
Kerviel did not there believe and it well bet.
Thus, in year end, its profits rose to 1.6 billion Euros.
"As soon as I had won my half first billion, I did not know how to announce it", entrusted Kerviel and adds that it has not, well heard, anything kept for himself."
In all questioning, it had to have distorted the reports in order not to to be identified.
It succeeded fooling its superior, although the stock market Eurex began being very interested in its transactions.
Who risks nothing n´a nothing
Was it afraid of to be discovered?
Rather no.
"I considered that the simple one does to have obtained 1.6 billions for the bank was going to satisfy them."
From which comes his will to risk so big?
It did not succeed in his post that progressively.
It had begun working with the General Corporation in 2000 immediately following to have finished its studies to the University of Lyon.
His annual salary revolved around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, it already was assistant of tradeur and, in 2005, it became independent tradeur with an annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
Nevertheless, it knew that it never would win as much as the others.
"As early as my first discussion in 2005, I knew that I well less was considered that the others.
To the look of my university program and of my professional and personal journey", specified to the investigators Kerviel.
Now, shortly after his take office, it wins his big first success.
Thanks to the actions Allianz, it won a half billion Euros while betting on the decrease of this title at the time of the attempts of London.
And the mechanism was released - it wanted more.
As long as you win, one leaves you in peace
"There was as an effect ball of snow", it said to the policemen.
But the superior during the course of all, or rather, they themselves doubted some.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close the eyes."
Now, this is while arises the blow of the beginning of the year.
It loses a billion Euros in a day.
To the mid-january, after during the weekend, it decides to conceal the sum.
Monday, when it arrives to the work, it not more is employed bank.
Some days after, the bank announces that she lost 5 billion Euros because of him.
And how one discovered it?
It became suspicious because of its vacations.
"The past year, I took only 4 days off.
A trader that does not take any vacation is a trader that does not want to leave his book to another", concludes Kerviel.
Czech has the occasion to obtain 365 billions
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed in all nine operational programs with representatives of the European Commission, that can, in the years to come, bring 14 billion Euros (about 365 billion crown Czech) to the Czech Republic.
It is a matter almost of the half of the entirety of the sum that Czech can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Close to 125 billion crown coming from seven operational programs will be intended for the Czech regions.
The Czech businesses will be able to obtain about 100 billion crown in the framework of the program Business and innovation.
The transportation sector will benefit from the biggest one leaves, until 150 billions.
The program Transportations is the operational program the most important one and represents until 22 percent of the financial means than the Rép. Czech can obtain in the framework of these projects.
This money will be at the origin of an increase of the budget of the national Bottom of the infrastructure of the transportations that will manage next year a sum of 90.8 billion crown.
The program Business and innovation, intended for the SMES and to the contractors, must serve to obtain from the financial means to encourage the innovation within the business.
The businesses should obtain from the financial means for the introduction of new technologies, the research in the industry, but equally for the introduction of new methods of more effective management.
So far, the Rép. Czech did left, among the new members, profitable of the funds of THE E.U. the less crowned success.
The Court confirmed the penalty of 20 years of prison for the ex-président of the Nicaragua
The Court of appeals of the Nicaragua confirmed Thursday pains it of 20 years of prison for the former president of the country Arnold Alemán, to which it was condemned in 2003 for a fraud of 100 millions of dollars (close to 1.8 billion crown).
Now, later it was liberated and lived assigned to residence in his hacienda close to the capital of the Nicaragua.
If the former boss of this State centers American, in function between 1997 and 2002, will be or not again encarcéré is not for the moment, according to the agency AP, clear.
According to the president of the Court of appeals Ileana Perisies, all will depend now of the agents of prison, or well they will leave Aleman to finish his penalty at his place, or will well go again in prison.
4 years ago, the Court proved qu´Alemán uniformly moved the money of the government towards accounts of foreign corporations to Panama.
It was a matter of fictitious corporations and the accounts belonged in reality to the members of his family and to its supporters more close.
A part of this money went in the funds qu´Alemán had created in order to finance his election campaign in 2001.
One adopted the budget
This is thus.
The budget étatique was adopted.
Is in what this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget conceived by this government and accepted by the governmental majority without the supports opposition.
The one for the year in course is passed a year ago thanks to the supports on the part Czech socialist - since this is the minister Sobotka that had prepared it and could not allow itself his refusal.
In contrast to the restless debate preceding the vote of the declaration of mistrust to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Room of the representatives adopted without any problem this law that, although the most influential one, is usually neglected.
Here a paradox sort.
What one want it or no, every chapter and every item constitute the beginning and the end of all government.
The budget left constituent of the political one, although concealed behind the strength competition opposing government and opposition.
This last one is more attractive media and this is for that than one grants to him more attention in the media.
The disputes of the politicians interest a lot more l´opinion than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the socialist past governments suffered from three evil that the current budget is not capable of regulate at once:
The first one having left it important granted to the mandate expenses taxed by the law, constituted not only by the retirements, but equally by the social loads, adopted last year by the "coalition" silent grouping together leave them and.
The second one being a loss-making economy, consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle, him, is constituted by the deficit of the public finances, i.e. by the deficit of the cities and towns.
Nevertheless, this is not the deficit of the budget étatique that represents the biggest hazard.
This one is public and comparatively under checks.
The true bomb to retardement, this is the deficit of the cities and towns.
A lot of mayors emitted often, some stun, obligations, in debt démesurément their municipalities, in order to obtain, put to leaves money originating taxes, fiscal rights and credits of bank, of new sources of investment.
In the past years, they succeeded reimbursing these debts by the sale in mass of the actions of the systems of distribution, notably of those of the energy, obtained from the State in the privatization framework.
Today, they no longer dispose of this souce.
If one is held some only to the official facts and vérifiables, one notes that:
Our economy already crosses for a number of years, just as the world remainder, a phase of growth and does not lack itself to blow some.
It was a unique occasion for the successive governments on this part sort out the public finances.
Now, instead of that, they got in debt the State more and more.
Of other countries, put to leaves some exceptions as the Hungary, Albania or Egypt, managed their matters of a manner a lot more reasonable than our republic.
This is a monstrous shame that falls again essentially on the preceding governments.
We are part of the countries that, to the global ladder, less are threatened them by poverty.
We have not therefore any program social massive need that are themselves, exactly the latter years, unfortunately uselessly swelled.
Although one succeeded eliminating a part of the absurd populist expenditures, approved the past year before the elections, if a gap of the limit of age for the retirement, as well as a reformation of the system of the retirements will not have place soon, then all political one will stop existing in this country and whoever will be in power, it will do nothing but to manage.
In éxagérant scarcely, one can say that the in power politicians will become bureaucrats distributing méchaniquement the majority of taxed money between the retirements and the social security benefits.
This is the reason the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it only can suspend the mechanism that does that the ordinary expenses are pushed back by the mandate expenses.
The deficit of 70 foreseen billions for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the preceding governments had not dissipated all the money that they could.
If we do not want really that it happen that the in power political become simple bureaucrats, it is necessary for us to be patient and grant to this governmental fragile coalition, conscious that the State can spend only the equivalent one of what it arrives to remove in taxes and in fiscal rights, the necessary calm to the preparation of new laws of reformation.
There is only the latter that will allow attaining progressively a budget étatique stable.

The banks want to regulate the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European central Bank and the central English banks, Swiss and Canadian decided to fight together the crisis of the financial markets.
More than hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on the markets monetary by the bid intermédiare.
It will be a matter for the banks to sell, by a bid system, the interest rate auquels they are ready to borrow money.
By way of example, the American Fed will send to the bids 40 billion dollars and, of more, it will furnish 24 billions to the European central Banks and Swiss.
This is the first time since the attacks of the 11. September that the central Banks of individual States decided of an action to this collective point, aiming to prevent, indeed to diminish the effects of the financial crisis.
"This gait stretches to regulate the major problems of the economy, to know the lack growing free capitals that the banks could lend", writes in his report to the customers Bernard Baumohl of the corporation of counsel Economic Outlook Group.
"The collective action of the central Banks diminished the probability of a recession to the United States of 65 percent to about 50 percent", adds Baumohl in his report.
The banks already lost 60 billion dollars because of the ready reimbursed nos, especially to the United States.
The analysts await again other losses in billions.
"If the central Banks chose this gait, this is that they must apprehend actually what again can follow", says the economist in boss of the ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It appears that the position is really bad", it adds.
The central Banks fear that, if the banks themselves will have a difficult access to the ready ones, they will lend dearer to their customers.
This would diminish the consumption and dives the American economy in a recession being able to influence on the economical growth of the entire world.
The central Banks did this choice after one did not succeed let the interbank rate lower of London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
Which meant that the banks always feared the mutual loans, despite that the American central Banks, Canadian and English diminished to several returns, during the fall, their interest rate.
"That will have the same effect that a new decrease of the interest rate", says to the agency Reuters Greg Salvaggio of the corporation Tempus Consulting.
Certain analysts do not believe that the gait of the central Banks will contribute not to avert the crisis, since she not rule the principal problem that is the fall of the real estate market to the WORE.
The president Klaus: the debate of the ecologists are unbelievable
The global climatic changes are supposed to harm especially to the countries in the process of development.
The president Václav Klaus is itself again pronounced on the problematic one planetary warming.
The critic cut down itself this time on the international lecture of the united Nations on the climatic changes finishing to Bali.
To Comes, where it presented his book The blue, not green planet, it enunciated that the debate of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, this is not only structures it lecture, constituted by a curious mixture of representatives of governments and of non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but equally the basic difference that there is between the rhetoric accompanying it and the reality.
"The debate there is not structured of the all, it is only a word rocket, substitute of the solutions to the current problems", said Klaus.
The Czech president underlined, at the time of the presentation of his book, that his subject has for him a big importance and this is for that that it is involved himself as much for this cause.
It equally showed his satisfaction of what his book appears also in German translation, since, it said, "I do not meet often that the caricature of my opinions".
Henceforth, the persons interested can read its positions without are distorted.
Klaus recalled that although it be not climatologist, it has nevertheless, in his opinion, enough disposals to compose such a book.
This is in fact an academician able to follow and to appreciate scientific treaties, it has the practice of statistics and it is equally economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate evolves continually, the changes of this one are therefore normal, it does not exist an opinion divided by all the researchers on the planetary warming, the effects of the current changes are not or too important do or too engrave, they do not represent therefore any danger and, at last, the conducted efforts in order to influence the evolution Costly.
So much more than having the experience of a totalitarian system, it considers as unacceptable to impose opinions invérifiées to the others, which it feels as an attained dangerous one to liberty.
In response to the questions of the persons present, it explained to several returns that it was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist environnementalisme that does not take in consideration the relation between the expenses and the profit that they bring".
To Comes, Klaus already had talked about this subject two months ago, to the institute Hayek.

The lawyer of the stricken families Igor Veleba wants to obtain from the hospital of a compensation of 12 millions of crowns more the expense.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and a million for each of the children.
The hospital proposes a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
This is the reason why the lawyer of the hospital Dostál is not absolutely agreed with the suggestion of Veleba.
"We refuse such a claim, this one very very student", said Dostál to the go out of the audience.
"To be in a position to to be done an opinion on the contreproposition, we need the report of expert of which it adverse left ordered the compilation.
We will verify if this one has some explanatory value.

Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the litigation on the subject of the brand Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, this is effectively him that had used for the first time it title King of Valašsko, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former assistant of the actor.
Polívka was not present to the audience of today.
Now, according to his lawyer, the matter probably is not finished and his customer will appeal.
"The litigation concerns the Fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team exploit on the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the process the lawyer of Polívka.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko evoke to everyone exactly this actor and comical.
Harabiš is same opinion.
"There is behind we a work of almost ten years.
Of research of money and of perfect events" it said.
According to him, this is the money that is the litigation cause.
"After the years, they went counts that the project has success and that they can to draw from it profit.
This is them that want to exploit on our work", it added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, this is Polívka that used for the first time it title valašský král (King of Valašsko) in his televised transmission.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned it king in 1993.
Now, to the era, that had not any report with the project to set up a fictitious kingdom.
Some years later, Harabiš came with the idea to publish the passports of the Valašské Království.
Of a humorous action to the origin it took out a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, corporation Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and his signature are quoted in the passport and it even proposed to the tenured ones of the balances on the price of the visit of his farm and of its spectacles of theater.
Who will itself sit on it holds court?
Today, the judge equally mentioned that Harabiš did nothing but to use the nude idea, published by Polívka in the transmission to commercial ends.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has helped certainemement the project Valašské království," said the judge.
She added nevertheless that the project soul was constituted by Harabiš and his team that devoted itself to the project in an excessive way.
The collaboration between the parties today enemies continued up to 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka an official coronation to Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began accumulating itself between Polívka has Harabiš, that peaked with deposition "king Boleslav 1st elected for always".
The role leader in the kingdom was next, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka carried complaint against Harabiš and his corporation, asks that the court today rejected.
What could pull to the clear one the matter is envisaged tournament for holds court it and a half of the princess.
It would have go out a new king.
It did not want again to betray the details and the date.
"We do not want to go quickly in job.
That would be quelquechose as the parade of the kings to Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a certain time.
Same mister Polívka well evidently can register itself", added Harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1,6 VTi: prejudice diparition
To true to say, I never was a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rumble qualities were nothing of extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, driving and equally the one of the manufacture can, to several consideration, to be qualified of inferior one to the average.
Now, currently there is on the market his successor the Peugeot 207 that, she, is clearly better.
So much more than the named combi SW goes again a step more far, it does not remain me more than to more better to reflect.
When I tested the classical hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I complained for example space for the head on the seats of behind.
While there finished the complaints because the body combi means that even the big devils will be, in this respect, comfortable.
Will see quickly does
I will evoke very quickly the interior for not too to repeat me.
It is a matter of an almost successful design, my only remark concerning the central tunel that appears me poor.
There, I would have liked a design a little more resourceful, being given that the car seems so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the era where one could complain about seats or of too short files is past.
The lateral guidage equally clearly improved in comparison with the model 206.
As for the space, the increase of the dimensions of the body is sensitive there also.
The combi see disappeared equally lacks it place above the already mentioned head.
A trunk in the trunk
The most important one on this vehicle, this is therefore his soutte to luggage.
I must evaluate this one as very well accessible (equally thanks to the ice pivoting rear) and of a rather easy stowage.
The blind spaces are provided with rubber bands of stop that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not cluttering and can be spread all while being able to hold objects asez heavy.
But let us stop we to the volume.
This one does, according to the pictures, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is in comparison with the competition a rather average figure.
Put to leaves the Škoda Fabia Combi, vehicle more sold of this category in Czech.
If one compares the 207 SW with the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, one notes that the Peugeot remains very noticeably behind, the difference being of 52 liters.
When it is a matter to leave on vacation abroad or well to load a go-cart, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to put emphasis on the advantages, I would mention the under of cash register remaining after the overthrow of the files of the rear seats perfectly right, or well a market foot very low.
120 divided up horses on four cylinders
The automobile that we have tested was equipped of a motor Otto of four cylinders with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And to true to say, is thereto that should resemble a 1.6 pulls that leg a family hatchback.
It is silent, consumes little and, especially, it pushes well.
If I compare it with the equivalent one produces by Škoda that gives often the impression to have a muffler blocked by a serpillère, then I do not can to be some that enthusiast.
Let us traverse the tariffs
The vehicle price is not reasonable by all.
Nevertheless, one must be aware that one has tested an enough car well equipped, with an interior spacieux and a very good motor.
The basic price of a vehicle with a motor Otto 1.4 liters rising to 329 900 is again passable.
The vehicle that we have tested costs from 410 900 what already is enough.
The equipment Premium, equally tested, increases the price of 80 000.
Now, we disposed what's more airbags head, of an automatic air-conditioning, of automatic essuis-glace, of an automatic order of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900.
This is a lot, but try to add to the price of the Fabia the additional equipment and you will obtain a very similar figure.
It does not remain therefore more than to choose the brand.
The integration of the Slovak students in the schools britaniques carries itself poorly
The number of native children of the countries of the eastern Europe in the schools britaniques goes growing, which provokes with the worry abodes on the subject of the evolution of the local education.
The integration of the Europeans of the east bumps itself, for the moment, to an obstacle series.
The schools britaniques note even cases where of the conflicts between immigrated and descending of the inhabitants of origin transform themselves in violence.
The case of the Kent of the north, where begin stressing itself the conflicts opposing remaining and immigrated of Slovak origin illustrates well the problem of the integration of the native children of eastern Europe.
The disputes, argues it and the scuffles between the students transposed themselves in the relations between the parents.
The position went so far that the police stopped to Chatham a Slovak woman that hit with an iron bar a student agé of ten years.
The guilty one defends itself while asserting that the boy had insulted it by rasistes.
The police had equally to intervene after the attack against a Slovak immigrant conducted by two adolescent ones.
The girls had prétendument address to this man of the racist remarks and had thrown to him rocks.
"When one returned to the house, a young one climbed on the stop of bus and began spitting us over.
When I said for him to stop, it replied by apples and pears and then it discovered its buttocks", described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are formulated by the two parties.
The one of the abodes went until to qualify the conflicts with the fight immigrants for the survival.
The evoked cases higher testify than the atmosphere in the schools britaniques between the inhabitants of origin and the immigrants begins being stretched.
70 thousand come Slovaks to find work are recorded in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students frequent the schools britaniques.
Gauged, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean ones
For the visitors, this is really an island of liberty.
All that you await of your vacations can realize themselves if you done a good choice.
Gilded and white beaches as the snow, high waves or then a sea calms as a pond.
Palms and the inclusive all with waiters offering you on the beach a pizza, ice or several cocktails intoxicating.
The kitesurfing, the golf and roulette.
On the islands of the sea of the Caraîbes, you will not rediscover this list only in his entirety, but enriched.
Now, there is only a single island on which will find you again a lot more and this is Gauged, the biggest and the most beautiful island of the Big West Indies.
To the time of the Spaniards, Gauged had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Columbus qualified it as the most beautiful place than the human eye never saw.
The Havana became the deposit and the place of transbordement of the treasures that the Spaniards had flown and that they transported in Europe.
Next came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was erected to the all beginning of the years 20'.
This is Lucky Luciano, the one of the bosses of the American mafia, that had it built, since all which was a crime to the WORE (especially under the prohibition) was admitted and supported to Gauged: the drug, the chance games, prostitution.
Among its customers, there was, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
To the Havana, buildings in height pushed and cars, belonging to the symbols worships of the years 50' last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property to San Francisco of Paula, close to the Havana, and, to Cojímar, it had his yacht.
The stars of the showbusiness and politicians of entire America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And today then?
You can leave yourself your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of the Havana.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, one will mix you the cocktail of your choice.
And these cars worships always circulate to the Havana, since the jigoulis and the formerly imported fiats already have since a long time, in a so salty and humid climate, rotted.
Although the Havana, especially it left the oldest one, be decrepit noticeably, nullepart elsewhere in the vicinity it has not as much colonial splendid monuments that there are some precisely over there.
Of other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Being given that tourism brings money if necessary, his development has the green light.
During the last fifteen years, again hotels pushed not only to the Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of the province Holguín, and also on the small islands such as Cayo Coconut, Cayo Guillermo and of others.
Gauged proposes again a fantasy that is unique to the world and that will be appreciated especially by the amateurs of small trains.
The cane had returned since the extensive plants in sweets on a way narrow by of small trains to vapor and to motor.
Their rolling equipment was not renewed during tens of years and this is as well as one there can see in market of the small locomotives of which the contemporary ones are not elsewhere only in museums.
Towards where to direct its steps?
The majority of the visitors does not lack the places the more known.
It there has not therefore need of some to write long on Varadero or well on the Havana.
Otherwise to recall that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one that likes this writer should not spoil the visit.
The valley of the island west constitutes the one of the corners more picturesque of Gauged.
A vegetation exhubérante there pushes on a ground limestone.
Mogotes, balls limestone and boulders climb in candle of the bottom of the valley, and, fertile earth having taken itself in their intestines, even its rotten rocks are covered with a vegetable very dense rug.
The valley is the place where one probably cultivates tobacco cuban of the better quality.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit the one of the factories of cigars of the Havana.
Someone will find maybe equally interesting that this is there that to turned summer the Chilean episode of Officer Zeman.
Trinidad
Old founded city little time after the Spaniards colonized the island.
This is walked it the commerce of the slaves and the one of Sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth is itself incarnate in beauty and the character city window of this city of reduced size.
Koloniální francouzskými osadníky, itself za staletí.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the mountainous massive Escambray, is a place to such not at all out-of-the-way that again in the years 50' last century, there was not road that would link up this region with the country remainder.
This isolation allowed for him to remain aside.
One constructed nothing, and this is the reason why one demolished nothing not more, each was satisfied to have a roof above the head.
If one has, to Trinidad, more time that an afternoon, then it is worth the penalty to be going to see equally places interessants in the vicinity, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the valley of Sweets.
Then, evenings, it is custom to go to Put it Música that animates itself after it sunset and where the music does not become muffled that to the small morning.
Baracoa
Some designate this situated village to the extreme one Is of Gauged as the most beautiful one of the island.
This opinion certainly is already influenced by the way that there takes.
The two roads that there take since Guantánamo must cross high and injured mountains and cross a landscape almost without mark human activity.
UNESCO registered the reef Is of Gauged, thanks to his intact landscape, on the list of the world-wide heritage.
One there makes the better chocolate, to the church, there is the cross of Christophe Columbus (in reality, she saw the light of day almost hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and since the hill where is held the former chateau-fort and the current hotel El Castillo, one sees several mountains table, of which the most famous one is El Yunque.
On the subject of coffee, rum, cigars, of the mountainous massive Sierra Maestra, Bay of the truies and island Isla of Pinos, of cabaret Tropicana, sanctuary of the holy patrone of Gauged Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, on the subject of all that one could fill.
Only, as one says exactly, it is more better to see once.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, assert the Americans
The lack of soldiers and of necessary equipment influences, according to the United States, on mission sequence in Afghanistan.

The number of violent actions increased of 27 percent in comparison with the past year, until 60 percent in the province Helmand, situated to the country south.
The countries of NATO have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, of which close to a quarter in the party south.
Now, according to the United States, the allies attained their absolute limit and in the organization and in the troop equipment.
Concretely, they ask other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the entrainement of the Afghan troops.
"We will have to reflect seriously on the concrete objectives for the period to come, just like on the manners how to attain them", said Gates.
The general secretary of NATO Jaap of Hoop held today similar.
"I am not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have almost ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment of which we would need, and that is not enough", said Hoop to the agency Reuters at the end of the talks with the Japanese government to Tokyo that lasted three days.
Who is passive
The latter months reign equally between the implied countries of the conflicts concerning the question if all the allies do effectively in Afghanistan all their possible one.
For example Germany was criticized for his passivity.
"The Germans have in Afghanistan a comparatively numerous representation.
But they are engaged in zones where the violence is minimal, the fight requirements of which they are subject are not therefore as severe as the one in the parties South and Is country where we operate", said Gates.
The tabloid britanique Sun qualified this week the German soldiers of lazy one.
"The Afghan discovered lazybones: the Germans play, while the ours fight", wrote Sun in a completed document by photos of German soldiers playing held table.
The German newspaper Bild is passed to the counter-attack while publishing the photo of a troop britanique at the time of a game of rugby in the party south of the Afghanistan.

The British was accused to have left students of 6 to 7 years to give the name of Mohammed to a bear some becomes fluffy while all representation of the prophet of the Islam is illicit.
She was liable of a penalty of blows of whip.
This British teacher of 54 years in function to the Unity High School of Khartoum to the Soudan, was stopped Sunday at her place and charged of attain to the Islam and of insurrection, by virtue of the item 125 of the Sudanese penal code, following several complaints of parents of students auprés of the Ministry of the Sudanese education.
The history climbs back up in fact in the month of September, when this teaching asks its students, agés of 6/7 years, to choose a name for the bear some becomes fluffy of the class.
"Eight names go out of the mouth of the children, of which Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", relates the director of the school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children on 23 have chooses Mohamed as first to name preferred.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Moslem prophet, but especially a first one to name very common to the Soudan.
The children next realized a book for the class with the bear photo followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear him meme did not carry any label with this name, but the problem simply the one of the representation of the considered prophet as an insult to the Islam.
The one of the Moslem colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, teaching in the same school to the Soudan, specified that it knew it well and that she never would have done although this be that can be insulting towards a religious faith, "I regret just that she asked the children to vote for a name", it is not a matter according to him that of an "innocent error".
Opinion divided by many students of the teacher that describe it as "very attentive towards its students" and "that never speaks religion in class".
Recall that first to name it Mohamed is equally the second first to name the most given one in Great Britain, it writes himself English of 14 different manners.
This first one to name often chooses by the Moslem families is a manner to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But which are the rules concerning the usage of this first one to name?
Can one for example to give it to a toy?
It is a matter of course of a question of interpretation.

Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have been more than seven necessary hours of work in the space to the astronaut Scott Parazynski and to its friends of crew of the international space Station (ISS) to carry out the spectacular repair of a solar torn panel, essential to the pursuit of the scientific activities of the station.
An exit risked that accumulated the records owing to his length, of his remoteness of habitable units, rapidity with which she was imagined, tools "tinkered with" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared Tuesday while the astronauts had offloaded the shuttle Discovery modulates it Harmony, a big cylindrical piece in charge of welcoming soon the European scientific laboratories and Japanese (to see framed).
This unit is a sort of quay of landing for units laboratories.
But it is necessary to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second one try the crew was therefore to move an unit of production of electricity by solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it to posts on his final position.
After moving it, the crew started the redeployment of the solar panels of the unit that have a breadth of 76 meters.
And this is there that the one of the panels, that unfold themselves as accordions, was damaged on near of a meter by a cable that jammed itself.
The deployment was stopped in order not to damage more the panel.
The astronauts, that had to the origin to carry out one go out of check of the shuttle Discovery, then next to be going to repair another solar panel of which the rotation system was defective, saw themselves constrained to devote itself to the damaged panel.
And this is Scott Parazynski that was chosen to be going to be ahead at the end of the 30 meters of length of the arm télécommandé of the added shuttle to the one of the station to carry out the repair.
This is the one of the better ones "spacewalker" (space walker) Nasa.
Bigger, more resistant, more very more skillful, it has the very developed trunk and of long arms.
To 46 years, this formation doctor has therefore loaded summer of "to operate" the solar panel "injured".
After precisely to have inspected damages, it divided the faulty cable and installed sorts of "hitch" on the damaged zone.
It was helped by a second one "spacewalker" remained close to the his and, interior, by the other astronauts of which Peggy Whitson, the crew order.
The tool that it used, a minicanne of enveloped hockey of insulating one to avoid the electrocution on the solar panels producing several hundreds of volts, was conceived and "tinkered with" by the astronauts on board of the station.
Once the finished operation, Scott Parazynski awaited that the panel completely is deployed before doing the inventory of its tools and to regain the station interior.

The choice of the status quo
There will be not suspense, Sunday, to the go out of the ballot boxes: the Russians massively will choose for the party of president Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, indeed to authoritarianism, after a very locked country.
To three days of the legislative elections, the Russian president Vladimir Putin addresses today to the voters a televised message on the public chains, already recorded but of which it contained is kept secret.
It does it as head of list of united Russia, the pro party kremlin of which the victory announces itself crushing.
Yesterday, the president not in anything showed while receiving the foreign ambassadors, being satisfied book a new load against the accused West of interference - his predilection theme during the country.
"We know the price of a true democracy and wish honest elections, the most transparent and the most open, elections without tears", it added.

"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus"

- That will succeed Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday dates back to it the first turn of the presidential one, March 2 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make itself known.
Elu in 2000 and reelected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot covet a third consecutive mandate.
Now no successor emerges.
- Which role will play Putin after March?
Prime Minister?
Would boss of the parliamentary majority and of the all powerful party Russia united that choose the government and the president?
Although it be some, to the legislatures as to the presidential one, the strength going out will prevail.
This is a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny", estimates the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, of the university of State of Holy pétersbourg, climb back up more far: the civil corporation took delay in this christianized country five centuries after Europe; the fine community spirit delayed the individualism formation.
After the liberal reformations of the years 90, "Putin renewed with the model of a paternalistic State, perfectly accepted by the population so much more than this new paternalism was not followed by the terror, but by a certain economical ease", estimates Married Lipman, Foundation Carnegie.
Today the Russians "renounce of own free will to the personal responsibility" of which they briefly had shown after the explosion of USSR.
"Has what good to reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all the put to bed social, including the matter world.
And the administrative elite hears to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (on 85 bosses of Russian regions) direct the local lists of united Russia.
The new imported liberties of West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the years 90.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of what the Russians will not vote not more for the extremist ones.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, professor of 54 years: "Has what good to reflect?
Those that are in power are not too bad, why to change them?"

The builders also will be able to benefit from this rally, if they themselves there put.
"ACS for several months recovers positions and we hope that the other builders as Ferrovial and FCC suiveront it same way", explains the expert.
The cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last party of the due year to the sale increase in the season of sales of Christmas.
Of another side, the expert believes that the businesses technologicals will do it also very well, although in this case there is not a lot of representations on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the seven last years, only during two occasions the month of December was a bearish month.
The authentic rally of end of year took place in 2003, exercise during which them stock market walked went out of the crisis provoked by the percement of the bubble technological.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of dicembre recorded an increase of 6.68%.

A unique aspect tarnished his joy: 'What does me poorly this is not the Fact that more increased us but than we less lowered', it asserted.

According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is of the to the Fact that 'we talk about two similar businesses.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, on the same market, to which price and how we profit from it in terms of audience '.
Telecinco announced last week that it foresees to become this year the first chain of television to surpass the 1,000 millions of crude advertising income, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the delegated counselor of Telecinco and of Publiespaña, the affiliate that manages group advertising.

Vasile assures that, although it be early to take a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.

This year, I hope that we will be able to render happy our shareholders, to those to that already gave us titles with the 33% of Endemol '.

As indicated it yesterday the Chain SER to the lawyer of the representative 'popular party' Moral Juan, one stopped it while going out of the residence of Morals with important documentation in his posséssion relating to weaves it.
Of more, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the presumed encaissement of commissions of Morals in exchange for to facilitate the signature of an urban agreement with a business builder of the galice to requalify 200 hectares of land.

Bono accepts at the head of the candidacy on the part Spanish socialist for Tolède and to preside the Congress themselves they win the elections
The ex-ministre of the Defense José Bono accepted the offer of the president of the Government and general secretary of the socialists, José Shines Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list on the part Spanish socialist for Tolède for the next general elections and be president of the Congress if the socialists will win the general elections.
Thus the secretary of organization on the part Spanish socialist, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it for a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon to the federal seat on this part with Zapatero.
The boss of the Executive justified the offer done to the ex-ministre because "it is important to count on the better ones" in political life and Bono "is among the better ones".
Of more, it underlined that "yes it seems" that the politician of The Sleeve will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside the Congress if the socialists will win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manual Marín as president of the Congress, that the latter rendered public November 15 last his decision of not to present itself to the prochainess elections general and to abandon his political career to devote itself to the fight against the climatic change in the university framework.
The ex-ministre recognized that the president of the Government did not stop insisting for that it comes back to the political avant-garde since that it abandoned it two years ago.
Of more, it pointed out that, even if the citizens already know that the economical vice president if the Spanish socialist party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one that will preside the Congress, in a "transparency act".
If it attains the post, Bono hopes to transform the Room in "a house of the respect and not of the insult or cry" and do that "she resembles more and more to the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems miserably that the local unique one of Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the president of the Government to the Senate in certain occasions has éte interrupted 26 times".
Same manner, it had words of praise for his current president, Manual Marín and "his knowledge to do" and it did not want to do as if it already occupied his post in order not to to fall, as it pointed out it, in what its opponents could consider as "a domination".
A climatic publicity
Being given that the movement against the climatic change subjects to a persecution without mercy just as well the skeptical ones of its predictions as those that gives priority to other political and social battles, it must show an iron coherence.
This is so much more the case for a movement leader that is president of the Government as Zapatero and that believes than this fight is more important than the one of the Islamist terrorism and that proposes itself even to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach the obliges to explain why the action, or the inaction, of his Government contributed in a decisive way to what Spain be at the head of the European Union in the non-éxecution of the Kyoto protocol.
Who are the persons in charge of the non-éxecution, in which sectors she is produced themselves and why his Government, the one of the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
Of more, it clearly must explain to the which Spaniards are the measures that it will take to brake the climatic change.
Which businesses will be affected, which habits of the citizens will have to be changed, which individual energetic economies and collective will be obliged us to do, which economical consequences that it will provoke.
That is to say, that will sacrifice itself and that will pay to save the planet.
But it had not and there will be not any explanations.
Precisely because it is a matter to sacrifice itself and to pay.
The measures against the climatic change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of the businesses and individuals.
Until the hundredth one gasoline suggested by the Spanish socialist party seemed him so dangerous electoralmente to Zapatero that it hurried himself to deny it.
That is to say that it is a matter to save the planet with nothing, only with publicity, with slogans empty of all real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, again posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this so useful mister for the election campaigns that does not speak, that does not denounce and that does not demand, embellishes the meetings and inspires the kindness.
Provided that that itself limit only to be a party contracting purely potential and that does not claim to what we moved ourselves in bicycle or we refreshed ourselves with the fan.

The prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del big Shot for eight years follows implacably the criminals of war of the Balkans since the public ministry of the Penal Court for the former Yugoslavia, that is located to The Hague.

Which assurance does it suit me?
The car insurance, that covers the driver facing of sinister eventual ones, implies an important expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as the age, the sex, the seniority of the driver's license, the civil state, the vehicle type to assure or the usage that one indeed, among others.
To have a car is the principal one.
There are that, escoger el seguro of automóvil adecuado are incluso más difícil that elegir el modelo of vehículo.
And this is that, choose the adequate car insurance, is even more difficult than to choose the vehicle model.
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the underwriter.
This compromise materializes itself by an insurance policy, that establishes that the company receives the premium value granted and in exchange she becomes responsible of the obligation to pay the compensation in case of sinister.
The premium is the assurance price, that establishes itself while taking various factors into account, such as the age, the sex, the seniority of the driver's license, the civil state, the vehicle type to assure or the usageque one indeed, among others.
The insurance companies establish their prices according to statistics, so that more the probability to undergo an accident student, more quotes it to pour student.
This is for this reason that the persons of more than 25 years and the women must pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these persones have a rate of sinister weaker one of the to their prudence.
Same manner, while using the census, the companies concluded that the married persons tend less than accidents that the unmarried drivers.
The usage that one does the vehicle will influence on the frequency, and therefore on the probability to have an accident.
While increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
They are numerous the variables that the underwriters hold in account at to establish the premium price.
This is for that, that the driver must well study the position to choose the car insurance that adapts itself the better to his profile.
We will expose here the variables more significant at to choose the one or the typical other of assurance, for that this one, what's more to adapt itself to the characteristics of the underwriter, offers him a reasonable price.
The young ones of less than 25 years must do facing various inconveniences at to pass a contract with an assurance to an accessible price, as can be it the weak experience in driving and the seniority of the driver's license.
Although the ideal for to be well assured be an assurance to all risk, of other more economical options exist.
The drivers more provident can choose for an assurance all risk with frankness, so that they obtain the covers of an assurance to all risk but to a more accessible price.
This convention form implies that the customer pays a part of the amount of the sinister one.
"The party of the amount of the sinister one that the customer towards will be established according to the premium value, that more student more climbing it will be weak", specifies Shines Noguera, the person in charge in Spain of First Europa, mediator of online insurances.
Another option is the assurance to widened third, so that the customer assures the protection to do facing provoked damages to third, but by for those caused on his own car.
Of more, it would be covered against the flight, the fires and the vehicle loss.
A counsel.
If you are minor of 25 years try to be prudent and to avoid the sinister as much as possible, since that pass on itself on bonus, being able to reduce the assurance price in the future.
A bonus is a reduction of the basic tariff that possesses the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase of the basic tariff.
"Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and profit of this one.
If the company had a good year she will be able to allow herself to increase bonuses ", clarifyes Noguera.
Beyond the 25 years that becomes easier for the drivers at to pass a contract with an assurance, since the rate of sinister ones is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
This is for this reason that it is preferable to choose an assurance all risk with frankness.
"Normally the young ones cannot take experience advantage to the previous one obtained after an accident", assures the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the accident majority produce themselves during the second year of driving, once passed the 'fear of the novice'.
Nevertheless, if the customer is gotten married but has not again children it is preferable that it negotiates an assurance to all risk, momento that his financial situation allows it for him.
The marriages with children are considered by the underwriters as being the persons with the rate of sinister the weakest, because the increases will be weaker.
In this case the better assurance would be an assurance to all risk with frankness (being able to be of 300 Euros), or an assurance to widened third from the third year of life of the vehicle when the assured has access to a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed driving and they have a bigger purchasing power to allow itself the luxury to assume a more important quantity of franknesses", judges Shines Noguera.
For the retired an assurance to all risk with frankness is preferable (while being this one of 150 Euros), or an asurance to widened third when the underwriter has access to a high level of bonus.
It is necessary to say that the car insurance is something important, not only because she covers the driver facing of sinister eventual ones, but also because she represents an important expenditure, this is for that that it is basic student properly the assurance that suits us the more according to our personal position.
The Celtic will look for to win a point to Milan to arrive to the eighth of final one
The Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow measure themselves next Tuesday to San Siro to the point research that lacks for them to attain their respective objectives in the closing of the league of the Champions, since it serves to the Italians to be first and to the Scotsmen to classify itself.
The Italians total ten points and they already qualified themselves during the fifth day thanks to a game no one to the Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it has again need of another not at all to assure itself that the Shakhtar Donetsk, that some has six, and that receives Benfica that some has four, does not pass to him in front of.
These two games of the Group D will play themselves a week before the sixth day finishes, since the Milan AC must dispute the semifinales of the World Cup of the Clubs to Japan the 13 of this month to the research of a place for the final one of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the game no one to the stadium Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the result the more awaited, although the two teams will try go out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at their place and the Celtic Glasgow knows that in winning there would remain first and would assure itself a better crossroads in the eighth of final one.
A defeat of the team of Gordon Strachan could be sufficient to classify itself if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but she will not be able computer only on that since with nine points the games comes back to the Ukrainian ones, that lost last week to Glasgow (2-1), but that won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese one will try to poison the evening to the Scots, that have good hope to classify itself for the eighth of final one for the second time to the Champions League, after beating during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the prolongations (1-0).
While awaiting the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would return only to the Shakhtar, if the Celtic would lose, to classify itself for the eighth of final one to be able to continue the league of the champions of the UEFA.
And this is that the Benfica, although it be last and without possibilities to follow the European competition, could attain the third place with a victory.

The sportsman was located in the public that filled the GM Places, even if Victoria had forbidden it for him some days before.
Before the spectacle beginning, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British footballer "did not see our suits therefore I am nervous for I do not know what it will think about the spectacle".
'Sporty Spice' that left the group in 1998 "because of the differences between we" and that provoked the group dissolution two years after, equally expressed his nervousness during a discussion with the press, two hours before the beginning of the spectacle.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that the people feeling changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I am satisfies to have taken a decision" said Chisholm on the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed as with the time, "the things arranged themselves and that we ourselves apprecions a lot".
But a lot of things changed since that the Spice Girl exposed themselves for the last time in 1998.
To begin, according to the television CTV, the group arrived to Vancouver in a special airplane of Virgin Airlines.
To their arrival to the airport, an army of baby sitter awaited them.

To Madrid they will expose themselves December 23.
The new matter of gas between Russia and the Ukraine throws the alarms.
A dispute on the gas price ferments between the Ukraine and Russia, increasing thus, the repercussion risks on the fuel exportations towards Europe.
Most of the exportations of Russian gas towards the European Union (E.U.) are transported by gas pipelines, and every drives scrupoulously is overseen.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the fuel cost, she will increase the taxes of freezes to Russia.
The last year, an altercation between the two, had caused a supply decrease towards the countries of THE E.U.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow arises after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, corporation of monopoly of property of Russia furnishing the gas, tried in vain, to find an agreement on the Russian gas cost furnished to the Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom declared that it would increase as foreseen, its prices to the Ukraine seen that it accepted paying for 2008, until 50% of more for the gas supply originating neighbor Turkmenistan.
The analysts declared that that would behave for the Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the costs of the importations originating Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which passes through most of the gas," announced the Ukrainian minister of the Economy, Anatoly Kinkh to the agency of press Reuters.
"The fluctuations of the costs of the gas doubtless would be linked to our discussions about the taxes of freezes (towards western Europe) through the Ukraine"
The big last altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006, the interruption of the supplies of Gazprom intend for the Ukraine.
That induced the exportation fall towards western Europe, increasing by consequence the prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the supplies of the European Union.
Russia possesses the biggest stocks of gas, even if the most of them are again under developed.
By consequence, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas originating Turkmenistan and of other nations of the former Soviet union in central Asia.

The ministry of Scottish health must improve the checks to carry out on its community first rate employees to verify themselves they have of the preceding penal one, declared the check committee.
The warning of the General Réviseur, Robert Black, is arisen after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was implied in the attack to the airport of Glasgow of June.
Mr. Black has in addition, expressed his preoccupation on the Fact that the ministry of Scottish health does not possess any data specifies on the number of overseas persons that it employs.
His report anyway put in other relief check decisive, correctly carried out on a sample of employees of five sanitary authorities.
The general réviseur did the checks on the community first rate personnel after the attack of the airport of Glasgow.

It has declares "the report suggests that the checks meadow jobs carried out currently, work well in the Scottish sanitary system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
Scottish sanitary authorities declared employing 1161 overseas persons, constituted for most of doctors and nurses.
But the general réviseur underlined that these figures certainly must be reviewed to the increase, in left because of the problems relating to the identification of the members of the personnel endow with contract to indeterminate length, that could choose or no, to remain in our country.
The investigation showed that the current procedures of checks of sanitary authorities to Ayrshire and ARAN, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are completely adequate.
These checks are carried out on passport, allowed work and qualifications.
The Scottish Government revises in this moment his political and his system of checks meadow job for the members of the personnel besides ocean of the sanitary service..
The secretary to Health Nicola Sturgeon declared: "I was enthusiast to realize this work following the terrorist attack to the airport of Glasgow."
She added that the Scottish Government allied to the sanitary committees would consider with care enunciated warnings in the report that should be published next month, and would be involved themselves to guarantee a better execution of the checks meadow job updated recently, and valid for all the employees, including the overseas persons.

The saudi Arabia blocks 208 plots terrifying
The saudi Arabia yesterday revealed to have stopped 208 militant implied ones in organizing cells hatching an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks against the ecclesiastical and the armed forces.
The television of state of the biggest world-wide exporteur of oil, declared that one of the cells of smugglers of missiles.
Getting along them Al Qaeda presented a country against the allied monarchy to the United States since 2003, after the invasion of the Iraq.
A cell composed from eight militant ones, directed by a foreign resident planned an attack against an oil site in the Eastern Province, declared the newspaper TV.
The saudi Arabia quickly constituted a group of 35,000 military officers to protect the sites, after a failed attack of Al Qaeda in 2006, against the biggest oil site to Abqaiq.
The newspaper quoting a declaration of the minister of the interior, declared that 18 of the stopped persons belong to a cell directed by an "expert of launch of missiles" that seeps in in the country.
One says that the campaigning planned the against band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 persons among the prisoners would seem to have plotted the assassination of ecclesiastical ones and of armed forces.
The government prayed the ecclesiastical ones to do more against the Saudi ones directed in Iraq, to join the campaigning Al Qaeda fighter against the Allied Forces and against the government shiite Moslem allied to the United States, considered as heretic according to the line lasts Saudi Sunny.
The campaigning Al Qaeda think that in Saudi Arabia, a lot of ecclesiastical collaborated with the authorities to support politics of the royal family that dominates the government.
The campaigning, encouraged by the launched calls against the pro Saudi government west, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted residential foreign zones, buildings of the government and sites of supply of energy.
Of important efforts were carried out by the armed forces at the time of these five... last months" declared the door word of the minister of the interior to the state television.

The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
The scientists yesterday declared that Venus certainly was a pleasant planet to live.
The data coming from the European vessel in orbit showed that the planet is certainly twice as as small the Earth, in contrast to what one thought beforehand.
Venus is the planet the more close to the Earth.
These two worlds are practically even cuts, with similar orbits, although Venus be closer of the Sun.
The scientists believe now that it there billion years, Venus could have had similar conditions to the one of the Earth, and even could have been habitable.
But the effect squeezes had to the carbon dioxyde, the atmospheric erosion due to the solar radiations allied to a slower rotation drove Venus about all another kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived water, is ravaged by hurricanes and storms of flashes and has a temperature surface rather hot for there to melt the lead.
The discoveries of Comings Express, the probe of the European Spatial Agency, that studied the planet during a year, offers a sad vision of the potential future of the due Earth to the disastrous changes of the climate.
The professor of the department of physics of the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the mission of the Comings Express, declared: "We begin understanding the reason the climate of Venus is so different of the one of the Earth, although the planets in they even be practically similar.
"Our new data allow us to establish a scenario according to which there are billion years, Venus originally would have been the same as the Earth, can be even with a living space."
Enriched uranium confined by the police.
A kilo of radioactive equipment, apparently uranium, was confined by the czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A policeman declared that three persons were stopped and that equipment currently is analyzed.

Again open to all
Mitt Romney declared not to be at the height as candidate to the presidency, to reply to the questions of a fellow of snow.
Despite that, the republican candidates to the presidency finally accepted participating in the debate of You Tube, during which many ordinary voters having recorded their questions, the subject to the candidates.
Wednesday evening November 28, none of the put questions not as ridiculous as the one coming from another debates You Tube, when a fellow of snow asked the democrats their position in comparison with the planet warming.
But this time, the questions and the responses a lot reflected the conditions of the republican party, candidate to the next elections.
One knows oneself not on which criteria, the producers of CNN, that sponsored the debate, chose the pop videos of You Tube to show to the inhaling candidates.
But the half first hour of the debate, the longest one approaching of a single theme, focused itself on the immigration.
The subject is one of the subjects the forts for the Republicans.
CNN asked certain voters to telephone when they would hear things pleasing: The governed one raised increases of approval when the candidates expressed themselves in a manner crude.
The exchange more hard and the longest one of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the National Front, and Mr. Romney that is in head of the important early elections of the Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to put in relief the Fact that it was accommodating about the clandestine immigration at the time of his mandate of mayor of New York.
It attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of the Massachusetts, to employ clandestine immigrants at his place.
The two fighters became particularly ferocious when one asked for them themselves they would be ready to promote an "amnésia" (offering to the clandestine an uniform statute and the possibility to become citizen).
Candidates minors as Duncan Hunter, a Californian delegate, and Tom Tancredo, a delegate of the Colorado, succeeded deepening this subject.
None of them has the possibility to be elected, but both of them remainders in the race, thanks to the Fact that they began fighting the immigration before and in a manner more incisive than the others.
In a manner general, the candidates, at least concerning the immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and tolerance zero for the clandestine immigrants.
This subject, allied to the given rise to worries in particular by the toxic toy matter made in China, or many other fears towards the external world, favor the Republicans to forget, or to minimize the divisions between the libertarians and the conservative Catholics.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when subject others were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why it beforehand had supported the country for the weapon check.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated to know if to put water in the nose should be considered as a torture.
One of the participants asked if the candidates believed in his entirety, to the content of the Bible.
That drove Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it is not on to believe the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another intervening asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
One did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in polishes position in Iowa at the time of a recent election, thanks to his Christian conservatism of long date - to declare that the death penalty is painful although necessary.
When one insisted to know if Jesus would have been in favor, it began laughing and declared that Jesus is too chic to present itself to the elections.
The human race unusually remains opened to all.
The ascent of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa coincides with the phenomenal recent subsidy research conducted by the libertarian Ron Paul, and the sifflements at the time of the debate of Wednesday.
These two there are emerged from the void, thanks to the Fact that the two protected on the part do not arrive to come to an agreement to decide that is the candidate more known and more traditionalist.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and in a manner convincing thanks to a success message on the American magnitude comparing thus the leaders.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from being clear.
The pains of the Labor ones
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sink; even if it resigned, the position would not change.
Seen the tendency of the British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No sold decorations, or of bills of Parisian hotel of politicians, no finger of conjugal first rate foot sucked.
But here that a revelation testifies that a rich businessman would have masked for four years, under of false names, its contributions to the current Labor, equivalent Party to more of £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle of which Gordon Brown some would well have happened.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister did walks rear in his election project, insulting stupidly British intelligence proclaiming that the opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that it hoped on the contrary, offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant liberal leader democrat, declared that the terrifying Mr. Brown transformed itself Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The buyback of Rock Northern, a bank in difficulty by the ace, showed a rift of the directives and a mediocre judgement in case of urgency.
The inadequate suggestions in favor of the change of the code of the taxes provoked a coalition of the industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 millions of personal data from tax authorities, revealed an unbelievable one blunders administrative.
A trio of generals to the retirement launched a revolt among the Lords, Protestant against the reductions of the military expenditures: they proclaimed that to be defense minister is for them, an on time partial job.
At the present time, donation suspicion squint from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the general secretary of the Labor ones (and his former boss of vigilance) did that they had to resign.
Nothing of that means that Mr. Brown directs itself inevitably towards the exit.
Nevertheless the governments can arrive to a point where it would be impossible to govern.
The people do not like the politicians, and have not confidence in them, but leave usually their doubt quotation during that a new government arrives in power.
It seems evident that a Prime Minister cannot improve the things, or even to govern for a long time, during that it risks the suspension: the public administration no longer works; the offices of the ministers do the report; the press research of the bad histories; and the government becomes on the defensive one and without more any objective.
In a direction, the position of Mr. Brown is particularly difficult, for in contrast to of other political leaders, it cannot praise itself to be a beginner.
Although it would wish to renounce Tony Blair, it anyway was his superior lieutenant.
The problems relating to the Rock Northern and to the tax data for example, are linked to the decisions of Mr. Brown taken when it was chancellor of the British treasure.
And even if it directly is not implied in the misfortunes of Blair, such the long investigation on the funds on the part "cash for the members of the House of Lords", the voters could think the opposite.
But the difficult position that incurs Mr. Brown is not so tragic that she seems some.
Blunder them are not so monstrous as the members on the part Tories do it to believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there is not any victim or swindle.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to make real the Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown of always, in favor of a reliable and lightly brutal government.
The new scandal on the political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special personage, that compares its donations to charity, declared that it did not wish any public recognition of his charity.
It can have his opinion, but this is not at him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big subventionneurs of the politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the knowledge right that contributes to the success of those that will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, that declared being during the course of the programs of Mr. Abrahams, without knowing that that was illegal, will have by consequence to be questioned, of even besides that Jon Mendlesohn, the person in charge of the collections of subsidies that had talked about the doubtful donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not implied: Nothing leave to think that it was during the course of the these gaits, even if most of the carried out payments were done following his arrival to the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister did the half.
It quickly condemned the legislative rift on his part, but it did not attract the attention on the Fact that the strength of decision rests on a thing that it connait well, done recourse to a committee of investigation on this subject composed from a bishop to the retirement and a judge.
In this case, the lesson to learn are not complicated.
And if the law was scorned, it is some spring of the police.
What's more, there is well something else that Mr. Brown must do, such as to find a permanent president for the independent committee of the Standard ones of public life, without leader since six months, and prepare a good reformation on the financially of political parties.
That would oblige the Labor party, in a weakness moment, to collaborate with the Tories, which could bring it to renounce his financial special report with the confederacies; in brief, a bitter pill for a supporter such Mr. Brown.
But it should confront certain facts supporters.
The party of the conservative ones disposes now of a good advantage for the elections; it is two years old to recover the voters, and the only manner to obtain a victory is to show an irreproachable integrity and of solid competences.
Card swindles.
Would the crisis of the hypothèques contaminate the American market of the cards of credit?
When there is blood in water, it is normal to see kindled fins, whirl around.
Now that the market of the real estate American crosses a critical phase, the predators aim at the American market of the cards of credit.
The analysts of with Goldman Sachs think that the losses linked to the credit cards could attain $ 99 billions if the contagion spreads itself hypothèques to others form credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the rates of the expenses and of insolvency, which measures the parts of the report non-récupérables or that are it, more than 30 days after.
HSBC announced the last month that it took $ 1,4 billions in its credits to the consumer, in left because of the weakness of the carriers of cards.
It is anyway too early to panic.
The expenses and the insolvencies again are moderated.
According to Moody, a fiscal agency, the rate of insolvency of 3.89% of the troixième quarter is inferior of almost a point in comparison with his historic average.
The rate deterioration is in left explainable by technical factors.
A law change in 2005 to the Etats-Unis,concernant the personal bankruptcy caused an abrupt fall of the archives of bankruptcy, that to his turn caused heavy losses for the credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore of rate of insolvency) could increase even if the loan conditions had to worsen.
The industry announces in addition rates of payment set up, that put in relief the sum of monthly debt that the consumers must regulate.
And the confidence in the sureté of the capital of the cards of credit is rather strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of the structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research corporation, predicted that the transmission volume for 2007 will be 25% superior one to the last year.
The direct links of infection between the crisis of the hypothèques and the market of the cards of credit exist certainly: the consumers could prefer to increase their debts now that the equitable real estate loans disappeared.
But the transmitting ones of cards do more attention to the flow of types rather than to the heritage value, and therefore the fall of the prices of the real estate one did not necessarily induce a change in the credibility of the borrowers.
They even could bring advantages to the transmitting ones of titles of credit.
The premiums to the consumers for the payment of the hypothèques fall if the property cost less than the value of the loan; by consequence, the debt by credit card would become a priority to pay again the all.
The transmitting ones of cards are able to reply a lot more quickly than the hypothécaires and with more of flexibility to such crisis conditions, for they can change the interest rate or impair the limits of rédit.
That would have in theory to reduce the risk to have a quick return of the actions.
"We not we will awaken a morning and revalue all the loans." declared Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial catastrophe of the market of the cards of credit is improbable, there are forts risk having a consequent decrease.
If the inferior prices of the real estate one and a contraction in the credit market bring the America towards the recession, the industry certainly will have to do facing a gruesome future.
Done well attention to the back fins..
The British bankers plead guilty for the case Enron.
The three British bankers that had to go to testify their roles in comparison with a fraud committed by the preceding financial director of Enron, Mr. Andrew Fastow, changed their declaration, pleading guilty Wednesdays.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were themselves first innocent declared of the seven accusations for presumed collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a financial secret swindle in order to enrich itself to the vexation of their employees.
They should present themselves to the court in January.
But during an audience presided by the American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they themselves all declared guilty to have committed a fraud.
The three former frameworks of Greenwich NatWest, an affiliate of the group PLC of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous everywhere in Great Britain because of the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
To the United States, their case still remains an unresolved question for this launched investigation after the fall of Enron in 2001.
The accusations that were inflicted for them in 2002, did to understand to Fastow that it was the object of the investigation of the government in the debacle of Enron.
The accusations against the bankers, nicknamed the "three of Natwest" declare having come to Houston in 2000, to organize a scenario frauduleux with Fastow and his former straight arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in an affiliate of a partner of Enron controlled by Fastow, that was the metteur in scene many scenarios frauduleux, that helped it àtruquer the procedures of bankruptcy.
At first of 2002, the bank had estimated his interest for the affiliate as no one, but in fact the three British already know his value.
A corporation controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the bank of the affiliate for £ 1 million.
The bankers paid $ 250,000 to Kopper as interest for this corporation.
According to the accused, Fastow falsely would have announced to Enron that the energy corporation was willing to to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its actions in the affiliate.
But in truth these $20 million went in the pockets of the British bankers, of Fastow and of others again.
According to the accusations, the bankers would have obtained $7,3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have won $ 12,3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pled guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in the debacle of Enron.
The British trio was stopped three months after.
Fastow endures a committal of six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were liberated after the payment of a guarantee of $ 1MILLION every, which the oblige to live to the United States during the process.
Enron, beforehand seventh bigger national corporation, in bankruptcy in December 2001 after the years of trucages accountants, not more could hide its billion debt or same to propose its speculations can as profitable.
The collapse provoked thousands of dismissals, more of $ 60 billion loss of value of the market and more of $ 2 billion loss for the retirement plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the former general president Jeffrey Skilling were condemned the last year, for their implication in the corporation collapse.
Skilling was condemned to more than 24 years of prison.
The accusations against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and of other offences were vain because of his due death to a cardiac crisis the last year.
Or under, or outside Moscow.
The cost of an airplane G550 Gulfstream, equipped of a motor rolls-royce and possessing an autonomy of sufficient fuel to fly without stop of Moscow to Los Angeles, leaves $ 54 million.
But that is only a small change for certain Russians.
"It can transport until 18 passengers" declared Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really has need so much of seats seen that it is a matter more of an airplane of family usage or for the president of a corporation".
Mr. Firer was present to the stand of Gulfstream, last Friday, to the Parlor of the Millionaires, an incentive orgy to the consumption, during four days, that is held in a huge center of exposition to the capital surroundings.

Authorities did not again determine the causes of the death of Melle Arroyo, but they await confiding, the results of the tests toxicologiques that, alas will take time, but that should allow resolving this mysterious death that saddened the high rows of the police of Newark.
Melle Arroyo was attending it director of the police, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.

Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will diminish the rates linked to the turmoil of the world-wide stock market.
The actions are exploded of the two quotations of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried of calm the conditions of the credit, reducing later the interest rate promoted by the declarations appeasing vice president of the American central bank.
The stock market markets explode to London, New York and everywhere in Europe after Donald Kohn, n° 2 after Well Bernanke, president of the Federal Reserve, declared that those that decide, must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial restless markets.
In an evident effort to reassure the irritable markets seen these new tensions linked to the credit, Mr. Kohn declared that the recent turbulence has in left "certain inverted improvements in the market functioning at the end of September and October.
In case this length turbulence had to persist, that would increase the probabilities of a later rigidity of the financial conditions for the owners and the businesses, has- it declared.
These commentaries appear to the investors as an evident signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject again capitals in the American markets, and that of later decreases of the interest rate could stabilize the credit conditions.
These remarks also allowed calm Wall Street with of the new even more bad one on the American economy, such as the biggest decrease of real estate sales for the month of October.
Passed on them of this financial commotion was stressed after the declaration of Bear Stearns, investment bank, announcing that she will dismiss 650 persons, c'est-à-dire, 4% of his personnel, to reduce the expenses to compensate the heavy due losses to the Paris losing real estate loans.
20 posts only are foreseen to London where the bank employs 1500 persons.
To New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones increased of 331 points, be 2.55% conclusive one to 13.289,40 while the index more big, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
To London, the index FTSE 100 took 165.5 points be 2.7% conclusive one to 6306.2 adding more than 39£ to the value of the British corporations.

The pressures on the Bank of England to follow the FED and the ECB and inject later funds in the of London financial markets provoking tensions of the credit, did that the loan rates sort monthly "Libor" the British banks, caused their higher growth since last September, to 6.59% continuation a strong ascent since November 12.
England does facing a call to the judgement in comparison with the critics of Owais Shah and Delighted Bopara.
We are facing two dilemmas, the one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the drummer n°6 for the England to Kandy this week end, Owais Shah or Delighted Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first Test against the Sri Lanka, that will take the decision?
The second question is important for David Graveney, the president of the sélectionneurs that was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, boss trainer, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to take his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the General Guiding President of England, begins filling the candidacy forms to become a national sélectionneur, at least leaves time.
The one that will not arrive to win number n°6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and the sport it east equally.
This never is easy to annihilate what allows a man to arrive to the top of his profession while another never will arrive besides the inferior level, sometimes by lacks luck more than by lacks of empower.
There is not that to the cricket that the selection is difficult, for to the end, the judgement remains subjective.
Is the good moment to let Bopara emerge?
Is this just one in comparison with Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, that to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both of them, new frameworks having obtained from good diplomas, professional, should be promoted: but it has not place that for a single one of them.
Who has the right to determine the just level of a cricketeur unless one grants him at least a luck?
The figures have their importance in the decisions, but also timeliness.
Inside a team, a cricketeur must capture the eye of the captain, at the same time it must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketeur of a day.
But to capture the eyes of the sélecteurs well more is complicated.
A lot more better did the last season, for example, James Anderson that seemed certain to play the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison declared itself in the middle of the form and continued of s'entrainer itself to serve.
Anderson took 32 doors of first class on 33 turns to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 to the same average, but both of them already lived their glory moment to the biggest level and hope to offer again.
If that will be Shah or Bopara that will play stadium Asgiriya, that is only an opinion question.
This choice could annihilate or construct the career of a man, but that few done difference.
Four years ago, to the Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and well succeeded in the first one, with five doors and 40 useful turns, but this was Paul Collingwood, that fought also to emerge, that succeeded becoming the essential cricketeur of the Test, and that, despite the Fact that his double hundred brand against the Australia in Australia can be again under estimated.
The probability foresees that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, after another discussion after the session of today to the stadium Asgiriya, will follow certainly their conservative instincts and will favor the biggest experience of Shah against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
The two have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable beginning to the innings of the Test of 88 to Bombay, 32 hundred of first class against six for Bopara, that to 22ANS is seven younger years, and his excellent classification to the launch.
But Shah did only ten turns at the time of its two innings in May against the Caribbean ones during the Test to Lord, his city of player of the Middlesex, and that, the rejection immediate by the sélectionneurs when Vaughan again in form, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted its so evident momenta to Bombay.
In contrast to him, the player of Essex is full of joy of life.
Nothing does not scare for him on a land of cricket and it exaggerated when it recently collapsed on a 4x4 at the time of a presentation of Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
It put back only light injuries, was shocked, even if the first thing that it did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his team member that looked at it by far, for him to ask s "'it had seen that?"
Bopara is by far the better drummer, his pace spinning allows for him to do the services that go for him, and that it beats with confidence and professionnalité.
Choose the just man is a thing, choose the good moment is another.
Can be is this the true art of the selection?
I would be propice to give his luck to Bopara, what does not want to say that Shah must not apply if, such the tea leaves suggest it will be him that will play this week end.
The buses bring back the people to the work, and to fight against Al Qaeda.
The first refugee full bus Iraqis originating Syria arrived to Baghdad yesterday, pouring these exiles without money or without renewals of aim, or of others again that hope that the city rediscovered the normalcy.
Some returned to fight against the campaigning that moved away them from at their place.
To the station of bus Mansour, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 transported persons in convoys of dozens of bus of the official government, the final one was filled refugee of Syria and of Jordan that returned by their means.
"I decided to go in Syria after they killed several doctors to Baghdas" declared Sabah Al Qubaisi, a doctor Sunni.
"I returned today for I saw to the TV and read in the newspapers which happened to Baghdâd and seen that the city is more turn sour now."
"They say that the army Mahdi no longer commits crimes!" it declared, referring itself to the militia Shia of the campaigning ecclesiastical Moqtada Al Sadr, that imposed on its men to move away itself for the moment.
Qassim Al Atwani, one teaching Shia of 38 years of the zone of Amariyah dominated by the Sunni, returned with its two children, for it not more could renew his aimed Syrian and for the system prevents the Iraqis to work.
Its neighbors of Shia to Amariyah called it to inform it that the militia helped by the United States, allowed hunting Al Qaeda of the west of the capital, and invited it to return.
One of the new ones arriving from Jordan is the boss of a tribe Sunni and Shia that had to leave his house to the north of Baghdâd because of an attack to the grenade after it incited the citizens to rebel against Al Qaeda.
But it had to return to fight.
"Two days ago, certain of my friends called me and said me to have set up a militia anti Al Qaeda to Sleikh, and that they needed me and of my boys."
"Here why I return today" declared Sabaah Alu Obeidi, of 62 years.
A lot say to have attracted by the lull growing the capital since that the American troops arrived, and to the formation view continues of "groups of implied citizens" well armed and collaborating with the American military officers to defend their neighborhood.
But again of others say having been obliged to return because of the problem of aim and decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have flees the past years.
Salaam Al Samarrai, 51 years, father of three children, expressed suspicion felt by all about the aimed for exiled that Nouri Al Maliki, the Prime Minister Shia, that would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force the people to return to the country.
More than two million and half of persons would have flees country because of the sectarian escadrons of the death.
"We had not any problem until Al Maliki comes in Syria and incites the government to not more to give of aim to the Iraqis, to force them to return in Iraq "declared the retired Sunni.
"I cannot have confidence in a government that supports the criminals that burned my house when I left".
The violence decrease can be in left explained by the Fact that the Sunnis were hunted zones of Shia and vice poured, creating places where tensions are least.
One fears that a refugee sudden flow does not increase again sectarian tensions and bring back the fight.
Small Sarre, good formation.
The smallest federated State takes regarding formation professionelle, and shines even of by the international orientation of its superior schools.
This is only in a domain that a deficit weighs on the sarrois, similar to the one of the remainder of the country.
"I have exliqué yesterday for the 50th time to a non-sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by autodérision, posts for his 50th birthday.
To this level, France and the Luxembourg play a big role in the system of formation of the Sarre, system that is placed fifth in the supervisor of the formations of the Institute of German economy of Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, the superior schools cooperate narrowly with the countries neighbors.
The university was been founded to Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
Until this day, the students have the possibility of there to finish their studies by a double, indeed a triple diploma.
Some testifies the high quotitée of 15.6 percent of foreign students.
The Sarre drives besides she also the children of the country until the superior schools in superior number to the average - a lot of them without a diploma of the Gymnasium.
"In Sarre, one takes advantage of the system of professional formation", said Axel Plünnecke, expert in formation with IW.
More of a young one on five obtains his study title in a professional school, thus the Sarre is situated in more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combination of a professional and academic formation comparatively are well developed.
To the view of the number of inhabitants, the panel of double program is the second better one of Germany.
Despite a formation practices and a request growing, the number of diplomés in engineering nevertheless lowered of a third in the last years.
Here why the Ministry of the education sarrois obliged the superior schools to a marketing country in the matters of sciences of the engineer.
"After the first studies PISA, we celebrated a big number of reformations in the general schools.", says a spokesperson of the Ministry of the education.
Thus the government introduced in all the federated state of the tests of comparison.
For that the children begin earlier to learn, the last year of crêche is exempts right - a model that entretemps of other federated states copy also.
Only of future studies of comparison will be able to show if student performances improve in a manner durable.
In the studies PISA in 2003, the student quota to risks reduced itself of 29 to 20 percent.
Altogether nevertheless, the Sarre did not improve as much as of other federated states.
The Bavarian one itself come out more better some.
And to the big vexation of the sarrois, the knowledge in foreign languages are not measured by the studies PISA - one can otherwise to win points in this domain.
For the language of the neighbor is obligatory in the high schools - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chávez rule the watches
To the Vénézuela, the watches will do soon tic tap otherwise that in the world remainder.
December 9, the president Hugo Chavez will do to climb back up the stopwatch of a half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez becomes entretemps a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of the Vénézuela communicated it, owing to a new law, the watches will be regulated to less four hours and half of the universal time.
Of this manner, the South American country obtains a spindle schedule that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The Anti-american Chávez justified his position among others by the Fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of the spindles schedules in full hours.
Of more, Chávez announced Wednesday (local hour) relation suspension with the country neighbor, the Colombia, owing to a matter of hostages.
The nationalist left one announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe would remain president of Colombia, it would not maintain relations or with the head of state, or with the Colombian government.
"I do not can it, already only because of my dignity", said Chávez that hastens a constitutional reformation on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by way of referendum Sunday.
With this reformation, it would reinforce noticeably his strength in the country.
The element trigger of this dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw to Chávez the mandate of negotiations about the liberation of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "spat to the face" Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain also Chávez is in all the mouths.
A new beep of portable telephone does fury in the country: "Por qué no you callas" (why not you tais-tu you) is the sentence that already more of a millions of half persons downloaded on internet.
She was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos that, to the most recent summit ibéro-américain, was irritated by the constant questioning of the left populists and that said for him of be quiet itself.
A salary decrease threatens the Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong situation, according to a prediction, a true less worth salary threatens the German employees this year.
Experts quoted all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prediction.
According to a foundation calculation Hans böckler, the employees should expect in 2007 to a real decrease on their pay card in comparison with the preceding year.
"The fault comes back to the weak development of the salaries, to the increase of the Tax on the added value and to the climbed of the prices of the food products and energy", said Gustav Horn of the Institute for the macro-économie and the research on situation, to the newspaper "Bild".
Of new loads also could intervene regarding assurance-chômage for the employee.
The Minister of the finances Peer Steinbrück said to the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the foreseen decrease of the assurance-chômage of 3.3 percent for the new year was of course correct and reasonable in the current position.
Nevertheless the national Agency for the job no longer has the right to find itself in the difficulty to ask the Federation of the credits or financial assistance, according to the words of the politician of SPD.
One knew Tuesday that the explosion of the prices of the food products and hydrocarbons had pushed the rate of inflation to his higher level for 13 years.
Altogether, the prices increased of 3.0 percent of a year to the other.
Venus is the twin infernal one Earth.
Despite his hostile atmosphere to life, Venus resembles more to the Earth than this than one believed until now: the European spatial probe "Come Express" discovered flashes in the atmosphere and whirlwinds of wind to the centers, similar to those that appear in the winter on Earth.
Since almost three decades, the scientists suppose that there are flashes on Venus.
The European probe "Come Express" some today brought the proof - she detected electromagnetic waves to atmosphere limit: the flashes on Venus burst to a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud in cloud, retrieves Christopher Russel of the University of California to Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the theory celebrates cyprine, the flashes would have let the life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that drove to the formation of amino acids, rock of angle of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life there was, that must have been at a very old date of the History", explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" to Washington.
It should not have today hardly living things to the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about hundred denser time than on Earth, it there reigns sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is maybe the infernal twin Earth, but she remains a twin one", said Russel.
Why Venus, that resembles so to the Earth in mass and dimensions, was hit with an evolution so different, is the basic question of the mission ASE.
The departure of "Come Express" in November 2005 was an important step in the research vénusienne, since more no probe was in road for the exploration of this planet since the years eighty ten.
Opinion of the researchers, the most recent results of research that now were presented in several items of "Nature" do not underline only the oddity of Venus within the solar system.
They show also as the common points with the Earth of our planéte neighbor are more numerous more than more supposed initially.
Thus the researchers found, besides the whirlwinds of wind déja known to the center north, a cloud whirlwind to the center south, that turns again well more quickly.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the earthly hemispheres in the winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the said Istituto Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planéte of the solar sytème has almost it same mass that the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 measure the mileage, almost so big.
The qualified planéte of star in the evening or in the morning revolves around the sun in all just 225 days.
She turns nevertheless well more slowly on itself: a day vénusien lasts 243 land days.
Although Venus, with temperatures in surface of 460 Celsius degrees and a pressure of 92 bars, does not recall hardly the Earth, the scientists suppose that the two planétes constituted themselves in similar conditions.
On the two, water accumulated itself and remained on the Earth in the form of an oceans, but lost itself in the space on Venus.
And while the dioxyde of carbon set up itself on Earth in the form of a carbonate, it constitutes on Venus more big party of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends the encounter of Merkel with the Dalaï Llama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the quarrel end on the part about the welcome of the Dalaï Llama to Ministry of justice.

The entry in utopian scene of the chancellor shows that the coalition finished some with the bottom - and that there is no longer any nothing to await of her.
Does in which country live this chancellor exactly?
After his distressing intervention in the general debate of the German Parliament, that was chaotic and poor content, it is necessary to say: not here - not in the country that would have, to the final one, to be governed by her.
The reproach of too to concentrate on the political one was pushed back by Angela Merkel of a sentence lasts and presumptuous.
It is provincial, she said and only showed by there that she does not want to understand what want the critics.
To the Parliament, she rendered visible of all to which not at all this reproach was exact.
It had not or concrete interest or hardly of feelings for the country problems to feel.
To the place, Angela presented itself as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, that flees in the political foreign one and that even there remains in l'à-peu-près.
For example the climate protection: in this matter, she congratulates herself again and again on the agreements of Heiligendam, but does not say how the objectives on the climate will have to be attained in our country.
Even, the praise of oneself - to have so few modesty, the boss of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now she herself clingy to ready-made phrases, that the growth would touch the people.
By there she destroys his picture of pragmatiste, that resolves the problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the empire of the cloud Angela, the problems of political interior are a marginal phénomème.
The poverty with the children and the preoccupations of the workers down with salary?
It remains him some incidental sentences for that.
In this matter is revealing the number of time where she does freudian slips when it is a matter of family benefits.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a sentence to precise half.
She staggers in unknown land, from the moment where that becomes concrete.
The branch Attacks
In the debate of Youtube of the republican candidates to the presidential one, the two favorite Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver themselves to a length battle offensive - and now must fear a candidate outsider.
The tension of the candidates already bursts to the first subject.
It would have done New York a "refuge for the clandestine ones", reproaches Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This one against of his side by of heavy reproaches: "I would say that his own house was a havre for clandestine" replies Giuliani and accuses the former governor of the Massachussetts to have employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates climb to the attack: as the republican basis has not in addition any official favorite, the eight candidates to the presidential one use the debate on CNN before all to discredit their opponents.
The avid films of 30 seconds that the users of Internet sent through Youtube are scarcely more than souffleurs.
"This is with this isolationism kind that we left Hitler to come in power", launches John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul that is the only one in the round one to claim an immediate collection of Iraq.
Romney also is done to do the lesson vigorous by the veterans of the Vietnam, when it refuses to condemn as a torture which one calls the "Waterboarding", a questioning method where one simulates drowning.
Nevertheless the Fact that the important themes of the country go entretemps beyond the war in Iraq and debate on the torture sees itself in the reactions of the common room of St. Petersburg in Florida.
What the conservative values are rented or that the future increases of taxes are refused, applause erupt in the public studio.
This is there that reveal themselves once more where resident the weaknesses of the two favorite ones.
"I did an error to this era", explains apologetic and present Romney its excuse to the basis and to the televised public to have in 1994 again summers a favoring abortion.
Giuliani on the contrary passes in a knot flowing when one asks him his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil.
A day after his collection as army boss, the man of Pakistani strength Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus eight years of domination by the army finish.
The president of the Pakistan Pervez Musharraf was invested Thursday for a new mandate of five years.
The Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the Nation.
Wednesday it had transmitted his load of boss of the armies to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and s'etait itself thus folded to the international pressure, notably the one of the United States.
Eight years after his taken one of strength by a putsch without blood effusion, the former general reigns henceforth for the first time as civil head of state.
By this collection of the post of commander in chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had filled the principal requirement of the opposition and West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of urgency that Musharraf had decreed November 3.
Already shortly after his nomination Musharraf will suspend the urgency state, according to the general prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and will thus fill another requirement of the West.
The supreme Court of the country, that Musharraf had occupied after the instauration of the state of urgency with lawyers of its rows, had rejected last week all the recourses against the controversial reelection of the head of state October 6.
Entretemps five soldiers were killed in the tribal region of the north in Waziristan of the North in an attempt against a military convoy, and four injured others.
According to the indications of the Spokesperson of the army, a bomb exploded in a street close to the border of the Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock do their return.
The supergroupes of the Germany of the years seventy replay: the three members of the group Harmonia have again take their console in a concert to Berlin.
For their return are appeared recordings of their big success "Live 1974".
Already to this era, they well more were known abroad.
The foreseen sensation produces itself next in the form of three announced sirs to the poster in the evening.
Each has his small one drunk in front of him, his cable and before all its buttons.
Dieter Moebius, to 63 years, hold court in the middle in a white shirt as snows.
It is flanked to the left Michael Rother, young of 57 years and in possession of a laptop and of a guitar.
To right, observed by all the public studio, Hans joachim Roedelius, 73 years, bends itself on his console.
Each contributes to the noise, among others even a Beat.
And sometimes that adds itself by oversight to a piece of traditional music.
That does not seem besides too to disturb the sirs themselves.
The Fact that it group Harmonia plays again assured some emotions among the amateurs of Krautrock.
One has the right to unveil it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name reasons in the collective memory of the pop one, but in any case in a manner so durable for as this group lacks also painfully for 32 years.
But why the German not would it have also the right to celebrate its living legends of the years seventy?
So much more than which misleadingly is called "Krautrock" always more pleased in England and in America than in the country of origin.
Lorque the industry of the music awarded in 2003 the price Echo to the survivors of the group of Cologne Can for their work, one saw in the room the pop questioning German faces.
When the Red Hot Chile Peppers also thanked the groups The Düsseldorf and Neu! in the praise panegyric, astonishment no longer had limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the scene of the Red Hot Chile Peppers as an old friend.
The ignorance problem with oneself and the transfiguration in the unknown one is the only one and unique.
The memory is therefore déja taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and that during this period, the impact strength that felt itself was well weaker than which was attributed for him afterward by of others.
Moebius and Roedelius already had played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
One played first in the cellars underneath the Berlin scene.
Next to Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother briefly had fixed in Kraftwerk and finally had done itself a name as guitarist with Neu!, that was at the era maybe it German group the most radical one.
About 1973, Rother followed nevertheless the musicians of Cluster in exile in the fôrets of the Weserbergland.
There, in a former farm of the Weser, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of evasive communities the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Kommune I", where Roedelius had the right to do itself to torment as nurse.
Rather an artistic existence to the manner of Spitzweg.
Supposedly was located in the garbage can a fanion of the choral Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for the art.
A lot kept Harmonia far of that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following one "Of Luxury".
For so serene and modest as rang the music, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood did not serve to him only to the research of oneself.
The CD "Live 1974" that has just appeared was recorded at the time of a concert to Griessem in front of a public record closely of 50 heads, as well as someone believes to remember.
Emitted Rother to this era the wish to force Harmonia to train time in time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius an immoral requirement.
The group announced his separation in 1975.
Rother atterit in the spheres of the ésotérisme and assured his existence with albums as "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived in the years eighty and has since more success than Harmonia in never had.
One has the album Live of Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set up itself the goal to maintain the Krautrock as inherent German contribution to the contemporary music.
Neu! had déja been dug up on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of the cultures of the world to Berlin.
Subsidized publicly, in the framework of the Festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, punk old and author of the book of pocket "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Clod.
By which the body of the margin of fluctuation of the influence of the Krautrock would be surrounded with regard to the future pop music.
The left place empties by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno glides in the room in the middle of the unique sounds: "The true only music, you listen the future".
There exist the photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm piece.
The projections of other photos in black and white of cabled tools in bazaar serve to the legend formation.
In front of, the three veterans are again occupied to improvise.
But more while sticking microphones to the organ and to the battery, to pull to the instruments of the unheard-of sounds thanks to the instruments to effects construct oneself.
Today, the electronic music resembles the electronic music.
The three in big perfectionists of technique.
Thereto even the choral one of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, one coughs and whispers under the sound cloud, and one sings to a pretty moment "Aaaaaaaah" with pomposity.
Krautrock always was a very English concept.
It is himself never is a question of rock one.
The roots less were looked for in the blues that in the music conservatories (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of the artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one that screams "68" has not totally wrong, and Harmonia also does not leave itself now more to irritate by that henceforth.
But which goes the more of oneself will be covered meticulous on the scene.
Where begins the music and where does she finish?
Can that type on the nerves of someone (?) or well to grant fugaces moments of big joy.
Richard Gere is not all simply step rather cynical.
With "The Hunting Party" and "deadly Peace", two films approach again the war of the Balkans.
But the two do not convince.
Be the projects rest of too on the action and on the exchanges of insane shooting on the contrary they are too crying.
Here, same Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" cannot help.
The good new one first: of course the criminals of war Karadzic and Mladic hide themselves still in the mountains of the Balkans, but this is exactly there, in the arrière-pays more gloomy of the war of Bosnia, that the actor Richard Gere then is rediscovered.
We had finally lost view more beautiful man of the years eighty, because a lot nice too many roles and futils in films to feelings for women and a lot too much press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him the craving to show itself.
Today Richard Gere suddenly is the most important argument to look at nonetheless "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunt (why the films of today must they be so long and confused as of the collective conventions of drivers of locomotives?)
It delivers a magnificent representation a lot of winks: to the bottom, his personage to put back war Simon Hunt Gere could have become, if the destiny and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man that has its better moments since a long time behind him, but that, even as monument in ruin to his decline, nevertheless kept remainders.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" follows together with the German production "deadly Peace", that goes out also this week, the unending continuation of spoiled films on the war of the Balkans.
Of "deadly Peace" one can do quickly the process: the film talks about two German soldiers to the Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), that save a Serbian of the frank Kosovar marksmen, in which one of the two again grave promptly in love.
Although it be welcome that here the Serbians be not for once presented as the only causes of all the evil, this film as flat as a téléfilm loses itself well too quickly in the action and the exchanges of insane shooting.
That remains a sort of "Alarms for Cobra 11" without expressway but with a war to the place.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why to the bottom it never had a good true film on the war of the Balkans.
The history of the three put back American wars, that condition themselves to track the criminal top of war "the fox", maybe could have become, with another director and another scriptwriter (both of them at once Richard Shepard), to another moment a new one "Apocalypse Now".
Because the histories resemble themselves manner striking: two males go in small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military officers cannot do and for the two males, that becomes a trip in the madness.
One of the reasons of the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that one does not leave simply Simon Hunt to be the cynical one deserted endowed with a heart, as it presented us at first.
No, the script must attribute for him moreover a romantic adventure with a murdered bosnian afterward.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when to put back it, in the space of the five last minutes, by an accelerated procedure, succeeds in what NATO, the CIA and all the hunters of premiums of the world did not succeed in five years: to catch the criminal of war and to leave it for a just vengeance to the Moslem bosnians.
This is so bad that one should seize the international Course of the Hague of crime against the film logic.
In this case, the film has a human too deep preoccupation.
It wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are again in liberty, and it suspects the Americans and the French (here they exceptionally must be agreed) of not to drive the hunt in a manner rather intensive because of secret political accord.
But the intentioned good and the mean one are this time so similar that a famous poême of Brecht comes us to the idea.
The one talks about a mask drinks some of an Asian demon on the table of work of the poête: "Compassionate, I see the veins of the inflated foreheads, clearly: as this is tiring to be mean."
The films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly of such heads tumescentes, but that insinuate to which not at all it is tiring to be good.
The problem is not limited to the film kind on the war of the Balkans.
Recently, it was retrieved in this newspaper that all the Hollywood films on the Iraq were big flops.
One can add: it again never had good films on South Africa.
Which is worth every time: when a star leads on a home of crisis or on a minefield, it goes out some next something as "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits to go Grenzen" with Pretty Angelina or "" Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts be again simply too close in the time.
Although it be some, decades always are passed before Hollywood can turn a good film on the holocaust with "The list of Schindler".
Certain films well again must ripen - those that are worth today classical works on the Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" not in any case were celebrated unanimously to their era as masterpieces.
But maybe in know we today also simply too on the world conflicts, where every hécatombe arrives live on two screens at the same time to the house,
And that delighted to the scriptwriters lacks it scruples of which they need to relate beautiful histories.
"To be or not to be" or "The dictator" are in so good become fact also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not know again to which not at all the Nazi system dominated really.
Maybe that it is not necessary to want to be good when one wants to do good flims.
Maybe it is necessary to have the sarcastic artistic look and left behind of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When one questioned it on the parallel between his historic novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war of the Balkans, it replied: "That holds only to certain the Fact that things never change".
"The big cities always will be horribly dangerous, the men always will be murdered of a facon horrifying and the war will reign always in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust harvests the critic for the cancellation of the Olympiades.
The taken one of decline of the mayor of with the candidacy of Hamburg for the Olympic Games of summer bumped itself in the political one and the economy to virulent critics.
A lot want to continue to beat itself for the Games by water.
But Von Beust calls for the realism in the luck assessment.
The principal director of the Room of commerce of Hamburg, Hans jörg schmidt-trenz, described Wednesday an abandonment as being "bad for the local economy".
The latter times, no other project had deployed as much forces of motivation in the city that the idea of the Olympiades.
"Without this objective, the momentum politico-sportif could not have been maintained in the even measure".
Schmidt-trenz invites the Senate to not to bury the project, but to him to find a new point of departure to longer term, "that takes as no departure another modified diary".
The mayor Ole von Beust remained some Wednesday to its preceding declarations, according to which ones olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"This is not Hamburg that decides of a candidacy to the Olympiades, but the German Federation of the olympic sports" said Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
It renvoit to the discounted decision of the Federation of the sports at the beginning of December, about the candidacy of Munich for the games of winter of 2018.
This preference means for us, that, in the time period that we had foreseen until 2028 even there, we will have no luck."
Nevertheless dreams it does not belong definitively to the passed, said Von Beust.
The athletic Federation of Hamburg (HSB) regretted the declarations of Beust.
Of that the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to put his candidacy for the Olympic Games in the 25 next years.
"It is too early to close itself a timeliness, while burying the projects already now", said Wednesday the President of the HSB Günter Ploß.
A candidacy abandonment would be of more in contradiction with the declarations of the boss of the Senate to the welcome occasion some assembled pleinière of the German Federation of the superior schools of the sport.
Over there, Von Beust would have qualified the candidacy of Hamburg to the Universiades of 2015 as not being "a substitute" to the Olympic Games to Hamburg.
The Federation of the superior schools of the sport had first in the past nominated weeks Hamburg as city candidate.
The fraction SPD of the mayor accused the Senate of not to have used this precious time in the lodging construction to Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grasbrook was refused by the Senate during years because it played the card of the Olympiades and excluded the lodging construction", said the delegates of the SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD always claimed for the Small Grasbrook a plan integrated in the Olympiades and a posterior usage of the lodgings, the CDU would have bet exclusively on the "factor Event".
The candidacy for the Olympic Games of summer in 2012 for its part would have raised to Hamburg a big enthusiasm.
Hamburg nevertheless had broken itself against Leipzig.
This are not the cash registers of Warhols.
The one that links up the concepts Sweden and cash register drinks some, thinks about Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or well if?
In this moment, cash registers in drinks made in Sweden throw shadows on the list of the works of Warhol.
A big party of the eighty ten brillo-boxs of "Type Stockholm" listed over there are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned some months ago the authenticity of the brillo-boxs of the year 1968 of Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm result today to a result désenchanteur: the six "brillo-boxes", of which the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten did gift in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a big one Stockholm", that circulate on the international market of the art.
The old history is tangled, a disconcerting chain of artistic productions and curatoriques.
In 1964, Warhol created to New York its first ones "brillo-boxes", cash registers in drinks painted, that base themselves on red design-blue-white of the boxes of savon in powder "Brillo".
An exposition of his work to the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - hundreds of cash registers Brillo done box: These did not originate (for financial reasons) of Warhol, but directly had been delivered factory of cardboard boxes Brillo.
It was not a matter not here of works of art, but rather of their models, of samples of exposition.
At the same time, Warhol had well given the authorization in 1968 to let some cash registers produce drinks some Brillo in Sweden, that were not besides exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the era speak today of about fifteen cash registers drinks some that to the era would have entered right in the history of the art and bids, as original brillo-boxes of Andy Wahrol authorized, with the appelation "Type Stockholm".
Certain of them attained in the sales to the more than 100 bids 000 dollars.
The problem henceforth is that the legendary director of the museum Pontus Hultén claimed, to wrong, later than about hundred cash registers drinks some had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol next would have yielded for him.
In truth, the 105 cash registers of Hultén were produced to Malmo in 1990 only, for an exposition to st-pétersbourg.
To this date, Warhol already was dead for three years.
Lars Byström, conservative in boss of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the six brillo-boxes of the museum, three others of private collections suedoises, among which ones two were prepared to Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and sanded, next one applied with a paint brush to the white oil.
The copy texture that date back to the year 1990 unveils on the contrary that the paint directly was applied without puts to bed bottom on the stratified panels, using a paint roll - of more it is not a matter no a paint to the oil, but of an acrylic one.
"These cash registers were not authorized by the artist and should be removed official list of the brillo-boxes of Andy Warhol", gives to understand the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' to New York not some comes another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six cash registers in his collection as copies/material of exposition."
Already in July the Authentication Board well heard announced, that it would investigate on the "heavy accusations" that will be raised in the matter of the cash registers of savon in powder.
But since one oneself ring over there of an inéxorable silence.
The Soldiers rebel Manila abandon
In the Philippine, the rebellious soldiers abandon, the even that took up position in a hotel to Manila, and that had demanded the collection of the president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The boss Antonio Trillanes, that accused the President the corruption and the electoral fraud, said to the put back in the hotel that it would not know to reply of any effusion of blood.
The in power faithful soldiers had little before take assault the hotel using gas lacrimogène.
The two dozens of soldiers took up position since hours in the building.
About the half of them were held Wednesday in front of the courts because of an attempt of missed putsch in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
It took audience advantage to eclipse itself suddenly with about 30 getting along.
The military policemen, that normally had to oversee them, apparently had deserted in his favor and had joined themselves to his mutiny.
They s'introduirent themselves in the hotel Peninsula and demanded the collection of the President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The in power loyal troops curled the sector around the respectable hotel.
The President summoned an urgent meeting of the Office of security.
The national Counselor for the security Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"The people have some enough", said Trillanes.
"We call the persons to rejoin".
The general Danilo Lim, that ordered before the unity of elite of the Scouts Arrange, declared that of other unities of the army wanted under little to join itself to the market.
The system critics had called for a big demonstration against the President Wednesday.
His government is surrounded since months by the corruption reproaches.
The neighborhood of the finances of Manila already was since 2003 the theater of the attempt of mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
Insurrection broke itself close to 24 hours after to the refusal of the army of itself there to join.
Since 1986 it there already had at least seven attempts of putsch against elected governments democratically to the Philippine ones.
United Internet becomes a principal shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet assured itself a participation of more than 20 percent of the corporation of telecommunications Versatel.
The price average by action is of 14.46 Euros, as communicated it the corporation Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the social capital would be held.
One had speculated déja beforehand on a buyback.
The option would remain opened to increase again the participation in Versatel.
With this step one tries to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of the DSL, communicated United Internet.
Just before, assumptions already had been done Wednesday about an entry, after the bank Berenberg increased his participation to the operator of network of Düsseldorf of 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institute would hold money only for a third party, one relates on the market.
The day before, United Internet already had obtained a participation closely of 10 percent in the corporation of mobile communication Drillisch.
In the framework of an increase of capital, Drillisch placed in stock Market 17.4 million new actions of a value of 106.4 million Euros.

For the moment, the two corporations want to estimate themselves satisfied of their participation of ten percent with Freenet, and not done usage of their right to endorse 18.49 additional percent with Freenet, confided United Internet Thursday.
The two corporations would leave themselves nevertheless all the open options, all particularly to increase the participation in the HIS Freenet, one has learn.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had come to an end to the mi-octobre.
The again poker with difficulty predictable on Freenet that lasts since months is part of the consolidation of the German market of the telecommunications.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 millions of customers secured by a contract of mobile communication and 1.27 millions of customers DSL and complete subscriptions.
The holding Company of United Internet and Drillisch held until now a direct participation to Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It henceforth was suited that Drillisch would bring about four additional percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the corporation of investment Vatas had déja summer decided in August.
