What is the cuenta? čssd in Prague knows no nor voldemort nor the pastelería
The new concejales of čssd in the capital are going to have to overcome, it seems, the barreras language for obvious that the components of the board of Prague and Council township entiendan to its renewed compañeros of ODS.
The period aktuálně.cz "surveyed" to the new members of the Council of čssd to verify their knowledge of the sharp slang language (TOEFL) that has emerged in the last few years in the Council gobernaban Prague, when the current members of the coalition.
The diccionario codificado of the flor and nata political Prague during the previous period, from Mayor Pavel bém, includes some of the characters, situations and causes of the best-known metrópolis.
Strikingly, has been comprobado that new concejales almost not known comprenden these concepts.
At least, that they say.
"who is voldemort?"
"The truth is that did not sé."
Rather, "I am a novato in politics praguense," afirmó during the review of terminología of "colegueo" the concejal of culture lukáš kaucký.
And in terms veterano political reacted to the same, Karel březina.
Perhaps conozcan the concept of "hoyo golf."
"possibly be the only expression of all the preguntasteis that I use that once in when."
"If not, not normally employment slang."
On the glosario, whose defined published the newspaper aktuálně.cz the past junio before Congress's voting ODS, the redacción escogió six examples, in particular those that are especially associated with municipal authorities Prague.
The Socialists had to explicar the concepts of "voldemort," "greater hoyo of golf Prague," "go to the pastelería," "nuca bull," treason "of the capital," and "blindar."
Three concejales accepted submitting to the test, and a cuarto, antonín weinert, which in future will be responsible for education, the praga agreed in principle, but not coger returned to the phone.
The fifth concejal, Petr dolínek directly, refused to do so.
"I don't I meto in these things or I think how divierten valuing the civic demócratas."
"What does me matters is how we entenderemos in the execution of our programs," señaló.
As we have seen, supposedly the concejal lukáš kaucký not had dado realize that the título previous is an expression on an influential empresario and a friend of exalcalde bém, Roman janoušek.
To kaucký the word "voldemort" not he says nothing; the only término that acertó in the test "is the largest of hoyo golf Prague."
"It is the túnel blanka," says that kaucký, añade immediately: "but rather know it by the news."
"I'm going to have to apuntar to a course of languages, bromea."
Karel březina is not the only thing that reconoce in the hoyo golf of the túnel blanka, but also the concejal of East ambiente lukáš plachý.
Then, both sociodemócratas know who is really voldemort and lukáš plachý even he knows where to find that personaje; moreover, suspicion, the meaning of "go to the pastelería."
"creo wants to go to say that a company of Prague"; soon be desvela to plachý that it is the headquarters of firms janoušek.
The igual that březina, suggests that such knowledge obtuvo them of the news, but not emplea such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, between the sociodemócratas there is no glosario so familiar terms of coloquiales.
"I asked my colleagues, but really seems that we do not have nothing like this."
"Well, more between US utilizamos apodos, sometimes abreviaturas or we games of words with names," says the President of the čssd praguense, Petr hulínský, whose party colleagues call hulda.
"In the beginning of school me llamaban bříza, but not if I also know my fellow llaman so," confiesa its own apodo Karel březina.
The newspaper aktuálně.cz tested by the name and functions.
For his party colleagues, weinert is děda (similar to "yayo"), or less friendly, dědek ("viejo"), the representante Miroslav poche, with which it was asociaron before the elections engaños during the aegis of the Party, receives an "igráček" ("playmobil") on the part of some of their colleagues.
The apodos are also the only expresiones that the sociodemócratas toleran in the talks within the Party.
To hulínský would not gusta that he llamen hulda, but the newspaper aktuálně.cz discovered even other apodos for this president praguense.
"The doctor of the rights of the porras" according recuerda seems that Petr hulínský got his Ph.D. in law in the Academy of policía of Bratislava.

Women seen as brujas in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They tend to have a great age, cannot work, for example, for reasons of health, están solteras and not tienen children.
Women who were "vuelven" brujas is envían to an area that perjudiquen isolated, not to the rest of the people.

Accusations of brujería also are common in other African countries.
In gana country neighbor, Burkina Faso, of the week died ammy hemmah, 72 three years, when the two men and women torturaron, the cubrieron gasoline and quemaron.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a unhappy cúmulo circumstances.
According to his version, the woman is prendió in the oil that used for the unciones rituals.
It prendió on fire when the group "he wanted to expel the bad espíritus" of the woman.
The isolation of the "brujas support it" people of all educational levels.
The periódico Der standard cited a empresario of 42 years of Burkina Faso: "the devoradores of human almas always represented a danger,".
While in Burkina Faso the government tries to appease the Gambia, spy-hunting way in the last year it still participated in the president.

"to ayudarle brought to chamanes of the close that Guinea, protected by policemen, military and the president's personal escolta, llevaron to force to men and women escogidos aleatoriamente among peoples to gambianos ownership of President in kanilai," señala in its report the amnesty international organization.
In the would, people arrested had to beberse a pócima of herbs with effects that alucinógenos, moreover, they caused problems intestinales and renales.
Two of the arrested the sobrevivieron not stay in the would.
After the international pressure, finally liberaron to around thousand people detenidas.
The inquilino of bakala: calienta with estufas coal and firma a higher alquiler
The man, old and recio, crossed the doors of the center of attention to the cliente of the empresa rpg byty of "magnate coal" zdeňek bakala, the largest private propietario of housing in rental housing in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm flew a few documents with the new contracts of alquiler of three pisos: yours, the of his daughter, and the of his son, which is cumpliendo sentencia.
The three them just pillar liberalization of the alquileres.
Instead of 3.500 coronas Czech per month, the son pagará from the next year 4.100 coronas by a bottom of two separate estancias with cocina of second rate.
Moreover, "not dispone of hot water, and heating is based on a caldera solid fuel," muestra with the finger the man in the new deal on his son, whose firm tiene full powers.
"But," it firmé explica East enfadado, East resigned.
The Association civil bytyokd.cz, which calificó Las new condiciones of alquiler as "and" incorrectas indecentes, recomienda to the inquilinos that no firmen Los new contratos and that of the esperen hasta 7 diciembre, they publicará fecha in a guía informando sobre how proceder in these casos.
But, in the face of this, as the man solo makes a ademán.
"each one thing," says dice with bad cara.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratorio of evidence of liberalization.
After the new year will occur with the great majority of the pisos that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a alquiler regulated.
Why, aktuálně.cz is decided to visit the "laboratory in person."
The waiting room mining of rpg is one of the four of Ostrava, and the martes to the nueve, was already full.
Justo along the door are the guardias security and their side, a machine to coger number.
"rental housing 2011," can be read in a botón shining of its táctil screen.
By pulsarlo, comes out of the machine a papelito with a number.
Almost shows no time or to read "and" 157 already the number appears in the Great pantalla situated at the top of the room.
In a second, estáis in the tail.
Soon after, there is a marriage of old to ask, but the mob of the room is not here for the new alquileres.
Most people comes to solve problems, as usual antiguamente: applications of bargains, questions of the seguro and similar issues.
The cards with the new contracts rental housing will arrive in Ostrava to the buzones of the inquilinos of the majority of the 44.000 pisos ethnic rpg around the middle of November.
Rpg byty them in the cards proposes an increase of alquiler of between the 15 and the 38%.
The 18 of November, making its ventanilla a special in the center of attention to the customer for the new alquileres.
"lleva operate a week, so that is empezando," responden, after brevemente doubt, the workers who are in it when the customer is presented as being journalist.
Liberalization and the old pisos for mineros of bakala are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the election, already trató high and clear the vice-president of the parliament, originario of Ostrava, lubomír zaorálek, of the čssd, and now aparecen continuously in newspapers of the area.
"twentieth years later quiero a new ground."
"I neither changed the maldito Plato's baño," is the man in desahoga mentioned before the introducción.
According to workers, for the moment vienen more than nada retired to determine whether a reciben descuento in the alquiler if firman in time, as promete the supply of special rpg.
Similarly recibirán half of the alquiler discount on February of the remaining inquilinos that sign the new contrato before the 15 of December.
Nevertheless, the ventanilla of the "more" mining without doubt not logra dispel the flood of doubt.
"of the 230 customers that spent here yesterday, just preguntaron by the alquiler in 2011 around cuarenta or 50 people," estima the empleada of the ventanilla.
Meanwhile, rpg propone on the Web and in their tablones perform meetings about individual contracts when necessary.
If the two sides not reach an agreement on the alquiler, he must solve the issue an independent judge.
"This is not a threat, but of information about the only mode of proceder possible and completely according to the law," advierte rpg in their pages.
"This is not about to try to" nobody opina, one of the empleadas of rpg byty and a man who finds itself in the street against the center of attention to the customer gives, at least in part, the reason.
"I have a pensión of 13.000 and I remain 5,000 for food; I have no means to favor courts," says.
But, immediately, the empleada siembra doubt.
"already arrive."
"Mr. zaorálek them avisa in the media that not firmen, so that people may espere," opina.
The regulation of the rental housing will no longer exist in most of the Czech Republic to early 2011, and, according to rpg byty, increase its economic is a necessity.
"the current alquileres still not cubren even the cuantías necessary for the maintenance of the Fund of the community," recuerda Pavel klimeš, director of the cartera residential of the empresa rpg byty, which añade that the state of the Fund's descuidado community that enfada to the inquilinos is, for homeowners, the main reason to increase the alquiler.
While during the five years transcurrieron between 2005 and 2010 could rpg with the alquileres invest in flats four billion, in the four years that irán 2011 to the 2014 figure aumentará to 5.200 million.
The great pantalla hanging of the ceiling, in the face of the asientos waiting room, now repite some data stand out in Red.
"the rise of rental housing in the 15% a year in 2011 and is the least aplica to 31.200 apartamentos, i.e., more than 90% of the properties of rpg."
Moreover, "always will be as máximo 7,50 coronas checas mensuales by metro," cuadrado se indica by la pantalla.
Alone increase in a 38% of the alquiler 400 floors of the portfolio of rpg.
"in such cases, it is a increase from a amounts of extremely low, 19,66 coronas per cuadrado metro, indica rpg."
In 2.600 pisos, the alquiler permanecerá invariable next year.
Rpg byty promises that liberalization will not touch of coup to the alquileres, but that is escalará between four to eight years.
Moreover, the next adds commitment: the company invertirá around the money of the rise in the consulte rental housing (the gráfico) of new in the pisos, mainly in savings in heating: new window frames and heat.
They will have priority people that sign the agreement subida rental housing.
The architects understood that the offices also necesitan guardería
The edificio administrative avriopoint in brno is the new vessel of the company arch.design.
No one would say that esconde also inside a small guardería with all the same to such facilities: paredes color, muebles creative, and even a park in miniatura in the terraza foreign.
Since octubre of last year, they can go to it the children of the employees of arch.design.
The company projects arquitectónicos arch.design, of cuyo estudio salieron numerosos edificios conocidos de brno, he thought desde the primeros bocetos edifice of avriopoint in incluir UN espacio for its miniguardería.
In the company of work around 90 people, mainly in the age of the baby boom and they wanted to allow the arquitectas and delineantes could return soon after the maternidad to work.
Together with the possibility of enjoy a horario reduced, the guardería is one of the benefits that ofrece arch.design a sus trabajadores on the Marco of your programa social.
The constructoras and arquitectas of this way have the chance to combine a profession teeth with the care of the children.
The idea of a miniguardería was the own empleados of arch.designu and, in the apoyo of the dirección, lograron obtener financiación de unión y of the European ministerio of work and sociales affairs.
The miniguardería of the company is financed through the European Social Fund in the framework of the program operating of human resources and employment, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the financing concedida (a hand-out of more than 2,8 million coronas checas) pudieron comprar the equipamiento and, tras two years, contratar personal cualificado and servicios.
When agote financing (two years), the company arch.design tiene the obligación of mantener in the funcionamiento miniguardería with their propios fondos during tres años.
The project's preparation lasted a year, and in the presentation of the application of financing contribuyó the economy empresa rating.
The attention of children is in the hands of staff cualificado; moreover, are present all day for their cuidados a nurse and a professor of the Education Ministry. The guardería currently acoge to children without limit of age, even though most of them has less than three years.
Since it is a "miniguardería," so solo can acoger simultaneously to a maximum of five children, although with the shifts acuden more during the day.
The operation of the guardería is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the guardería, regardless of the hierarchy within the firm.
Although it trata of a teaching and cuidados individual, the contenidos's program of the miniguardería are comparable to the program of preschool attended the usual.
In her children not only juegan, but also a reciben education quality learning: since the basic until the preparation for school, enseñan until English.
Not only has the kind of toys and of Mesa, but also of a computer for children.
The presence of small children in itself enterprise to create an environment amigable and positive.
Parents can go to see their children in any time and evitan to stress the recoger late children's college when is far from its workplace.
So, while parents are more productive work.
It is not surprising that this genere naturally a relationship of loyalty among the worker and its empleador.
Thus, arch.design se sitúa between Las empresas firman that offer a great ventaja to la admisión of nuevos trabajadores: a apoyan the Familia and, in definitiva, this programa reforzó the marketing of staff.
The house of the huesos remains fascinando after 100 years observen the interiores of gaudí.
The roof down seems the lomo of a lagarto prehistórico, the stairs recall the column of a dinosaurio and the balcones seem the opening of a fish open.
So is the house batlló, in Barcelona, of the arquitecto catalán antoni gaudí.
Because of its way similar to a esqueleto, locals the apodaron "the House of huesos."
Their ways orgánicas, their colors llamativos novel, the use of the rock, the shards of azulejos and mosaicos, a fachada reminiscent of the escamas and the omnipresentes líneas suavemente curvadas, all this is Atypical of the secession of antoni gaudí.
The portada of the house is playing with oníricas lines, colores delicados and texturas sacadas of the nature and fauna.
By providing more attention looms, is a certain geometría pace, and an order carefully thought.
For the night, the entire façade of the House looks even more impressive, because that is lighted in such a way that mejore the brightness of the colores.
Serpentea and the torsión forms of the US remains sorprendiendo also inside.
The wood ondulada copia frames of Windows, the barandillas, the adornos of the door, the mirillas and the letreros.
The casa batlló, which is found in the barrio of eixample in the number of the 43 animada calle trade of passeig of grácia, arose from the re-fashioning a house of the year 1877 of arquitecto emilio sala cortés.
Reconstruction lasted two years and the house is completó in the year 1906.
The investor, the industrial josep batlló Rico, initially insisted topple the previous and start edifice of zero, but soon accepted the idea of gaudí to conduct a novel reconstruction and cheaper.
However, the House batlló, formed by various apartamentos, not diseñó antoni gaudí alone.
Colaboró in the design the arquitecto josep Maria jujol.
Indeed, in their planos project's emerged adornos for the apartamento representative of property and the mosaicos used in the fachada.
In the fachada also trabajadores creators and other artists.
The proposals of collaboration in the House batlló was the beginning of the successful jujol of collaboration with gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the House milá and the park güell of gaudí, in which are other pieces of the same.
Because of its organic form, locals shortly after his finalización the apodaron "the House of huesos."
Others, owing to the specific mechanism of opening windows began to llamarla "the House of bostezos."
It also dice that, at the top of the construction, aparece the sword of St. Jorge, pattern of Catalonia.
Other elements of escultóricos construction esconden religious grounds.
Gaudí cast in the House only a system for the era of central calefacción with respiraderos of ventilación and the chimeneas typical.
May prove extraña its inclination of forty, and cinco degrees.
During the gaudí construction, not respetó in absolute normas the construction of the moment and not be stopped influir by them.
Still, the construction permiso got the corresponding from the start, though obviously him in the data indicados about reconstruction scheduled were so that vagos, two years later, to its finalización, the ayuntamiento stayed so impactado with the result that pidió that is corrigiese.
He molestaba, for example, that the construction incluyese columnas even to the acera public.
The trade-off never be realizaron, more well on the contrary: so solo thirteen days after the application of the ayuntamiento, josep batlló requested (and obtuvo) permission to pisos higher lease it the two parts.
In the pisos lower be instaló himself owner.
In the galería of the second piso is encontraba the salón and in the third piso the dormitorios and part of the private apartment.
The plant is low alquiló to a joyería.
The house, of six pisos, is fully atravesada by a escalera that is until the terraza of tejado.
The elements of the reform were to break all the ángulos noses, and líneas, cubriéndolos of muros curvados.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of conexión of space.
The common part can be conectar completely open the doors of the salones and a larger group can be comunicar in this way without problems, without renuncie to privacy necessary for talks more intimate.
The house, with the reconstruction of gaudí, not only gained a new façade, but also a tejado and unusual two pisos additional.
It is similarly impressive how juega gaudí with the light, azulejos white and azules that cover the backwater and domestic tragaluces.
The game with the two colores provides the máximo of light in all the floors of the house.
Was based merely on the principle that reflects the target more luz that the colors dark, for whom the contrary rayos absorb the sun.
Any person can visit the casa batlló, which in the year 2005 was added to the list of patrimonio world of the humanity of UNESCO.
In the first piso of the house is the apartamento espacioso more and more recargado of the accesibles to the public.
Owners decided to open the door to the public in 2002, with the occasion of the 150º anniversary of the birth of the famous creador.
With visits confirmed, or descubrieron, that it is a very beneficioso business and widened visits to the common zone and the buhardilla, including the terraza of tejado.
The price of entry into the monumento is not negligible, reaches the 16,50 €, aunque the estudiantes, the jubilados and Los titulares of the tarjetas turísticas obtienen a 20% of descuento.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entrance of other construcciones of gaudí in the city.
If it wants to enjoy the real ambiente of bed with their towers of lagarto, should quickly become friend of some residente of houses and neighboring visitarle at home.
How escoge cushion the and the somier: women and men look for different things
Nada of a framework for the pomposo bed; what really confiere their quality to a good cama is lying to the surface, i.e., the cushion and the somier.
Above all must complementarse perfectly to adapt to users concrete.
During the election in numerous elementos enter game, including the peso, high-end, state of health and sex of an owner.
It is also important to the kind of Interior in which the sitúa cushion and the somier.
A typical example?
For example, in a cabaña weekend that often do not have heating, must not utilizarse colchones of látex because they "calientan" more slowly.
Moreover, often pesar considerably more than the colchones of poliuretano habitual.
Thus, it is necessary to give the vuelta more frecuentemente.
If it is not airean duly channels of the center and, above, are on a firm foundation, maintain inside the moisture. Even can aparecer moho under.
At the time to choose a bed, also influyen the customs.
Anyone who has gone a long time abroad, often uses a cushion very high with a capa soft, and will have problems to feel good in a more surface low and hard.
"almost all the jugadores hockey that volvieron of the nhl complained that here not dormían as well."
"for their machacados hombros, talones and caderas needed colchones with a capa soft of viscoelástica."
"this kind of colchones is also recomiendan for people with diabetes that tiempo problems of the nervous system, so reciben wrong information of the articulaciones skin and," explica Sylva hadamcziková, which specializes in the mobiliario acolchado.
Many hockey players, like other customers have the time, preferring colchones of viscoelástica.
"Today there are no longer problem, because they have these adecuados tempur and the italianos magniflex, but also the marca Czech tropico."
There is no longer a ser player of the nhl power to appreciate the viscoelástica.
This "miracle" works in a way that is very simple.
Optimiza its rigidez and is in terms of the calor absorbido or adapta to their bodily heat.
Nothing exercises pressure; during the night, not dará vueltas as after a hard party.
Simply duerme, is better.
The viscoelástica also functions as protection against the llagas.
By choose the size of the colchón, añada to his mark the longitud of its feet, i.e., between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or a woman with a up roughly 180 cm will need a bed, between 210 and 220 cm.
The anchura eligibility for a person should be, in a room, double of 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of the habitaciones individual, for example of solteros, recomienda as minimum between 120 and 140 cm.
For a possible visits also is cómoda.
"If not, it can be applied a simple rule to calculate the ancho: by tumbarse mouth above, should have the hands cómodamente encogidas toward the elbow," aconseja the ingeniera helena prokopová, experta of cechu čalouníků to dekoratérů, already has many years ocupándose of the problemática dream of healthy and the ergonomía of mobiliario, worries that enseña specialized in schools.
In the dobles rooms, each needs its own somier and colchón, so that during the purchase needs to prestar attention to combine the occasion of the colchones.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to stage somieres them to different point, which is not always possible in all the beds.
The colchones of foam should have a altura minimal cm models of 14, with muelles within a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centímetro are for the capa that does to the ways and suaviza.
"When tocarlo with the hand or at acomodarse in the cushion, without doubt should not notarse the muelles," advierte helena prokopová.
Each cushion requires a kind of somier determined.
The dormitorios completely acolchados, in which the cushion the base and are like Siamese, have no sense in the dormitorio.
The colchones respiran wrong and cannot be lavar its funda, which is now ago often.
And, given that each night transpiramos between 0,2 and 0,75 L $sudor, está claro that tras unos cinco O seven years the colchón empezará to recordarnos to a gran (and congestionado tamiz).
For this reason, the specialists reject the eslóganes are a life of the colchón of up to 25 years, or even of a guarantee for life.
However, all but has a.
Why, sellers Dan a Council: in the colchones with a ancho of 120 or 140 cm, ocúpese carefully of cleaning and the brainwashing, but the funda better añada a protector of colchón that can be retirar and lavar easily.
Although currently being fabrican fundas of colchones with closure of cremallera throughout its perímetro, so that by abrirlas fall in two parts (something very important for the laundering and the size of the washing machine!), his rigging in models of larger (and by a single person) by lifting the cushion may seem a struggle between a mosca weight and a heavy weight.
In the bed, instead of a somier, has a table firm?
Get ever!
As much for the pensadas that are to be a night visitas them.
However, must do (if not them tienes already) orificios of ventilación in the tabla and must be used with a cushion with muelles in the interior and a altura minimal of 15 cm with the muelles in bolsas (as the German taschenfederkern) and a capa soft.
The colchones of poliuretano must not be misused about such bases.
For the somieres of láminas not articulables and that contengan between 14 and 18 láminas, can be used colchones of látex or colchones sándwich (for example, a combination of látex and fiber of coco), though it is always better a somier with a greater number of láminas 28, or more, in which the láminas of the zone lumbar are reinforced and can be regulated their rigidez.
The somieres of láminas articulables should not be used with a colchón of muelles, because not reacciona to the reclinación.
Besides the adjustment of the rigidity of the láminas, can be utilizar also the protection of shoulders.
This is a special fixation of the láminas that allows press, or even tilt the láminas of such ways that "rodeen perfectly" to the shoulders during the dream.
For the men who have a very hombros anchos, this is something very important.
Even remember them the fabricantes of colchones that, in the "male", began to use a loose zone more precisely around the shoulders.
Also remember women, for which puts a zone more soft around the caderas.
For customers more demanding, there are somieres with structure in Cruz or tablillas with the so-called amortiguación multitorsión.
The pressure is distributed among different points and rebaja tension.
Also must bear in mind that, although the utilice cushion and somier proper, if emplea a bad almohada (large and "mullida"), desaparecerán most of the advantages.
The basic norm is simple: the almohada must hold the head and the esquinas alone can come to the shoulders, to that can be relajar the músculos of the same.
The appropriate size of recommended is 50 X 60 cm something normal, for example in Scandinavia.
By tumbarse aside, the almohada must be at the same nivel (when it combina with the somier with refuerzo shoulders or more for the zone of soft colchón) that the occasion of the shoulders.
The colchones modern have something to do, it seems, with the original colchones rellenos straw.
The manufacturers still utilizando, increasingly often, natural materials or, at least, mezclas.
Indeed, the colchones biological are out of fashion.
Raw materials to base of oil, with which the fabrica espuma of poliuretano, rellenan with aceites natural, for example of ricino or soja.
Indeed, virtually all the fabricantes known employ soy meal.
"biológico, in the case of the colchones, to say that the center is made only materials origin" natural, explica Petr vašíček of the firm tropico plus.
Similarly, natural drugs are used during the manufacture of the funda of the colchones, one of the first aloe Vera.
But it can also be optar by the microcápsulas, which liberan a fresh aroma to bosque or lavanda.
There are similarly differences for men and women.
While men are "refrescan" with extractos vegetales of brisa, to that of the funda colchón will squeeze out the heat and refresque the body, women prefer "calentar" funda.
The extracto of pimiento improves the red blood circulation of the, so that women feel more calidez.
Does the favorites today?
The colchones made of espuma cold, which are more porosos, with a structure of cells adapted, which makes them to be more permeables than those of poliuretano normal and ofrezcan more permeabilidad.
The combination of various strictures of espuma fría and viscoelástica allow make colchones of various areas that they know perfectly Va where the head, the shoulders and talones.
A cushion of good quality him costará seven thousand coronas above.
The desempeñan that a function therapeutic tend to have a VAT lower, because it means that viewed as health.
The first who won this advantage in the Czech Republic was gumotex.
It is complicated save in the colchones and somieres.
Sometimes can be aprobar the offers of the manufacturers or sellers, which sometimes offer colchones two for the price of one.
For example, the brand magniflex offers colchones duofreeze with a espuma with memory memory adherida to the funda for 11.990 coronas.
The second is consigue freely.
The era of the viscoelástica with a structure cell open and a great densidad is inició with the material "cósmico" of tempur.
Inicialmente emerged as material for has, because during the despegues loas astronautas is veían subjected to a huge sobrecarga.
Tempur is ablanda with the heat and endurece with the cold.
Therefore, the human body, cálido, exercises a perfect effect adapta and make their pressure.
Thus, is to avoid ideal that are produced llagas, but also to improve the comodidad during the dream.
The espuma viscoelástica not only is used in the colchones, but also for health products by, for example almohadas that is colocan under legs wide apart and the alivian, as well as its circulation.
Manufacturers national, for example, use the espuma eucatherm C or twinsaver and similares.
Increasingly parents emplean devices seguimiento of people to control their children
The fear for the children lleva to ever more people to think about controlarles by GPS.
The system, for the inicialmente thought follows vehicles, also can follow the movement of people and so contribute, for example, in case as the disappearance of the 12-year-old girl nine years anička janatková.
For the moment the dispositivo has the size of a rough Pandora's cerillas, but soon be reducirá the size of a clock.
To many people gave fear the case of the missing anička and began to report on the available means to protect better to their children.
Even at the expense of invading their privacy.
"all seek to decirnos that is not espiar, but of other means to diminish the chances of a tragedy," regards Petr pilin of the empresa framework weil, one of suppliers of devices follow-up in the Czech market.
Reconozco "that, in particular, casos can be abused by such devices, for example, if you meten in the bolso of someone without its knowledge, but we have not yet topado with such cases."
"The majority of customers really it compran for reasons of security," añade pilin.
In his view, children should always saber for what is the "cajita" and how is used in case of emergency.
The psicóloga child dana bočková warns about the fact that, if the child not simply wants to llevarlo, it tirará.
"Even children smaller muestran great creatividad to lose intencionadamente certain cosas if they want to avoid that controlen."
"before, parents relied enormously in the móviles, but these could be there as easily as the dispositivo of follow-up," says bočková.
In his view, if it is questionable in case of attack such dispositivo is really useful.
"if it is a Secuestro prepared, the author virtually always comprobará if the child lleva some kind of dispositivo electronic that can desvelar its location."
"now is the phone."
According to "is extendiendo the use of the follow-up devices, buscará them, too, since its sale undoubtedly will take place with much publicity."
"in such cases, the perpetrators always go a step by before the police," says the psicóloga.
However, añade that such devices can help in the case of an attack improvisado of a pedófilo.
According to Robert čech empresa monitoring of the DRC, which offers services follow-up for both as vehicles for people, even in case of that, after a attack, destruya immediately the dispositivo of follow-up, their presence can serve as aid.
"can be configurar the dispositivo for the position that envíe regularly after a certain period."
"If it damage, at least will facilitate the position of the last person in question."
"The dispositivos more expensive ASEAN integrated a medidor of prone, so if the person is simply resbala and falls inmóvil, the dispositivo emitirá immediately a warning with the position in question," says čech.
In his view, a service of this kind can obtenerse even with mobile telephones smart with navegación, in which only must instalarse a special software.
The problem of the units of seguimiento today is that for the moment it is gadgetry nowadays with a similar size to a Pandora's cerillas or the teléfonos mobile of lower.
By then, can perderse.
According pilin framework of weil, for this reason are realizando evidence currently with dispositivos that seem a clock digital.
Moreover, "will have the advantage añadida that a possible agresor may not identifique the dispositivo."
"or that it identifique behind some time, which can hacer that the police gane time," añade.
Although the devices follow-up occur in kept the doll or colgando, using the same technology that will continue to be emplea for the follows vehicles.
This is the comprobación of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the navegación usual in the car), combined with the function of a teléfono mobile comunica that the current position.
The army has mechas enough to rodear all chequia reigns but only two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecha to prender explosives.
Already, the last year, the Ministry of Defense añadió to its nuclear arsenal 224 kilometers of mecha.
Thus, existencias 225 have for years.
The problem is that the life of the fuse is useful of two to four years, most.
The army bought the fuse explosives for the stv group, A. S. por cuarenta million coronas.
The General Staff mf dnes responded to defend the purchase of a so enormous amount of mecha saying that soldiers necesitan for the machinations of training 60 kilometers of mecha per year.
According to calculations of the pirotécnicos of the army, with which was put in contact mf dnes decide that are, however, in such a case, should make these maniobras with frequent use of explosivos each year also all the generals, official of high mando, and even secretarias and limpiadoras.
Not querían exentos nor the defense minister alexandr vondr and the captain of the army vlastimil picek.
Only this could be justificar that the army spend as much 60 kilometers of mecha.
Such longitud amounts to 25,000 explosiones.
Although this fuera, the army would have existencias enough for more than ten years.
If the opposite, just as claim experts, for the formación initial of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of mecha, the army tendría with the new compra (even añadiendo consumption of the units of engineers or especiales) existencias enough for the 225 indicados previously.
Soldiers of the brigada of rapid intervention complained personally recently before the minister vondra because say that have barely munición for various weapons, for what was limitan even practices of draft by question of money.
And not hablemos about the lack of domestic clothes.
"yo nor achievement understand that we compren repeatedly such amounts of mecha."
"But is its decision and, indeed, sabrán why act as well."
"for us, the army is a good cliente at which, as enterprise, seek to satisfy" admits, director of the trade stv group, Jan děcký.
The portavoz of the Ministry of Defense Jan pejšek defends the centenas of kilometers of mecha also saying that will have existencias of this "munición" as minimum for ten years.
However, děcký Jan, of stv group, suggests that the mecha so solo has a useful four years of life, and, in the case of the products pirotécnicos for military or police, of two years.
"If you almacena conditions in perfect, can last until four," says one of the soldiers, for the possible criticism of the army, no longer want to give its name.
After the finalización of his life useful, each munición must comprobarse carefully to see if remains fiable and not to perjudicará soldiers.
But these tests are not gratuitas and require an additional investment.
Another argument of ministerio is that, by buying 445 kilometers of mecha, gained a descuento.
"We costaron a 60% less than the request of last year of 244 kilometers," indicates the portavoz pejšek purchases of the center of the Ministry of defense.
Only to compare: annual consumption of mecha of the pirotécnicos of the police, that blur the munición of World War II, or the dejada by the Soviet army, not supera already since years ago the 1,500 meters.
Moreover, the police always calls for only the amount justa to exhaust the munición before that acabe their life be useful.
It decided to for reasons of security for the pirotécnicos, moreover, meanwhile, and can be accomplished rates mecha more modern and reliable.
The ministerio has already clear difficulties to finish tens of thousands of tons of munición of the era of the Warsaw Pact, when the army checoslovaco of doscientas thousand people are preparaba for a campaign in the rin.
According to the pirotécnicos with which habló mf dnes, after a couple of years will produce the next problem with the current: will have to be eliminated hundreds of kilometers of mecha old, which is now comprando "cheap."

The young Czech is emborrachan with fernet and Ron. The beer is no longer so, because ago slowly effect
Fernet, Ron vodka, and even whiskeys good stolen from their parents.
These are the bebidas that they cause end in medical care bebedores with a young age inferior to fifteen years.
Children who just tumbados in the hospital continuously to overcome the resaca are no longer an exception.
This is derives from the experience of doctors find themselves with such cases in the admisiones of pediatría hospital's.
"beber beer, or vino is no longer fashionable, because tardan much in emborracharles."
"now fashion are the bebidas beverages strong," to právo suggests the head of pediatría of hospital hořovice in the center of Bohemia, luděk pelikán.
"When logran cogerle a bottle to his father of the alacena, can be whisky normally, but it is fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of aligera with zumo and that huele not so much, explica."
It also confirma the portavoz of hospital, universitario motol Eva jurinová.
Usually, "is being fernet or Ron."
These are the "bebidas beverages modern, in particular between schoolboys."
"in some cases, use aguardiente that cogieron at home," añade jurinová.
According to the jefe pelikán, are bebedores of trece and fourteen years, which tend to appear in hospitals.
Before hořovice, where is staffed since this year, worked for a decade in the pediatría in motol, where the ambulancias llevaban to young people from areas close.
"a date had to ingresar perhaps four times."
"empezó to the twelve years, when trajeron with 3.5 of alcohol in blood, además of una mezcla with éxtasis," indica the médico's departamento sobre East caso.
"It was in the feria of holešovice in some garden party of dancing."
"What interesante is that to his mother nor sorprendió him that his daughter desapareciese 48 hours," is the sorprende boss.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even its clear tolerance towards the bebida by their children the seen as the main cause of the increased alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts argue that, in the case of children, cannot be hablar propiamente dependence.
"It defines by alcohólico to a person who has a chronic of alcohol dependence from several years ago, with all the fenómenos asociados to the same, which does not occur in children."
"in those that beben alcohol, repeatedly rather is of a social environment or family systematically failed," explains the jefe pelikán.
According to the portavoz jurinová, this year in the clínica pediátrica of motol is hospitalizaron mid until November forty ebrios children.
However, only the statistics show that acuden with a intoxicación serious, and they must remain in the hospital.
The young bebedores that, behind the medical peripatetic recognition, van home with parents or with the police, not cuentan.
Besides the cases in which children simply meet after school and beben aguardiente for pelikán, there are three altibajos estacionales CABE to mention: the day that way, the end of the year, and the end of the tender school.
"in such circumstances, beben by the bad notas or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the vacations."
"in the day of the brujas I've come to see in admisiones up to seven children ebrios at once," añade pelikán.
The bebedores who spend the night in desintoxicación under the supervision of doctors, paradójicamente, have the advantage that the next day, not sufren a terrible resaca at home.
The pain of cabeza matinal, caused by the deshidratación and the lack of glucosa, with the Evita infusion of a suero with glucosa and with the nutrientes that he faltan the body.
"It éstos marched much better because, after the agitated night, levantan well and not them duele nothing."
"only be muestran confusos about where are," says that pelikán, añadiendo, often, patients lose the good humor at least when ven expenses that have brought.
The transfer in ambulancia and the hospitalización in a room for patients serious it cost to a decena of thousands of coronas.
"I have used the cost to menudo as a means of educarles, when in the visit the you directly to children how much has cost its embriaguez and that would have to spend around the summer in a job for young people to ganaras enough to be paid that night," añade pelikán.
The medical insurance, in his view, perhaps as measure regressive, usually devolverle people expenses of treatment, not hace in the case of children beben.
Two l-159 airplanes are for the first time in hands non-market in Spain
Two planes l-159 of a total of five, for which the Ministry of Defense Czech sustituyó the avión casa c-295m, partieron the martes for sevilla, where is the manufacturer of the aeronaves home – EADS.
It is the first time that a dispositivo of this kind is in the hands of someone who is not the Czech army.
For the moment, only estuvieron abroad to perform vuelos of practices or demonstration.
This is the versión biplaza l-159t1, which until the moment usaba the Czech army and still was in a state of fly.
The three jets remaining are the monoplaza l-159.
These are jealously still in aer vodochody and the sale of the intermediario, the empresa omnipol, already was made charge of them the week.
Jan peješk press, of the Department of Defense, suggests that are not yet sabe when retirarán planes physically of vodochody.
"The planes monoplaza l-159, instead, were separated from the planes reparados long ago, without nor aportaciones additional investments by the ministerio."
"The biplaza l-159t1 is intercambiaron in its current state," said to právo pejšek.
Added that the army is not without Queda planes biplaza, as in May 2009 the army firmó with aer vodochody a contract by a cuantía 200 million coronas for the construction of four dispositivos l-159 unnecessary for biplazas.
One of the new jets it already received the army in July, the other is entregará at the end of the year.
According pejšek EADS, committed to the planes that is añadan the equipamiento of some countries allies.
"in the contract be indica clearly that the empresa EADS is that the retira the l-159 jets, and that servirán for practices of pilotos of countries of NATO."
Thus, "depends on how decidir buyer is going to utilizarlos in this framework," says pejšek.
The newspaper hospodářské noviny published time before that, for example, the army Spanish is not interested in the l-159.
The exchange of five l-159 by a avión home and the purchase of three other aircraft by 3.500 million coronas were aprobados last year by the government's Mirek topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense not convocó a licitación for the buying and negoció directly with EADS.
The direction of current defense claims that the exchange promueve export future of l-159 abroad.
The Czech army adquirió to aer 72 aircraft, and so solo uses 24, for what he wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of jet casa possibly comes to have consequences judicial.
The European Commission already denunció the Ministry of Defense Czech to the European Court of Justice because should choose the planes undertaking a licitación European and not poniéndose in contact with a single fabricante.
The army already received three jets home and the last should reach aeropuerto praguense of kbely in 14 days.
A dedo index more largo that the anular suggests a more low risk of developing cancer
The men who have the index more largo that the anular are subject to a lower risk of developing cancer próstata.
This is the conclusion of a surprising estudió published the miércoles in a British Revista about cancer.

"Our results indicate that the longitud relative of dedo may provide a simple proof of the risk of developing cancer próstata, in particular for men with edades of up to 60 years," indicó the coautora of estudio ros eeles, professor of the Institute for research on the cancer at the University of WARWICK.
Therefore, the finger could help determinar what men should someterse to a test of cancer próstata, in particular if this feature is tied to a risk damaging genetic or other factors, such as health problems family, according indica eeles.
During the period 1994 – 2009, pushed the follow-up with a británico counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with cancer, and próstata simultaneously, from 3,000 men healthy.
More than half of the participants in the study had the dedo índica of the right hand more corto that the anular.
The same presentaban likely to suffer cancer próstata that the 19% of those whose fingers were of the same longitud.
In the case of men with a more largo index that the finger anular, this risk is reducía in a 33%; for men with edades inferiores to 60% reduction, reached the 87%.
The relationship between the longitud of the two fingers in question, determined in the period prenatal, reflects different levels of hormonas to that which is exposed the fetus in the matriz.
A lower level of testosterona is corresponde with a more long index.
Prior studies indicated that the types of cancer influye in the development of próstata.
The great genetista checo and former President of the Academy of Sciences, the professor Václav pačes, told čtk knows that the study, but that it is not parece that the relationship between the longitud of fingers burned and cancer can be "demonstrate completely."
The Czech Republic low Snow: are closed the d1 and the d5

The University of helado
In the "gelato university" in preparan heladeros Bologna, are in the best épocas of the year.
The basic course of three days for future heladeros has the maximum afluencia and visitantes around the world.
Where does in reality comes around the helado?
On the gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere elabora the crema according to all the rules of the art of Italian calibrating helados.
The gelataio Saca with a espátula the cream of helado of mostrador, it extiende about the barquillo and it vende.
To know this, needless to go anzola Dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about helados, should not visitar the "gelato university" of the Italian company carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipado at the University of helado with the congeladora in the year 2003, to make the cream of helado of their máquinas fulfill the altos ideals Italian everywhere.
The basic course of three days for future heladeros has the maximum afluencia and visitantes around the world.
There are also more cursos special days of more about the helado of chocolate and practices in the House of heladería itself.
In these times of crisis, some sueñan with a new race professional, others arriesgan in the soft helado vagos their desires.
This time are 40 participants of 19 countries of every continent, from Brazil to Saudi saudí through Hungary.
To jacky, professor of this art of California, he encanta slow the movement of food, and in the future wants to offer a European product quality in the land of helado industrial.
Anke, Berlin, is an adviser of firms and wants to create something itself in some years within a enervante work.
Two young Egyptian sueñan with open a heladería in Cairo.
A man of Malta and another of Brazil want to improve the quality of the helados of its bars, and a ama of home Canadian, viene Julia, because their children encantan them the helados Italian.
The heladero Maestro luciano Ferrari explains the participants subsequently qualities to the ideals of the helado perfect.
Not only is crucial his good gusto, but also its suavidad sedosa and its good consistencia.
Luciano not olvida their training nor the deck of nata house higher national and mainly in the south of the country: the “helado Italian is simply the best, and why every bola has something ” romantic.
The first step to processing seems facilísimo.
Luciano puts down the basic ingredients: leche, nata, leche in dust, sugar, and estabilizadores in a great batidora, which calienta all with a program electronic until 85 degrees and the moment it enfría until four degrees.
Then grifo opens the sale of the machine and a crema basic white pasteurizada, the basis for all kinds of helados dairy.
Suddenly, the professor asks: the cream of helado can elaborarse alone with or without natural elements estabalizador?
How can you take some unleashing the urge to experiment?
Luciano aconseja that is despisten trends of the time.
The habla that of helado “not only ingredients of natural ”, to the best has used estabilizadores, mainly a product natural, probably rubber guar, bean guar.
Of course that can be elaborar helado without estabilizador, only to comprarlo a day, colocarlo in a stock market and the customer morderá a resounding helado of granito.
It permiten certain variations in the basic mass.
It emplean aromas.
As for the ease of helado, the luciano Maestro distinguishes between the ingredients is that the compran in the section of fruta or in the dulces of the supermarket.
Ademas, there is polvos and pastas.
“all suppliers will try to colar ingredients aromatizados in its mercancía ”.
However “must experience once."
Whether it is with sorbetes of fruta with azúcar and frutas fresh.
Or even with the cream of helado of the masa basic white, that will be a crema with eggs and yellow with cacao in dust as a basis for all the possible placeres of chocolate.
Now the participants course can use the heladoras.
Luciano leaves them uncooperative increasingly four different types of helado of vainilla, chocolate, moca and avellana con, or without eggs in the mass basic, with more or less aroma of vainilla or other ingredients natural.
The same realizan also experiment with rates of helado fruta.
That does not rely SEPA better necessarily that has more aroma of tofe or more puré of frutas.
It is not necessary that the helado of avellanas know to nuts, if contiene more avellanas.
The working group elabora the adorado helado of kiwi, which uses more frutas less water, and somewhat less of estabilizador.
First a balanced mezcla highlights the taste of the helado, says luciano.
The calibrating helados is a problem of artimética: the emplea puré of melocotón with much azúcar, rebajar the proportion of sugar of the basic recipe.
For the helado of salt requires a portion of extra sugar.
Luciano Saca a utensilio with which fija the number of sugar of the types of frutas (medición of vinicultor for oechsle in the mosto of uva).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the bill.
Elaborar helado not requires more than the application physical, as before.
Not only the utensilio aid for the elaboración automatic of the mass basic.
There is also a utensilio, in which bate simultaneously mixture of helado and is prepared to enfría temperature under zero.
Despite all, the entire automatización is being left out in the small pasta.
The Brazilian gustavo is mancha to itself and to his fellow themselves with puré of frutas, as if it were a giant miniprimer without control.
“in all the ” courses, says the Maestro luciano,“ is only a matter of time that something so pase. "
Inspectores in a complicated situation
The authority of the European security efsa foods has been infiltrado in the industry that experimenta with plants transgénicas.
Today, this issue it formula the group of experts testbiotech, which is considered a Institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
“seems a theory of conspiracy, but we have not well documented ” Christoph argued, then, director of testbiotech, the miércoles in Munich.
Harry kuiper, the director of the group of experts on efsa of genetically modified plants, and another expert of efsa also are traded since years ago in the ilsi partnership.
The consorcios as Monsanto Nestle Bayer, or it costean.
Kuiper has colaborado substantially in the normas of comprobación of efsa of genetically modified plants, making it clear sitúa in a conflict of interest, critica then.
The provisions of efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentación of the situation of ilsi and imitan the escritura of the company, actually is controlled by their Italian authorities in parma.
It is the second time that testbiotech critica a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of efsa fue without the apoyo nor the time of the transition to suiza agrarkonzern syngenta, and this has changed with its side.
Recently, also mitteldeutsche rundfunk (mdr) unveiled personal connections between the authorities of the inspection of the EU, and the industry, which pushed the oficinal general of the environment, as well as a clarividente parliamentary of the EU.
Nevertheless, efsa may not recognize any conflict of interests.
To be recurre all the data formal, also to some of the industry, provided that Sean of a high and technical quality, ordenan in a report.
Not to be exige the experts who work in efsa that are not no contact with industry.
But these should expose contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the international life sciences Institute (ilsi) in the US.
To be denomina itself as a forum for neutral experts and science, the industry and politics, among others for the risk assessment for biotechnology without the encargo of lobby.
In this issue, expertos independent, then, as critican that is currently being permitan plants transgénicas without investigate the comida for animals, and that is not compruebe the influence of plants genetically modified in the environment.
“we want to know what, for example, ago maize have doubled genetically modified in agriculture, then ” says.
The current practice consists in check unicamente proteinas isolated, but not the entire transgénica plant, which does not offer reliable results.
“if it is not buscan risks, how are to find? ”, pregunta, acusador, then.
Angelina hilbeck speaks in the same way.
The científica investiga since 1994 the field of genetic engineering and currently engaged in the technical Institute of Zurich.
In this field, industry intenta increasingly, in the US and in Europe, influenciar O desacreditar to Los científicos critics.
So, there are few scientists who not estén influenced by consorcios.
For companies, studies critics are not publican by general rule.
“industry controls the research of security," mantiene hilbeck.
The rastro of stone
Uli gsell has gained some, in total about 400 kilograms.
On Monday he was to the station stuttgart, with the tuba to its back.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
History is known: in September came the excavadoras and began to overturn a great political trozo of the North.
The land of stuttgart never returned to be the same: thousands and thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As was precintado, most of the Ala is hizó rubble.
Rota in 6.000, 7,000 pieces.

As once said, has olido of the smoke cigarettes.
Still sabe what will not with the trozos.
Stone have time.
Uli gsell also.
The rastro of the piedras of stuttgart leads to a forest in TUBINGEN in a previous repository of the French municiones navy, where Manuel rongen erigió its piedra stein-reich.
The man of deals with piedras 44 years old.
Has bought everything that resulte of the demolición in stuttgart.
“would deshonra, molerían the gravilla or enviarían the basurero ”, afirma in his office, a casita wooden that once was a caseta of guard.
He insultaron and amenazaron, explica, when, in September, appeared in newspapers, which had comprado the spoils of political North to the company derribos.
The habló with the enemies of the 21s for several days.
And they explicó that could not make absolutely nothing for the derribo.
And when sucedió, then was the most reasonable, when stone continued usándose.
Roughly 200 enemies of the s21 took the mazizo of 80 kilos barred, with a price for trozo of 6,50 to 14 euros.
Some as it tomaron memory, but also with the hope of power in a devolverlo reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 toneladas, a burden of 25 trucks.
Roughly half is still in the forest, the rest time ago that vendió.
Owned jardines, jardinero paisajista, commissioned of projects.
They arrived everywhere, and what could be llevaron cozy in the maletero and above.
The piedra of stuttgart momentum time ago, which has become “the Wall ” or in the delimitación of kräuterbeeten.
In reality, this “stone is nothing special ”, says rongen.
“if it weren't for the political ” component.
Asciende to its todoterreno, makes a tour by his great reino hectares of 20.

The road crosses the forest.
He points to a montón: arenisca red, a trozo previous of the station Karlsruhe.
And remains.

The antiguamente mazizos belonged to the tribuna of neckarstadion of stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and histories, travertino yellow of the jefatura of policía of stuttgart, granito red of the Church Sankt blasien, toba of hospital of Heilbronner.
What work, what effort, what sudor.
When rongen think in as esculpió before stone and the movió with a simple aparejo and a carreta, feels very devoto.
“would be a scandal, if anything, destruyera ”.
It has not done, rich in absolute immensely wealthy.
But now 14 people dieron that hacer the tratante stones, moreover canteros, a escultor, a herrero, a vidriero and a gardener have been instalado above in the forest.
"trabajamos hard, but it is ” smoothly, says the man who charged with exploit the remains.
Within little has to go to colonia.
There, there are also piedras to rescue.
Struggle of talents around big potenciales
A afluencia Reina active in the buffet.
16 students are agolpan around the panecillos the beans, and the tomato sweets.
The University of braunschweig technical and the manufacturer of cars vokswagen have invited to a taller students of mechanical engineering and diseño.
In a kind of concurso of ideas, they have to talking about the future of the car with workers VW and also learn about all Volkswagen.
Rivalizando and the same way, many companies, as VW, reúnen in a struggle to cuerpo body around the mentes more privileged in colaboraciones with universities.
Their mission: contratar sooner to students with more talento of universities, before entren in the labor market and are hired by others.
And as universities not facilitan publicaciones about the skills of their students, tries to atisbar to talents exceptional in practical projects and captarlos.
The second day of project in technical University of braunscheig, the consortium is gana to the talents.
A señorita Department of staff reparte bolígrafos, gomitas and carpetas with the logo of VW.
Explica to the ilusionados young talents programs of practices and jobs for students and them shows their roads in the consortium.
Nico selle of technical University of braunschweig takes the project with VW.
Ve advantages for both sides: “students enter in contact with the industry and adquieren ” experience.
In turn, “VW can meet students, observing more closely to the candidates interesting and them as posibles future ” workers.
Some collaborations, says selle, are not rare.
The news is that students are deseados so directly.
The key point “previously was in the technical projects," says selle.
The Fight for graduates frescos is being turned hardest.
In many strands, firms can no longer escoger to their employees between a large group of applicants.
If not that have to anunciarse and, above all, to secure a labor highly cualificada.
All students of the disciplines of engineering are in an excellent plight of negotiation.
According to the German association of engineers (vdi by their siglas in German), in October existían 40,000 engineers vacant jobs.
And, according to the prognósticos of the vdi, this vacuum of engineers are to increase by further.
In the company of auditoria and advice, kpmg, Roman dykta deals with spy-hunting talents.
Organiza costly events hiring, as the carrera kpmg, a kind of yincana modern, in which participants have to find its way through the coordinadas's GPS.

Moreover observar participants may subsidiaries of kpmg and learn about the company.
They decide who must go in two rondas of choice in the exit.
Only the crème of the crème of many participants is going to the US.
Universities are esfuerzan increasingly in escoger and pulir to high potential of universities, according dykta.
“with the race we want to destacar of the mass ”.
The “trayecto simple by itself solo we are quedaba short."
For the cazatalentos dykta the notas delivers results.
“until today we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
“some are close to its end, and want solicitar work with us," says.
In addition to the acercamiento direct in the campus, are also to the caza, above all, small- and medium-sized businesses, classical with their ferias of work.
“seek to obtain students in the ferias specialized ”.
“something about intersolar ”, says sitha stübe, development of staff for the manufacturer of solar technology solarworld.
The empresa Bonner has roughly 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problemática of the new generation.
Today in the página web of the company aparecen 35 vacant seats.
“is being very complicated rellenar the ” vacant seats.
It is hard “long time and money ”, afirma.
A road is more short contact with professors of university.

In the pursuit of a job, the money is no longer what matters most.
The deciding factors are horarios work flexible, assistance to children or a good chance of emerging.
According to a study of the great place to work instituts, solarworld has the Plaza 55 among the best empleadores 100 of Germany.
The Institute elabora annual a list of the best providers of German employment.

In the jerga sector's is called employer branding domestic, also promotion of identity corporate within the plantilla itself.
A few “empleados satisfied are the best embajadores ”.
When it comes to the people and well identifican it with the company, then you consigue promotion directly for the employer by friends and known.
“is like a game with pandilla ”, says kriegler.

Ogonilandia is wrecked
Water is the Ríos márrón oil, huele as a gasolinera: millions of litros vertidos of crude have shattered nature in the nigeriana ogonilandia.
The people's lives theft, corruption, and trade illegal oil.
He appears to celestine akpobari well.
“shall not canséis ”, tranquiliza the activista environmental journalists:“ now it will be enough oil to your eyes ”.
The nigeriano of 37 years has been able to fotografiar chicos vadeando in water until the pecho with the brightness of the luces portrayed in turbulencias in the surface: with the colorido brillo water, the scene seems almost bonita.
That is not ve on the surface flotan manchas Brown of oil.
Here before their shrimp caught to puñados, explica Esther badom on the edge of the river bodo-jetty.
Meanwhile, the floodwaters fluidas are fully stillborn.
Five years ago was vertió in the formidable humedal impressive a number of oil for a tubería rota.
Fish of around the small town of bodo had to nadar six horas to reach waters stuffed with fish: that, in the heart of the Niger delta and situated in ogonilandia, is seen as one of the most apestadas regions of the world.
In the way of the recorrido river that pasa by manglares, the sprawling desolación is obvious.
Instead of water clear, the engine of the ship remueve a caldo marrón, who sumerja its hand in the water, sacará a few rich oil.
The raices of the árboles of mangroves is elevan since the soil, as dark palos of regaliz, sadly aislan the palmeras that chocan and cuelgan their palmas.
In vain be buscan bandadas of pájaros, as their in the humedal as always: in calla as the barrier from abroad, it is expande in a kind of calma fantasmal of a paradise previous with olor to gasolinera.
What happens “here is a struggle ecological ”, claims, huraño, celestine akpobari.“ live in constant danger for the health ”.
The war procede comparison.
The zone of asentamiento of the Ogoni is a reñido Campo battlefield since years ago: here irrumpieron more than 60 years ago the first exploradores European, here is the first organizó resistance in the 1980's with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to put its first factory the consorcio Shell in 1993, because sería too dangerous for employees oil.
Yet today is prohibited the return of firms to ogonilandia: while bombeaban daily more than two million barrels of black gold of all the delta region, a size of three times that Switzerland, with more than 5.000 sources of cracking and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the petrolíferos fields in ogonilandia were tranquilos, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred sobresalían plataformas meters of steel as estrafalarias esculturas water: “arbolitos Christmas ” llamaron cariñosamente to the heads of the perforadoras.
They have to 50 years, the majority corrosión present a total.
At every turn a cabezal fail, opina akpobari, then mana a constant chorro of oil in the water.
According to the valoraciones of experts, are voiced on both sides to more than two billion litros in 50 years in the Delta ecosystem: year after year, the number of oil penetra, as in the averia of buque “Exxon Valdez ” 21 years ago in the sea of Alaska, one of the greatest catástrofes ecólogicas of the history of mankind.
Who is responsible for the lasting región environmental, lidiará with it.
While the consortium of Shell and the robos organized oil are responsible for more than 90% of pollution, the ecologists see the cabezales on the verge of romperse and pipeline with fugas as the main causantes.
In Nigeria, Shell aplica mainly bajos normally standards of security in the world, the conventional reprochó the scientific Richard steiner the consortium in 2008: only the rates of defectos of the tuberías are “on a múltiplo greater than in another place."
In a place that seems far, since forgotten, aparece taller a full of oil under the cielo free, surgen figures among the manglares: están desnudos and cubiertos of oil.
Between one of the many barriles, that sometimes are bound to the perforaciones, sometimes esparcidos arbitrariamente on the ground, flamea a fire: a small refinería illegal.
In a barrel, oil was calienta in the fire, more horas explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetra through the pipeline in the recipiente later, the tubería of oil and gotea finalemente goes diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees to produce daily four barriles of diésel 300 litros: “brings us 34.000 naira", around $22.
The inhabitants of the Delta take advantage of the scarcity of fuel in one of the biggest states petrolíferos of black Africa.
Nigeria alone possesses a single refineria.
With the absurd and inexpensive price of diesel barely 40 euros-céntimo by the litro calentadores illegal can offer even less so reducen: the value of their commodity.
Proviene of the “of the ” bunkers, which trucaron the network of pipelines that crosses ogonilandia: experts, according to this step are lost at least 16 millions of litros oil per day around the Niger Delta.
Only a part of the material negligible premium interim be stored refina clearly illegal way: the redes criminal organized, which also pertenecen political and military depend cargos high, the best part in aljibes cheap and sell it in the world market.
The activist akpobari regards purely académico the debate about whether the environmental catastrophe is due more well at handling of the population or the floja way of production.
"If the petroleras is not comportaran as invasoras and had not completely destroyed the hábitat natural of fish, would not have sabotaje, nor robos, nor refinerias illegal."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are wrecked above all by Shell, to the point that only appears a subtraction from consortium: “perhaps is better presenting another nationality, as the China."
Michael is nervous.
“already will remain in that desaparezcáis ”, says the musculoso ölmann.
“soldiers can come in any ” minute.
If the unity of the special army coge to the refinadores illegal, not amenaza them with arrestarlos, if not with a painful soborno.
Soldiers from the North also want, as all Nigerians, profit from the commodity.
This “doomed invento has made up entirely to our country ”, says akpobari.

The encaja Gore in the cine art?
The director Nicolas winding refn go back to explore the borders of gender with its epopeya of battles “walhalla rising ”.
How will the Danish public thought director Nicolas winding refn by rodar “walhalla rising ”?
A guerrero vikingo preso with a single ojo (mads mikkelsen) are Libera of their torturers and asesina to their enemies with fighting almost sobrehumanas, suena ideal for young bystanders who seek action bloody, precisely because our hero him gusta employing methods brutal to kill and arrancar to their enemies of the tripas their bodies with life when is bad mood.
On the other hand, unojo, as was llama in reality, not dice almost no word throughout the film and the other characters was they get by as much una or two phrases or a couple of penosos gritos killer.
Otherwise be callan and gozan of the bonitos and terroríficos paisajes montuosos of Scotland, which the bastidores offer to the world vikingo of roughly thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for cineastas gather and interested in the existencialismo and movements of very calmados chamber.
When a movie has several groups of destinatarios is not a penalty that can be descartar each other.
The director winding refn regards to their salvajes and the trilogía about the peinado traficante drug “pusher ” as a kind of versión Danish of quentin tarantino remade, but refuses to make their construction Sean for all the public with just over humor in the grain main or something less of brutalidad house artistic.
A mass brain and a tripas that brotan cannot disuadir to most of the followers of the cine art.
Most of the fans of the action is mueren of aburrimiento, if unojo catches a boat to Jerusalem with a tropa of misioneros cristioneros violent by interpretables motives and Queda atascado a time in the calm and the niebla before his team arrives in America and again callarse there.
It is a great pity that “walhalla rising ” has not found distribuidora movie in Germany and solo is publique in DVD.
It is a calamity against the magníficas pictures, but also because, after the presuntuosa and bloody façade, is lurking a worthless piece of filmmakers sometimes excitante, something that merits of attention.
This movie not tries of diálogos or a logical action, all is atmósfera, a sueño fevered transformed in film.
And why there is no escapatoria for viewers.
Refn is condede only a momento of relajación and their images glaciers and the dismal Banda sonora of trance will make a noose in its gorge at, above all, the incredible odio that, since the hearts of characters goes to it.
Only a small joven rubio, supporting unojo faithfully retains, something like innocence, all the others are poseídos by anger.
Above all, the hero of a single ojo, whose motives are not explican never, convierte at any time in a guerrero minted hell for enemigos and aliados interim, possibly in the same ambassador of the devil.
The represents the undoing, but perhaps only for those that are perdidos anyway.
“walhalla rising ” is a film mysterious that can be odiar and admirar, to enfadarse, alterarse and be surprised.
A experience.
Mysterious movements of land
The organization of nuclear energy IAEA has new hints of a nuclear program secret in Syria.
The country rechaza a say about this issue until they permitan controls.
Above the average of 5 night at 6 of September 2007, at least four aviones Israeli combat f-15 R attacked a mysterious edifice cubic in Syria.
Is at the edge of éufrates; the largest city and closer to 30 kilometers, is dair as-saur.
His name appears in the documents authority (internacional of atomic energy (IAEA), treats on a reactor that apparently the Syrians construyeron with help from North Korea in the bucket, escondido in a Valle that travels River.
According to the information intelligence service international us from the CIA of finales of abril of 2008, are diseño reactor current UN under the name of the proximidades of el-kibar muy apropiado for production plutonio, with El that is construyen the armas nuclear.
Instead, the technique barely serves for other than for the ends of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation in with video images of satélite borrosas.
Mostraron with a animación by computer where they were the components of the reactor before the destruction, who was a copy of the North Korean reduced model of the central at Yongbyon nuclear of.
Moreover mostraban photographs were taught that the building since the proximidades or from the interior.
Hacía little time that the reactor was in operation, he says, but not yet was equipped with barras fuel.
Today, three years more afternoon of bombing, es just more known that by that time, the enigmas became mayores with the time.
The previous chairman of the US, George W. Bush desveló recently in his memorias que earlier for ataque la CIA estaba totalmente seguro of that the sirios habían construido UN reactor in el-kibar, but that apenas vio indicios to that in El existiera país "a programa of weapons nucleares."
In Europe, several agents of secret service prefer to be even more prudent and only talk of a “course reactor ”, although consider“ plausible ” the presentation of the CIA.
They are solid evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
When he preguntó what was ahead seguro that have a reactor, a high diplomático of NU responded in the summer of lapidaria way that the IAEA has “material enough to have ” questions.
The Syrians are deshicieron with much of the rapidez escombros of the purported “edificio military inutilizado ” and allanaron the ground to conscience.
Nevertheless, in June 2008 a team of the IAEA under the command of the previous Chief Inspector Olli heinonen found rastos uranium in el-kibar, which had been fabricado by people.
Moreover, the IAEA won by images satellite on a member state, of vendedores fair trade in the moments after the attack, which should have a greater informativo value of the presentó that the CIA.
However, these photographs not llegaron to market, because a cliente unknown, perhaps Israel, the compró exclusive manner.
Why the IAEA cannot verificar their authenticity independently.
Syria always gave implies that never had a nuclear program secrecy nor built no reactor.
The uranio come from weapons Israeli, explained damaskus.
The IAEA it rejected it as inverosímil after the analysis of the particles.
Since then damaskus refuses to discuss here, as modo that respect to the satellite imagery.
Moreover, the controladores them prohíbe a second inspección in el-kibar and entry to the ruins of the edificio bombardeado.
Israel also holds a strict silence.
“it never comentaremos ”, Ehud Olmert, Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not dado results since June 2008 and “be transforma progressively in a serious problem of credibility for authorities ”, as a diplomático Western of high cargo is corresponde with a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally pendiente is a serious infracción against the Treaty of nonproliferation of atomic weapons, for which vela the IAEA.
The IAEA regards three equipos more as the key to progress in the esclarecimiento, which must be “in conexión functioning" with the purported reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not taken released publicly until the moment of what is tratan teams, or what tienen functions, or if seem suspect.
According to the newspaper süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designado as interno to marj as-sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah, of new derivado of the vicinity of cities situadas.
The independent Institute for science and international security in Washington (isis) identified these places and localizó a complex of buildings near masyaf with images satellite, that likely it is one of the objetos suspect.
Possibly lies in or inmediatamente side of a military base, Syria bans with this reason entry to the three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians a registro fear that the US has solicitado to the oiea espiar plantas to the military.
The detectives nuclear estuvieron alert on teams thanks to the warnings of secret service of the US.
Mediante fotografías satellite, the IAEA has indications that is traslada material between the three places, and the bucket to the edge of éufrates.
A Western diplomat with a high office in Vienna claimed that at least one of the teams can be "related to the production of fuel."
But there is no “no indication of sensitive ” activities, nor of uranium enrichment, or reacondicionamiento; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The kind of reactor be acciona with that is not enriched uranium.
Where should come from the uranio and where must separarse subsequently the plutonio for bombs, for these questions central there is, at best, suposiciones plausible.
Nor is there doubt about whether the ruins, the valiosas pistas that can be encuentran recuperarse, in the three places.
As the desaparecieron hundred of has of the truck soil, no one has permanecen information about where the rubble.
The oiae considered unlikely the mina of salt al-tibni, situated in the few kilometers from el-kibar to the other part of the éufrates, that the Syrians reconocieron in 1998 for their fitness as zone for residuos radioactive.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous of the IAEA inspector, the relacionó with the reactor in an analysis of images satellite for the prestigious journal Jane's intelligence review.
But the pictures from the orbit show that the Syrians efectuaron movements of land in the three assumptions lugares suspicious and removed large contenedores after the IAEA solicitara entry.
Can be chance, but only contributes to dispel the suspicion.
Moreover, in the diplomatic sector is said that the IAEA has empleado some months to develop a plan of inspections there, that the Syrians permitieran, to maintain the possible secreto military, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, damaskus criticizes also this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago tranquilizaron with the reactor that was already destroyed, why not the issue has many urgency, since a couple of months ago, Glyn Davies, a kind of US ambassador esgrime the llamadas inspection excepcionales, uno of means more than rigurosos Las autoridades nuclear vienesas need to settle the controles.
Yukiya amano, the director of the IAEA, which must proponer these inspections, has hablado of “an option to which estoy open in the future ”, but still falters.
This path is very risky: for this is needed most of the Council of gobernación of the IAEA, and some of the countries represented 35 there are not exactly ansiosos by escalation.
On the other hand, as reflexionó a diplomatic: “and what happens if not at the end encuentran nothing?"
The love in times of War
There are problems since Angelina Jolie comenzó in summer with the direction of its debut still without name.
Ella itself has written the guión, a history of love between a Bosnia and a serbio.
The jury is much more about it, but this is good enough for the turmoil.
The rumor is very persistente, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with its violador Serbian during the war of Yugoslavia.
Associations of women bosnias have protested quickly, with which in the last moment trasladaron some days of rodaje planned in Sarajevo Hungary.
The film has been rodado in Hungary and in the posproducción, but there is still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira hasecic of the Organization of female victims of the war wrote to the alta comisaria of the UN, UNHCR, by Jolie and applied for a meeting with the actriz, reported to a newspaper, bosnio Jolie is the embajadora of the alta comisaria of the UN for refugees.
It is not diplomática weeks ago, women he was offered a meeting in Hungary that rechazó.
The meeting was place in Bosnia, says hasecic.
Not take stories of love in the fields of rape, and the position of Jolie about delata to the victims enough about the script.
His Organization agreement with the alta comisaria of the UN for refugees has recomendado dismiss Jolie as embajadora, informa the guardian.
But what, exactly, has written Jolie for the escenas?
The Ministry of Bosnian culture that leyó the script, otorgó after a tira and a afloja permission of grabación in Sarajevo, it is not at all clear porqué Jolie was not to the chagrin of all.
The young autora reiterates that not persigue clarity of purpose political with his movie, introduce with much effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of war and give voice to all parties involved.
His contenido remains impreciso.
In the net circula a second sinopsis of the film that suena quite different: the amantes were together before the start of the war and are to be found when it, Bosnia, a Muslim is deportada to a Campo Serbian in which he works as guard.
What sounds considerably different is the victim of variant “rape falls in love with ” torturer.
It is certain that the movie Jolie comienza really before the war.
The pressure on it, afirma Jolie, is “injusta and based on information ” flawed.
Currently can achieve the peace with the hackers Hollywood: while the script follow in the network of illegal way, as many others previously.

The routine democratic
He remains increasing support for democracy in Latin America, as well as the support to private companies.
The biggest concern that generates crime unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is viewed as a country more influential than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest survey conducted in latinobarómetro 18 countries and written solely by the economist.
Given that the poll has been celebrado regularly since 1995, allows a follows the attitude of changes in the region.
In the results of the survey of this year, conducted in early September and October, highlighting two issues related.
The first is the humor relatively bustling entrenched in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes toward democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in various countries of the Pacific coast of South America (consulte the tabla 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached a media of 6% annual since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a small 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Creció also in Mexico, where the economy has been recuperado after suffering a great decline in output last year.
Nevertheless, so solo half of the encuestados of Mexico and Brazil, the two countries of the most populated area, are convinced democrats, which low averages regional consulte the gráfico (2).
Some of 44% of the encuestados in the region will declararon satisfied with the way that works democracy in practice in his country, the same number that last year, but considerably superior to 25% recorded in 2001 gráfico (3).
Some of the 34% claimed that confiaban in Congress of his country and the 45% in his government, the same amount that last year in both cases, but considerably higher in relation to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America, severely therefore hit the support to democracy.
The fact that has mantenido during the global financial crisis will probably be because so many Latin American countries solo were hit by a brief recession and disfrutaron of a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a social safety net stronger has contributed to protect the poorest.
(the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America informó this week that the proportion of latinoamericanos living in conditions of poverty as solo aumento marginalmente in 2009, and that has been reducido of new this year, until the 32%).
However, the mood varies greatly from one country to another consulte the gráfico (4).
The good rendimientos economic of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general feeling of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and have increased the violent crimes.
For a second time since empezaron polls, more surveyed in Latin America mention the crime, instead of unemployment, as the gravest problem to which they confronted with his country (consulte the gráfico 5).
Some of the 31% saying that is them, or a close relative, has been a victim of the delincuencia in the last year, a number that has been reducido since the 38% of last year, and that is the lowest porcentaje recorded since 1995.
The economic rendimientos more positive are reflected in greater support to private companies and the market economy: around the 71% of the encuestados in the region claim that private companies are indispensable for development, while in 2007 so was only the 56% (consulte the gráfico 6).
Some of the 58% in fits that the market economy is the only system that will that his country was developed, against the 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the encuestados in Venezuela opinan the same (and supports the 80% to private companies), though its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropiando numerous private enterprises.
Brazil is the country that shouts a greater leadership in the region, just as indicates the 19% of those polled (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9% cifra itself, that last year), and Venezuela (9% against the 11% a year ago).
However, America is the country considered more influential by the encuestados in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela ostenta such title in Ecuador, the Republic dominicana and Nicaragua.
Elections to the rubbish
No one had hoped that the general elections held the 28 of November in Haiti fuesen perfect.
However, transcurrieron in a manner much worse than is temían foreigners who seek to helping the country to remontar behind its problems.
Were introduced votes in the polls, some people voted several times, papeletas tiradas in the alcantarillas, colegios electoral actos destroyed, and intimidation.
The polls opened with hours of backwardness.
Numerous Haitian groups, including displaced by the January earthquake, vagaban by trying to discover the area where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, is dieron up.
A dozen candidates to presidential ones, including a number of the most populares denounced fraud, and pidieron being cancelled elections.
The protests, some of them violent, extendieron around the country.
Nevertheless, edmond mulet, the United Nations official in senior in Haiti, declared that "elections were relatively good in many ways."
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, with cautela claimed that, "not opinamos that these irregularidades, by serious that are, invaliden necessarily the process."
In other words, the sights continues.
The electoral authority that, according to their contrincantes is committed to René préval unpopular, the outgoing President, and with its candidato, jude célestin, should announce preliminary results December 7.
Projected that the desempate is realizará in January.
Not yet have been lost all the hopes in relation to elections.
The two leading candidates of the opposition, Michel martelly, a rapero, and mirlande manigat, a former first dama, have withdrawn its initial petitions, in which the solicitaban invalidación of the vote.
But still problems may arise if the electoral authority declara that the señor célestin, which has barely support has, if any, has gone to the second round.
Considering that the cholera epidemic arrasa the country, and more than a million of survivors of the earthquake still live in tiendas, is expected a great abstención.
The time, many haitianos wanted to vote, but not managed to do so, owing to a lack of organization.
Some 250,000 documents of identity, needed to vote, still not had distribuido shortly before the elections.
There is much at stake.
Donors aid reckons that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in rebuilding Haiti.
And, according to quedado patente, it has also think the haitianos themselves.
Moving to the center of puntillas
In the weeks since lost to her husband, Cristina Fernández, the of Argentina, has enjoyed a great simpatía between the público that has increased its index of popularity in 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level that has registrado since his election in 2007.
Despite all, that can convertirlo in a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections dependerá if clearly affected señora Fernández does the intransigence of his late marido, his predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indicaciones are not mixed.
The señor Kirchner, which seguía making charge of economic policy even after his wife sucediese him as president, was the habit of forge budgets infravaloraban tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled the marriage presidential spend the additional income to its discretion.
In theory, the government of Mrs. Fernández lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has made after the demise of Kirchner to attack the cause of a heartbeat October 27.
Some members of the discrepantes Peronist movement in power have been with Mrs. Fernández.
However, after a caóticas sesiones in which a member gave a puñetazo to another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the budget of 2011.
"I will not discuss," said the chairwoman.
The budget in 2010, therefore, be aplicará to the next year, which ofrecerá to a margen chairwoman of action still greater to spend it.
The economy is improving considerably: probably grow until a 9% this year.
The rate of inflation official lies in today's 11,1%, pero numerosos cálculos private, además of plants exigencias salariales of the sindicatos, the sitúan cerca of 30%.
The señor Kirchner, who took power in 2003, when Argentina was on the brink of collapse, meant that economic growth and poverty reduction, whatever their priorities, rather than the control of inflation.
Refused to negotiate with the IMF, presionó the private sector and made the indec, the Institute of estadística, adaptase official statistics of inflation.
Does moderará now the presidenta Fernández these policies?
Has convocado meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the trade unions.
Moreover, his officials claim that want to limit wage increases the next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by high prices of agricultural exports argentinas in the world.
However, inflation has limited the boost to growth conseguido with a great devaluation in 2002.
The reason is perhaps by Ms. Fernández is dando signs of wanting to restore financial Argentina's ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government came to an agreement with the titulares of bonds that had to be negado reestructuración forced a prerequisite of debt that Argentina had not abonado in 2001.
Today, it seems that the Ms. Fernández is poised to hold an agreement with governments creditor agrupados in the Paris Club, to which debe around 6.700 billion.
The Kirchner always insistieron in that this does not implicaría supervision of the IMF, as is often unusual.
However, the mes past dear boudou, the Minister of economics, announced that the Fund ofrecerá "technical assistance" to hammer out a new national price at the rate of consumption, which parece the prelude to the cleansing of indec.
Not Queda clear if the presidenta Fernández wants to follow in politics concluded will when his term, keeping in mind that no longer tiene to her husband to its hand.
If it does, will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has been cansado of kirchnerismo.
When Argentines regresen of their vacations estivales in March, the wave of sympathy for it will decaído.
If other wants to win elections, will have to decide whether or not, repudia calm, with many of the policies of her husband.
East China Hurrrah
Taiwan's voters are catching up slowly to a kind of closer union with the continent.
What opina its big brother Taiwan on the other side of the estrecho?
More than 7,5 million voters, the 70% of the elegibles, acudieron 27 of the noviembre to elegir to the alcaldes and concejales than cinco districts urbanos en lo que appears an amplia evaluación's president, Ma Ying-jeou.
The señor own Ma has become a champion of sentiments by the continent, taking shape innovative business ties, including a pact of free trade partial, the biggest changes in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma spent the test, but by little.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) eventually gaining three of the five election to alcaldía, failed to get the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has been inclinado independencia by a total of Taiwan, gained nearly 50% of all the votes against the 45% of KMT.
If they had been presidential ones, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of the votes of his party has declined by around 8%.
For the first time, the ppd empató with the KMT in the ayuntamientos.
In the elections could be seen the typical elements of elections taiwanesas, including ruidosos camiones campaign and large aglomeraciones with banderitas and chicas mild of ropa bailando.
Nor faltó the mysterious attempt of murder of rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, Honorary President of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the candidates of the KMT night before the elections.
A man of the crowd disparó the young directly in the face hiriéndole, and killing a transeúnte.
The curioso is that has not been able to determinar if the man intended, stand damage to take revenge or Lien of candidate.
In any case, says tsai ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the shoot-out hit elections, sembrando suspicions about the ppd and provocando that voters are inclinasen for the KMT.
Perhaps the only great ganador of the campaign was China.
Resultó surprising that is not tratase the issue of the continent in itself.
Instead, the candidates spoke of plans alojamiento public and creation of employment.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detesta the military threat of China.
Thus, the KMT avoiding tends to publicize its ties with the government in pekín.
But this time also avoided the ppd encourage sentiment against China.
Responde to the new awareness that the Chinese trade is essential for the survival of economic Taiwan.
For their part, Mr. Ma claimed that had been confirmado that its policy with respect to China was acceptable for most of the Taiwanese.
Projected that the government continues to pekín sobornándoles with trade, in accordance with its strategy to achieve that Taiwan back to the redil.
China wasted no time told a broker to Taipei to prepare for a summit on the protection of investments and cooperation medical.
Indeed, he would like to get similarly political integration, but the first is the first.
The best will wait to make it through the America 2012 presidential election for this.
In any case, the ppd has reinvented itself.
Two years ago was in a bad situation: his long-time leader, Chen Shui-bian, encarcelado was accused of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, instigaba openly independence explicit.
However, under the leadership of Mrs. tsai has emerged, a new generation of moderate and the ppd is working hard to attract professional and jóvenes.
The tsai Ms. has been acogida gratamente as candidata of the DPP for the presidency, like his tseng-chang, which cumplió mandate under Chen.
His party is now doing everything possible to demonstrate that can also have relations with pekín.
The tsai Ms. plans announced the creation of a group of experts that act as point of contact between China and the ppd, provided that can llevarse conducted negotiations without preconditions.
The tsai Ms. said to the public Taiwanese that his party represents a reliable "alternative" to the precipitado approach of señor Ma with respect to China.
Mr. Chen seems outraged by the change.
In a statement issued since his cell, claimed that the candidates of the DPP had salido better off if they had insistido in that Taiwan is an independent country.
Even ordered the señor his, a pragmático, not to presentase presidential ones.
Even without that interceda Mr. Chen, the ppd difficulties will have to choose between its possible candidates.
The KMT must also do a review of conscience.
The valoraciones Ma's señor have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not querido campaigning with him.
His unpopularity seems to be due primarily to unemployment and the diferencias growing between rich and poor.
A portavoz KMT's claims that reestructurará his cabinet, as well as the local teams.
The big muestras of the DPP suggest that the support of Taiwan to a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese reckons that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "has already been cruzado the point of no return."

A microbio resistant to arsenic raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth -- or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can used the arsénico as one of their nutrients widens the chance to find new ways of life on Earth, and, possibly, in other planets.
Although researchers descubrieron the curious bacterium here in the Earth, showing that it is possible to say that there are ways of life without the main elementos that consideraban essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"can grow is with fósforo or with arsenic."
"that the convierte in something very peculiar, although little falta him to be a kind of form of life really 'alienígena'", comentó Paul C. W. Davies from the Arizona State University, the report coautor who aparece in the edición in line of jueves of the publicación science.
Since long ago, there are large elementos six essential for life: the carbon, hydrogen, the nitrógeno, the oxígeno, the fósforo and the azufre.
However, researchers have found that the bacterium, hallada in mono Squam, California, can keep growing after the fósforo substitute for the arsénico.
"You ago plantearte what more is possible," Ariel D. Anbar de the Arizona State University, coautor of informe.
According to indicated Anbar, the hallazgo is important for the pursuit of living in different planetas of the earth, given that researchers needs power reconocer life, know the aspect that has.
The study focuses on a microbio discovered in the earth.
Nevertheless, the appeal of a waterwheel press to debatirlo, in which is not divulgaron details of, generated a great especulación in Internet about the possibility that the report indicase the discovery of life extraterrestre.
Did not.
What the discovery is "yes shows that in other entornos planetarios, could have bodies that use other elements to boost his or her biochemistry and that the set of elements" standard "we find indispensable for life may not be so fijo," comentó Charles cockell, catedrático of planetary sciences and space research institute, open, Keynes, Milton University in the United Kingdom.
Cockell not formó part of the team of research.
"This work is novel demuestra because the replacement of an element by another in the basic biochemical or her biochemistry and the structure," chirped cockell.
The discovery is not realizó by accident.
Felisa wolfe-simon of the Institute of astrobiología of has, who ran the study, centered in the mono Squam because presenta high levels of arsenic.
The arsénico and the fósforo are similar from the point of view especuló chemical, so that a microbio exposed to both by could substitute for one another.
"The arsénico is tóxico mainly because its behavior chemical is similar to the fósforo."
As a result, "can resultarle complicated to organisms diferenciarlos."
", however, the arsénico is enough to different as that won't work as well as the fósforo, for what entra and put it, for some way, the apelmaza machinery biochemical," explica Anbar.
Researchers picked the bacterias known as gfaj-1 and the expusieron to increasingly higher concentrations of arsenic, to which they achieved adapt and utilizaron to grow.
The microbe crece better with fósforo, but the fact to demonstrate that it can live with arsenic in its place raises the possibility that can exist naturally a form of life that use arsenic, whether in other areas of the earth, or in another planet or luna where the arsénico be more common.
Jamie S. foster, profesora auxiliar in microbiología in the University of Florida, indicó that the proponent of pueda sustituir El arsénico for the fósforo is nueva, but nunca being había encontrado UN ejemplo that demostrase that funciona.
The arsénico was more common in the first eras of the earth, pointed out, so that the first researchers especularon forms of life can have used.
"Yes that suggests that could be other means to generate life, not only in the way that life is formaba formerly on earth," indicó foster, not part of research team of wolfe-simon.
The research was supported by the has, the Department of Energy and the institutos nacionales health.

The lion is ready to rugir again, while the restructuring of mgm buys the final approval of the Court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, mgm has secured finally green light to begin again.

Before the spring of this year, volvió at the table of design as the team of mgm began to work in a plan of restructuring, which, after months of debate and desacuerdos internal, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When mgm officially salga of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, companies and moelis Cooper will bonificaciones multimillonarias for his work.

Tech toys wants to maintain the balance of its budget for free gift
While the ipad is the leading candidate to be the juguete more wonderful of this year, followed by, perhaps, the system of videojuegos Microsoft kinect, both can significar a significant mella in its budget for free gift.
Considere that for the price of a ipad can buy five bicicletas bmx 99 of $each, and a juego kinect costs the same that 10 cuerdas of salto classical adornadas with accounts, or roughly 48 cans of play-doh.
But there are modes of maintaining its budget for free gift in equilibrium.
Recently visité to three vendedores of national toys, Wal-Mart, toys R "us" and bj ''s wholesale club, to see that toys electronic could comprar by less than $80.
Was immediately clear that the law of Moore has been trabajando; the juguete technological of this year probably will have more power, costando the same, and even a poco less compared to the last year.
Moreover, while there is usually less juguetes associated with new Web sites, two of the best-known of this kind, webkinz and club Penguin, have more offers.
And the juguetes driven by fuel-cell botón are growing, as well as the toys with baterías recargables.
Here, there is some recommendations.
(all prices are toys of "R" of US, save that is good otherwise).
The sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13, for $3 years and more) are toy of peluche the size of a cobayo chanting a nota when it aprietan their barrigas.
A apretón is to a nota, and a second apretón begins to setting up a canción.
If you buys more than uno them, cantarán in harmony.
Precaución: once begins to apretar, cannot parar.
For song combined with dancing, dance star Mickey (fisher-price, 60 years, for $2 and more) is the best option.
Taking borrowed of technology elmo live of last year, the muñeco animatrónico of 14 inches plays games of exchange of turno as simóm he says, and can do the moon step, thanks to their innovative pies articulated with ruedas with dispositivo of blockade.
Children who probaron the juguete usaron to Mickey as an instructor of dancing, although their parents complained about the lack of a control of volumen.
If you is a child of the 1980's, can remember to alphie, one of the first juguetes educational computerized telephone-answering.
He has returned (hasbro / playskool, 40, for $3 years and more), with a mochila full of letters of questions designed to convert a trip in a car in session with a cuaderno of exercises of autocorrección ocurrente.
If you receloso is to give his child its phone smart, here econtrará three alternatives independent.
Mobigo of vtech ($60, of 3 to 8 years) is the most barato and the easiest to use, shaping up a teclado qwerty; although the Games not enseñan with as much as the effectiveness leapster Explorer ($70, of 3 to 12 years), is the first to puesta important point of the line leapster, with a new and more screen bright.
No version is compatible with the old cartuchos.

Finally, scrabble flash ($30, hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocs just more grandes that a Pandora's cerillas, each with its own screen's.
The goal is setting up the words colocando blocs in line before the time acabe is formidable; for a contest improvisada of armed of words.
They are increasingly the juguetes that have any kind of connection in line.
Basado only in its presence in jugueterías, the two largest are webkinz and club Penguin.
To purchase to his son in a mascota line in the club Penguin, for example, can bring a club Disney Penguin 2 "mix 'n match figure, pack ($5, of 6 to 12 years) that includes a currency with a code hidden.

Promueve Lado is a more moderate of maintaining the order in China
As a sargento instructor urban, Tang shenbin marked the step in a square the city, inspeccionando with severidad to the nerve to personas office, emitiendo orders voice in low with military authority.
He wanted to that members of female chengguan, the corpulentos police order of urban China, and temidos as lowly valued by their decisive measures caprichosas and its inclination to violence, comunicaran a certain impression to a handful of bystanders.
"get firmes!"
"get beware!"
You muéstrenles, susurró, "How girls are pretty!"
Barely four girls spent adolescence with guantes white and chaquetas green Oliva identical and pantalones indexed to call attention.
Four pares of zapatos black perfectly alineados.
Four sombreros elegant held perfectly above the cabello cling with moños to rayas azules and blancas.
"personally, I believe that they have a apariencia normal," said Mr. Tang, desdeñosamente.
"The models are lindos."
More than a government has tried to clean up the image of inspectors urban of China.
A city ordered that all new reclutas have a title of degree.
The Guangdong province of changed the color of the Green grisáceo uniforms to a azul supposedly more attractive.
In China, wuhan central, replaced the use of force by miradas intimidatorias: in 2009, according to a report, 50 rodearon officers to a wayward carrito of snacks, and with it looked over the ceño fruncido constantly during a hour, until the vendedor peripatetic recogió their things and marchó.
Xindu, a district of urban 680.000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a change of imagen radical.
Since 2003, the district has agregado to its police urban 13 women, elegidas expressly for its appearance, proporción and juventud.
The idea is to give the tosca policía a side softer, female.
Unfortunately, until scarlett johansson would have to fight to increase the ínfimo of China with respect to these escuadrones of the city.
And for a good reason, argumentarían critics.
Unlike the police officers, these are only authorized to enforce ordenanzas of the city, imposing multas and other penas administrative.
But the news media of Chinese retratan routinely a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors Hubei province of killed beaten to a transeúnte after using his cell phone to filmarlos while disolvían a protest against a vertedero of desechos.
Last year, a manual of training for inspectors of pekín was hurtado and published in the Internet, in which it describía as azotar effectively to make them without criminal bleed.
This year, a peripatetic seller of sandías Shanghai suffered brain damage after a riña with five officers.
A game of vídeo full of violence, available to descargar in line, poses inspectores entrenados by the Chinese who struck to vendedores feral.
"chengguan has left a scar in the government," is lamentó China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper "demanded a cleanup really meticulosa."
Skeptics say that the current approach is very far from this.
After the district solicitara through a ad eight new reclutas female in October, an editorial in the Beijing evening news is preguntó if women had deberes real or were simply a distracción escénica.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The warning sign of the district asked female candidates of 18 to 22 years, with a good figura, "and the five traits faciales armoniosos."
Should have a high above the average, superior to 1.6 metros O 5 pies, 2 ½ pulgadas.
The withdrawal to the age of 26 years is compulsory.
Officials have said that the work was physically too arduo for women with more than 25 years.
"his image is the important thing," he told a anonymous district official to rednet.com, a sitio Web cuasi gubernamental.
First, the external "qualities of the candidatas will determine whether cumplen with the requirements, as high-end, peso, rasgos faciales, etc."
Then viene temperament "and the qualities interior."
The chengguan feminine are como floreros, said, "and agregó, moreover, will have to be floreros other responsibilities."
Lihua Zheng, subdirector of the office of management of the city's district, is not eager for support this description.
But observed that the demands of high-end were standards in many avisos of Chinese work for both sexes.
Then there is the demand faciales features of armoniosos.
If this means be apuesto, is a matter of debate between the Chinese.
Surely, the minusválido or desfigurado must not be presented.
"We cannot let a person coja or a jorobado vengan to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"his image not estaría well."
Liu Yi, who patrulla the Plaza baoguang near a monasterio, has 22 years, with their mejillas coloradas mouth and a sutilmente curva.
She don't believe that the ever in its aspect is sexista, dijo.
"Do you believe that parezco sexy with this uniform?" asked with a look sardónica.
His partner working with hoyuelos Xu, Yang of 21 years, he said, "our work must presentar the image of the city."
Nor are they oponen to its work to particular time, said, because abrigan ambiciones career of higher than simply flush out vendors in the callejones where it is assumed that circunscriben their business.
Every morning, the escuadrón faces more or less to a dozen vendedores ambulantes that is lanzan foot or in bicicleta, trying to sell so many panecillos or tazones of tofú as possible before being echados.
"señor Wang, has to go."
"We have dicho it many times!" said the señorita Xu as a seller is escapaba foot, temporarily abandoning its carro flushed down bicicleta with guarniciones of fideos.
Officers describe their responsibilities as more monótonos that agotadores.
"This is more or less lo same every day," said Huang Jing, of 20 years, who estudia marketing in their hours free.
"quite rutinario."
One reason is that the officers feminine lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscar the mercadería of sellers.
Can only amenazar to denounce offenders to their supervisores men.
This tends to protegerlas of the sudden demostraciones of public animosidad against the bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, amotinaron then that is esparciera the false rumor that a few officers chengguan had been killed a seller.
More than a dozen or policemen oficiales chengguan injured in the episode nighttime; 14 vehicles government were volcados or prendidos fire.
For the momento xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm barely is guaranteed.
Only two streets of the apacible Plaza baoguang officers, where female patrullaron this mañana, more than 50 people met in a corner.
Officers confiscado had a motocicleta that was being reparada in just rather than in a taller, as exige the rule-book.
The storeowner moto gritaba groseramente.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before officers, with bad cara, abrieran way to the codazos until their vehicles and fueran quickly with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li xuedong, 40 years, a coordinador allocated to the escuadrón male, remained behind, with its insignia white Dada back to hide his name.
As the female officers, the coordinadores, men of 40 years or more, play a role puramente support.
Unlike them, are not teaches them to maintain an image elegant.
"sometimes fought verbally."
"sometimes luchamos físicamente," said Mr. Li with total naturalidad.
"most of the time is the public that the empieza the scramble."
Prosecutors not levantarán charges against Senator ensign
The lawyers of Senator announced that the miércoles prosecutors Department of Justice have exculpado Senator John ensign of the imputaciones criminal that emerged out of its affair with a former deputy campaign and its efforts to ensure work through lobby for the husband of women.
The decision ends with the legal more serious threat facing ensign, the republicano of Nevada that was viewed as as possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal about his affair had headlines national last year, and dañara his career.
The office of ensign said that "sintió surely contento" by the decision, which llegó then of an investigation of a year.
The senador could still face a measure of ethics committee disciplinary of the Senate.
The lawyers ensign said that the Department of Justice "that we had informado Senator ensign is no longer a goal of their research and that has no plan to lift charges against him for this issue."
The Department of Justice declined to make comments on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many lawyers ethics outside the Department of Justice, who said that seemed to have significant evidence to suggest that ensign could have confabulado to violate prohibición federal lobby on a criminal.
The entrevistas, the emails and other documents that is divulgaron in the first place in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that ensign had to ayudado Douglas HAMPTON, who was one of its AIDS, to obtain work lucrative through lobby, to achieve the silence of HAMPTON and his wife, cynthia, about the affair of Senator with it.
The Ms. HAMPTON once worked as tesorera of a campaign of ensign.
Ensign was in touch with several sponsors political attempts to work to señor HAMPTON and abogó in the name of them after that had contratado the señor HAMPTON do to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As HAMPTON had recently been a Assistant ensign, was excluido according to the law to lobby for their former employer or the Senate for a year.
Experts in ethics said that the unusual settlement between ensign and HAMPTON, which were friends íntimos before the affair, apareció in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict that former government employees using their personal connections to do business.
From the evidence that has been done public, "seemed to be a case of a commodity facie conspiracy to violate the statute substantially revolving door," said Stanley brand, a lawyer Washington that is especializa in defending clientes investigados by the government.
While officials of the Department of Justice rehusaron explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case ensign, Mr. Brandt and other lawyers ethics said that the Department pareció cautious to accept procesamientos political after several important setbacks for its integrity section of public, including the decision of last year to abandon the indictment against the former senador Ted Stevens, in the midst of charges by bad conducta of procedure.
Prosecutors federal "are clearly a few cowards," he said melanie sloan, managing director of the responsibility for citizens, and ethics in Washington, a group of defense that trajo several complaints against ensign in the case.
This means that "basically administration officials higher-ranking now can assume that the law is not aplican to them," chirped.
Paul coggins, the main ensign of a lawyer, said in an interview that received a so-called telephone of a Prosecutor of the Department of Justice and the Monday another so-called more the next day, diciéndole that the department not quería lifting charges against his client.
The team's defense ensign had been cooperando with prosecutors in the tentativa of persuading them that the senador, as his office reiteró in a declaration, "the miércoles acted agree with the law."
Coggins refused to explain the legal argumentos with detail that gave the prosecutors.
"I siento comfortable not entrando in details about my discussions with the Department of Justice alone, I can say that thought that took the decision fair," he said.
Last month, the Commission federal elections decided to change a research in a queja separada by the group of ethics, which alega that a payment of $96,000 of parents of ensign to the HAMPTON violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said that not tenía enough evidence to prove that the money was no more than a regalo.
Nv energy is an important company of Nevada that had apoyado for a long time to Senator, which he got work through lobby thanks to the aid that ensign gave HAMPTON.
A correo electronic envoy in December 2008 showed that after the company to aceptó HAMPTON as lobbista, the chief of staff of ensign, John Lopez, with comunicó HAMPTON and told him that was "machacando" the interior ministry on an issue in dispute.
Ensign also asistió to a almuerzo with HAMPTON, and another cliente of Nevada, allegiant air, and he called the Secretary of transport to establish a meeting in the name of the line air after that had to do contratado HAMPTON to lobby.
For the first aparecieron when the news of the affair last year, ensign him pidió pardon to their voters and renounced its position as a fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After to maintain a low-key for many months ago, two semanas ensign told journalists that planeó postularse to a third term in the Senate.
When the speaker of ensign, Jennifer Cooper, announced that ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, said that the senador expected that the Committee of ethics quickly would follow the example of the Department of Justice and concluyera their research.
"Senator ensign has urge to continue its hard work in the name of the people of Nevada," he said.
The appeal of cheshire Twitter to apuntará
There was a dozen them "chateando" in the ranks of the room's court.
Minute to minute, sent reports of the hideous testimonio via Twitter.
In the end, the dice defense, had more than 140 mensajes of Twitter about the process that addressed the rape and children kept on their beds in a house that was prendida fire.
The jueves widely followed, the process of Steven J. hayes, who fue condenado por asesinato of the three miembros of a family of cheshire, Connecticut, is listo to llegar to an end oficial, with the imposición of juez of the pena of muerte votada by the jurado.
But the lawyers of whatever you say Mr. hayes have presentado writings in the court that delinean arguments of the apelaciones that is likely to ocuparán court for years.
One of the most provocativos claims that the intense informes about the process, including the broad use of Twitter by journalists of mass media of information, created a "atmosphere of circus," and such saturación widespread and immediate with details exaltadores made passions public ejercieran a inapropiada influence on the jurado.
The reclamo could to force the judges of appeal to cope with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the room's court.
According to "what experimenté during this process, I believe that there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the room's Court is affecting the rights of the individual to have a fair process," said Thomas J. ullmann, abogado principal in defense of the señor hayes.
The first instance of juez Jon C. blue, the tribunal graduate state, rechazó lacónicamente the demandas a flaw in the semana pasada, diciendo that the means of noticias were "cuidadosamente controlados" and that were not ninguna prueba que of the Hague jurado been llevado by the pasión.
But probably will not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the appeal of courts have recognized that the coverage of cases celebres can generate questions about the imparcialidad of a process.
In a historic flaw of 1966, the United States Supreme Court revocó condemnation of a osteópata of Cleveland, Dr. Sam sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in the case sheppard vs. Maxwell, which had "una atmósfera of carnaval in the process debido" to the means of communication.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the programa television and the film "the fugitivo."
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeals that examinaron condemnation of the señor hayes half a century later, might feel intrigued by the argument that could be needed new rules to control the form of communication since halls of the tribunal, something inimaginadable in the case of the age of sheppard doctor.
"There is a general motive of concern about the impact of the new media" in processes of high profile, said John J. donohue III, a profesor of the school of leyes of Stanford, which estudió the pena of muerte of Connecticut and writing a informe in the decía is that this fue impuesta arbitrariamente.
The professor donohue said that some judges of appeal might feel intrigued by the idea that limit the communication immediate since halls of the court could make the trials were more justos.
The issue of Twitter is only one of many of the issues delineados by the abogados of hayes, which probably will be disputed for years, retrasando an execution.
The lawyers defense also they claim, for example, that hayes could have been perjudicado when judge blue rehusó allowing them to testearan reactions of the jurados potential, mostrándoles fotografías espeluznantes of the scene of the crime during the selection of the jurado.
Some jurados have said that were horrorizados by the photos of the victims, Jennifer hawke-petit, 48 years, and their daughters, hayley of 17, and michaela of 11.
The lawyers defense cuestionarán also say that the constitucionalidad of the death penalty and sostendrán that the judge incorrectamente removió to a jurado that had criticized the prosecutors, and that incorrectamente had presionado for a verdict by his strange decision to ordenarle at the end of jurado deliberar during a week.
Not serve on juries were abducted.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense cobertura of the process can atraer most of the interest.
They observaron in a recusación the veredicto archivado the mes past that the case dominó the news in Connecticut and was discutido during the election campaign by candidate for governor and the US Senate.
They argued that the media continuously echaban fuel to fuego of the thrill on the case.
"The aglomeración daily Tweets of the media, and the cameras reporters outside the tribunal," escribieron lawyers, "something was never seen here in new haven and perhaps in the entire state."
His attention in the coverage of tweeter is controversial.
In some entrevistas, some journalists said that the story of the fact that they were more important than immediate news reports entregados more slowly, were a vision ludita that haría that the Tribunal's policy on the control of the coverage were weak in future processes.
But some lawyers dijeron that courts of appeal is often sentían lured by arguments about the adaptation that is requería in courts, owing to the social and technological changes.
The lawyers hayes are pushing for this reclamo.
In his writing, refirieron to the decision of 1966 of the corte supreme, which revoca condemnation of the doctor sheppard due to the coverage of the process, and left in clear that exigirían that new media requerirían new rules.
"this case," escribieron, "represents the case sheppard vs. Maxwell of xxi century."
Can civility build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign by the invectiva and the negatividad, this week has desencadenado a bit of civics in Washington.
Is a harbinger of a genuine cooperation bipartisan future or a moment illusionary before a vuelta rapid to combat party in the capital?
The meeting of the martes between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress not produce no progress in the big issues that should be treated during the outgoing session.
But by all accounts, fue at least a polite discussion about the differences of the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern in, to be another episode empty partisan points to win.
The public's miércoles meeting of the Commission's deficit President was equally civilized, despite the policies that subsisten differences between the members.
Parece clear that the interaction close during a period of months generated a respeto mutual that transcends the ideological still gap that separates the members.
This is barely sufficient to declare that has come a new era of cooperation.
Now both sides are in a period of test, sondeándose each other to identify signs of cooperativismo and commitment, while try to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed war party.
Motivo by which the meeting of the martes and subsequent evaluaciones of the same by participants was made with a minimum of demands or charges.
Obama and philosophical differences between the Republicans are too large and are very deeply rooted as to suggest any Cambio rapid climate that existió during the past two years.
That is already sea trate of taxes, expenditures, health care, or social aid, the two sides are in polos opposing.
Nevertheless, the election of November has the suavizado humor in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have cambiado with respect to the way things to say," said pete wehner, an official of the Bush administration now in the center of ética politics and public.
"are inevitable after the elections.
Elections despiertan pasiones party, which then are dying out.
This is good. "
In some issues, particularly those that are contained in the order of the day of the outgoing session, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice to find a solution.
The tax cuts of Bush vencen at the end of the year, and nobody is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve algunas or all the reductions, permanent or temporary.
Likewise, it is likely that there is a commitment to expand subsidies of unemployment, probably because the Republicans can do not believe that they are in favor of the tax cuts for the rich, denying the subsidy of unemployment for unemployed workers.
After the meeting of the martes in the White House, there is greater optimismo by a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of new pacto of nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty (START).
But William Galston, of the institución Brookings, warns that cooperation successful in pressing issues session of the outgoing conducirán not necessarily to a continuing bipartidismo when the new Congress. 112do meet in January.
He claimed, on the contrary, that is very likely to and inevitable, which comience a period of disagreement.
"after that things that must be done to be llevadas after all, short-term psychology revertirá the situation to one of confrontation afirmó."
Also wehner expressed escepticismo (which is widely shared) about the fact that civility can lead to a real cooperation.
"I see the most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the event's main 2012,".
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the house and voters Tea Party, which contributed decisively to its creation.
For more conciencia that have leaders Republicans about the dangers of exaggerating their position, must know that trying to fulfill their promises to cut expenditures of the state and nullify the new law of health.
These líneas party is already observan clearly in Initial reactions to the recommendations of the Commission's deficit, which include the Reforma of the tax code and the rise of some taxes and the retirement age, and the cut expenditures.
The copresidentes Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been encargado of one of the most difficult work in Washington, and, according to its own valuation, introduced to force the issue of the deficit in the order of the day public in a way that cannot be ignorada.
But they need 14 votes in the Commission of 18 members to publish their plan as a recomendación official, and have been struggling to come close to that figure.
The greater resistance is between elected officials in the panel, suggesting that in fiscal issues, there are at least today, little basis, or deseo for the commitment.
Predice Galston two phases in battles among Republicans of the White House and Congress.
The first's next year in the form of shocks advocate, when the Republicans desafíen Obama on the budget, taxes, and then medical assistance, followed by a period of greater co-operation bipartisan.
What would bring the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partidismo of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as happened in 1995, then both parties observarán with attention the reaction of the people.
They see that whoever is losing probably cambiará course and will seek commitment.
However, this can be a vision optimistic.
The partidismo and polarization today are mayores of what eran in the 1990's, and seems to be a hueco ideological largest between Obama and republicanos of the Congress of that had between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans in its moment.
At the same time, activists of both parties 2010 see as the mero preludio to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilismo that is muestra can be welcome this week for many Americans.
But this requerirá much more effort part of both sides to find points in common in the issues that still dividen.
A document American filtrado retrata to Moscow as the paradise of Corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "cleptocracia", and leaves a part of graft and protection of money that recauda directly to the Kremlin informó in February, according to the US Embassy in Russia.
Was reported both the police and the security service federal manage enormous systems of chantaje, which helps explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only of business legitimate, but also of criminal groups organized.
Each estrato of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has termed the "vertical" authority, toma its part as the money sube in the scale.
The note, which was enviada to Washington under the name of John beyrle ambassador, was publicada by Wikileaks Web site in its the miércoles.
The nota is based on whose names sources have been censurados.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov were still mayor of Moscow, and it culpa for much of corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev it despidió in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, yelena baturina, which possesses a major construction company, have negado systematically accusations of corruption, over the years, and he has won several demands for libelo about such charges.
In September, when in a canal television Russian him preguntaron on a documentary film that was that sugería corrupt, afirmó: "It is a madness, a patraña, a fastidio."
According to the polls, Russians creen manner overwhelming that their society is corrupta.
But is unusual find the detalles explicados detalladamente, because estaban in the report of the embassy, and it is inaudito that are diplomats of a foreign country that the hagan that.
"The spots direct government of the Moscow City with the crime have led some to llamarlo 'dysfunctional', and to assert that the government runs more as a cleptocracia that as a government," says the nota.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the world criminal and the mafia which literally means" or "ceiling) traspasa protection that the police service, the Federal seguridad (sfs), the domestic issues (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy's government of the Moscow City.
"analysts identifican a structure of three levels in the world's criminal Moscow."
Luzhkov "is in most ALTO."
"The sfs, and the MVD militia are in the second level."
Finally, "the common criminals and the inspectors corrupt are in the lowest level."
"This is a system in which the ineffectual groups criminal llenan a vacuum in some areas, because the city not proporciona some services."
The report claims that the sfs recauda money of the largest companies, and that the police points to the small comercios.
A source afirmaba, the report, explained that "the dueños trade of Moscow understand that the best thing is to get the protection of the MVD and sfs (instead of groups of organized crime) that they already have not only more weapons, and power resources that criminal groups, but that also are protected by the law."
For this reason, the "protection against criminal gangs more is not a priority."
The nota observes that, while the proceeds of money is complete, protection can be patchy; even the pagan that are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pagan quickly find their businesses closed by a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times on the fight against corruption, but has confessed that has made little progress.
The single reports on the embassy men taking maletas, probably llenas of cash, within the same Kremlin.
"in their struggle against corruption, Medvedev has to confiar in bureaucrats," satarov Georgy, director of the group of experts indem in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"but he is a part of this bureaucracy."
"He not pertenece to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
But politics, without a opposition, without a separation of powers, claimed, corruption is inevitable.
On a national scale, indem estimates that corruption cuesta him to Russia more than 300 billion per year.
In a recent poll on global percepciones of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was clasificado in the post 154 (countries are clasificados less of the more corrupt).
The revelation of the single embajada that the US, not ocurrió until later by the noche hora of Moscow, surely will cause dissatisfied within the Russian government, and despite that Luzhkov can be culpado by the weaknesses of Moscow, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin argumente solucionando that is the problem.
For entrevistado CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the documentos WikiLeaks could be mentiras and furiosamente reacted by a revelación who claimed that it llamaban batman American diplomats and Robin Medvedev.
"The truth of the matter is that this is associated with our interaction, which is an important factor in the domestic policies in this country," claimed.
"But to be honest with you, not sospechamos that this would have done with such arrogance, with such pressure, and you knows, which was done in a manner as immoral."
Veterans of the jemeres red forced to deal with the past
In a débilmente lighted classroom concrete walls, with manchadas and descascaradas, the director of the school secundaria anlong veng reminded the man who had built, the leader of the last jemeres rojos ta mok.
"aquí all aman to ta mok."
"he was a good leader and preocupó for its people," he said sreng KOR Ma, of 42.
Known as "the carnicero" by his brutality during the government of the jemeres red, the commander remains popular in this remote former fortaleza of the jemeres red in northwest of Cambodia, where hospitales built bridges, and other infrastructure, and where still live thousands of former soldados of the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the jemeres red is rindieran loyalty to the government, sustained by a long time is finally desafiada remain in anlong veng.
In April, a local forum for the truth and reconciliation allowed him to the victims that enfrentaran publicly to people who had participado in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a book of texto of escuela secondary that for the first time enseña him the history of the jemeres Red to the offspring of their former soldados.
And in July, a court mixto of the United Nations, and Cambodia emitieron the first condemnation of a former member of the jemeres red sentenciando, the former head of the known center of torture, khek Tuol Sleng Kaing iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the anxiety has grown between the veterans of the jemeres rojos of anlong veng, complicando efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrarse to the camboyana society.
"There is fear and resentment among the former jemeres red, but not can do nothing," argued chhang youk, director of the center of evidence of Cambodia, an independent organization that investiga the regime.
For them, "life under the Reds jemeres was gloriosa, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generando divisions within families."
During the government of the jemeres red of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were ejecutadas or murieron of hunger, disease, or excess of work, estimated 1.7 million people.
When the Vietnamese in 1979 invadieron and derrocaron the government led by Pol Pot, the remains of the regime and its military fled to the frontier of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, launched a insurrection that lasted until the last movement that rindió in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the guerilla war since their bases in the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Western ta mok cultivó followers in anlong veng.
But in the mid-1990's, after a peace agreement UN-sponsored condujera first elections to the country's democratic in 1993, large groups of combatants of the jemeres red began to desertar toward the government, culminando in the rendiciones of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and ta mok, who had resistido, was capturado by forces of the government in 1999 in the mountains dangrek close.
He died in a prison Phnom Penh in 2006 while esperaba the process.
Without the support of their benefactores, the most ancient combatientes of the jemeres red fell in the miseria absolute that is common in the rural Cambodia, and many nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few officials elite of the jemeres red retained its administrative local government in exchange for deposing their weapons, soldiers rasos remain poor farmers and not cualificados.
This "people has won few benefits the surrender of course," sok leang of the Center for justice and the reconciliación, which offers foros public across camboya, even in anlong veng.
"They have incorporada the regime's ideology agrarian utópica."
"ellos were criados without any concept to do business."
Sor Lim, of 55 years, who is to the United jemeres red when I was a teenager in 1974, fought in the selva near anlong veng before to engage in the life as agricultor of rice poor in 1998.
"The life with the jemeres red was well," afirmó.
"ta mok him dio of fodder for all."
"But now life is difficult because we have to autoabastecernos."
The current tribunal of the jemeres red has also caused concerns here.
In the early next year, is expected to the Court begins to prosecute Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan Ieng Sary, and his wife, Ieng thirith, another former Minister of the jemeres red.
The Court's mandate is to prosecute the major leaders, and to those of more responsible for for the crimes, but not has said if perseguirá Moreover cases of these four.
This not servido of much to calm fears in anlong veng.
The recent especulación media has focused on im chaem, of 64 years, who was a head of district in the province of banteay meanchey during the government of the jemeres red in the late 1970's.
In 2007, she told the researchers center of evidence of Cambodia that had supervisado the construction of the presa of trapeang thma, a project in which are thought to have died thousands of workers forced.
During a recent, it bochornosa im chaem returned to work in the camps to his house about pilotes wooden in a way of land on the outskirts of anlong veng.
When the sun arrojó sombras long about the pasto reseco, im chaem rehusó speak of their past in the jemeres red.
She claimed that the tribunal if the convocara is not presentaría.
"is in Cambodia and estable peace,".
"If there is more procesamientos, there will be war."
The Primer Minister Hun Sen, which desertó of the jemeres red in 1978, also has repeatedly warned that instability there will be if the tribunal persigue to more suspects, though experts and historians it cuestionan.
"Cambodia must cavar a hole and sepultar the past" argued.
But deal with the past is precisely what Cambodia must do to move forward, said chhang youk, of the center of evidence.
"reconciliation, according to Khmer, is back together the pedazos rotos afirmó."
"It is our obligation to gather these pedazos rotos so that we can understand."
The center produced the first book of text approved by the government on the jemeres red, called "to history of Democratic Kampuchea," of 75 pages.
It was distributed in anlong veng in June as a suplemento of the libro textbooks history of escuela secondary the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the jemeres red.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of anlong veng knows few details about the jemeres red, despite the link of the city with the regime.
Toque valeak, 19 years, a student in high school anlong veng, said that the new book of text ayudaba students to understand a significant part of its history.
But their parents reaccionaron with skepticism, when the book llevó home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the libro textbooks and the court,".
"ellos have suspicion because they are not sure about the number of people who procesará the tribunal."
It resistance has made the process of reconciliation is complex and difficult, argued sok leang.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to producir an impact, claimed.
Nevertheless, the Red here jemeres retain a encanto powerful.
In the montañas dangrek, with a path demasiadas bad hierbas and cubierto of plastic bags desechadas leads to a rectángulo of hollín black cubierto by a ceiling oxidado of hojalata.
The body of Pol Pot quemado here was a lot about tire after his death in 1998.
Nuom sothea, of 31 years, a seller of celulares to the brink of the road, said that not sabía much about the man who was cremado there.
"But he has a strong and many espíritu Kashmiris go there for rezarle,".
It was the cumpleaños of nuom sothea, and later that day decided to walk until the place of the last descanso of Pol Pot, where he would leave a manojo of plátanos mature with the hope of having good luck.
Belarus accepts renounce their pool of uranium qualified for weaponry
In a victory for the sorpresiva campaign of President Obama to protect the nuclear material around the world, Belarus's government announced the miércoles that renunciará to their pool of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revelado in a joint statement issued after the minister of foreign affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton is reuniera with the Foreign Minister Sergei Belarusian martynov, at the margin of a security summit.
For years, the US government had been trying to persuade Belarus that resign to its uranio highly enriched and seemed that had reached a point of no return the spring.
But American officials him dijeron the Washington Post was a couple of operations clasificadas with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw from 84,82 kg uranio calificado to armamento of a instalación of research bielorrusa.
This preparó the ground for the agreement's miércoles to withdraw the rest of the material, roughly 227 kg, according to an official, which habló since the anonimato due to the confidencialidad of the issue.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the nuclear security summit of 47 nations headed by Obama in April, which excluyó to Belarus.
And by the visto was a good achievement ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I realmente sentí fascinated by the fact that they a place in the nuclear security summit of 2012."
"This shows that this process is funcionando," Ken luongo, President of the society for global security, a group that promotes the nuclear security.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant step and important" taken for Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all the nuclear material vulnerable around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped to six countries to get rid of all its uranio highly enriched.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the nuclear security summit of Obama, Belarusian President, Alexander Lukashenko, the nation never had declared that he would forgo its uranio.
"We have the procedure highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilogramos of what is basically uranium qualified for weaponry) and the uranio of enrichment under" argued, Lukashenko at that time.
"This is our raw -- We are not going to build bombs soiled, and we are not going to vendérselas anyone."
"What usamos with the end of research, is all."
However, Belarus is acercó to the US a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials claimed that the first task to withdraw the uranio of Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated, because the material had been slightly irradiado.
Officials said that was cargado in a special tren that viajó more than 2,000 km to a facility for Russian almacenamiento and disposal.
According to officials, the second effort ended the Monday and was made in plane.
The US government spent 13 million dollars for the tasks, and most of the money was used to suministrarle to Belarus the installation of research with uranium enrichment low, which is not idónea for nuclear weapons.
Andrew bieniawski, an official Department of Energy that works in the reduction of global threat, said that "this was coordinado and orquestado by much careful to strengthen the confidence" that led to the agreement by firmado Clinton.
The James Martin center for nonproliferation studies estimated that this year poseía Belarus at least 40 kilogramos uranium qualified for arms, as well as hundreds of kilogramos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus it to eliminate its Fed toward 2012, according to the joint declaration.
Relations between bielorrusia and the United States have been strained for years, mainly owing to repression of áspera Lukashenko of human rights.
But the declaration of miércoles sugirió a potential distensión.
Were declared that "while acoge fondly progress on these issues of global security, the United States, and Belarus admitted that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue to improve bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish government not put to reparos flights of the CIA
The Spanish government not put to reparos flights of the CIA with prisoners talibanes and Al Qaeda with leadership to Guantánamo by territory Spanish, according expresó in a telegrama the US ambassador in Madrid.
So they reflect the documents (leaked cables) by WikiLeaks the daily the country, where añade that the then vicepresidenta first government, Maria Teresa Fernández de the vega, demanded that the executive Spanish estuviese informed to "power demostrar that ejercían a surveillance appropriate about the aviones foreign that caught Spain."
In June 2006, following a report of the Council of Europe in which acusaba of complicity in practices that are contrary to the human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, came a meeting between the US and former embajador Eduardo aguirre Fernández of the vega.
The vicepresidenta recognized that the report of the Council "had cogido the government of Zapatero was game" and insisted that Spain did not have nothing to hide in this issue.
"of the vega subrayó that Spain has no reparos to the vuelos intelligence through territory Spanish."
"ellos simply want to be informados" to avoid being "pillados desprevenidos," relata aguirre in a cable.
Also, then the titular of foreign Miguel ángel moratinos señaló, the ambassador that the executive Spanish "wanted to give this issue perfil the lowest possible, though, to be in the hands of judges, the government had a limited capacity of influence."
For their part, in January 2007, attorney Vicente González ran to the embajada that not intentaría block the initiative of the judge to ask for the desclasificación of papers of national center of intelligence (cni) and the ministerio defense about flights of the CIA.
These reports "not contienen no element incriminatorio or any sensitive information," after the embassy explained to talk with the prosecutor.
Yet the US reflected their concern for the apparent "coordination among the juez Spanish and German prosecutors," more than for the information desclasificada of cni or the Ministry of defense.
This "coordination among researchers independent will complicate life our efforts to manage the case quietly between governments," lamenta aguirre.
In March 2007 in a lunch ambassador between the US and the interior minister, Alfredo Pérez rubalcaba, it comentó that, "though Spanish judges are rabiosamente celosos of their independence, and harán what consideren right," he had given instructions to their collaborators "to evitasen comments of inflamada rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresa their concern for the performance of the PP in this issue.
"despite its orientation general proamericana, our experience suggests that the PP not dudará in capitalize on any indication that the government Zapatero toleró or deliberadamente ignoró actions of the US that could be interpretadas as possible violations of human rights, even if they have disclosure negative consequences for the government of the US," says.

The populares 4 would gain seats in the Congress and the PSC perdería 9
With the results of the 28-n, the PP could be decisive in the municipios of lérida, and tarragona Barcelona
After the major increase of votes and diputados experienced in the recent election autonómicas, the PP catalán already has the Vista puesta in the generales then, there is adelanto or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training obtiene in these elections usually the doblar that it receives in the catalanas.
Thus, the popular catalanes gained 610.473 votes in the generals of 2008, while in the autonómicas of 2006, the figure acceded to 316.222.
The past Domingo, the PPP achieved 384.091 votes.
If this stay tendencia upward, which has been nutrido of a trasvase of votes of the PSC and the fidelización's electorate PP, analysts of this training have calculated that, if elections were held generals, the PPP could happen of 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while ciu ganaría also four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations constatarían that the square catalana is fundamental to PP and psoe.
According to the analysis of the populares ERC, would lose a member -- now has three -- while icv is quedaría with a member or buy one.
But, to the timetable electoral maintained, the cita more inmediata will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the populares can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the capitals of four province and in its baton at the forefront of the diputación Barcelona, one of the most maneja Generation-long budget -- 661 million euros for 2011 --.

Given the debacle Republican, would not be set that this training losing their representation in the consistorio barcelonés -- is needed to get the 5% of the votes --.
The PP has tightened its number of votes in the four capital, and could be force decisive in Barcelona, lérida and tarragona.
Nationalists believe the power protagonizar turnabout in the capital, where tarraconense ruled with the PP before the current alcalde socialist, josep Félix ballesteros.
In lérida, the PP has been situado only to 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, àngel ros, maintains very good relations with mariano rajoy -- during this latest campaign, found themselves on several occasions.

The cell catalana facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand hubo three
The seven paquistaníes and the young Nigerian detained by agents of the comisaría general of information of the police in Barcelona as a cell jihadist that, dirigida from Thailand, facilitaba passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including the "for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil earth" (LTTE) and "laskar and taiba" (let), autor this last of the atentados of Mumbai that caused the death to 106 people in 2008.
The interior ministry has made great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Operation kampai" quedado "has weakened the" aparato of falsificación of Al Qaeda to international level, "and thus its operational capacity."
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to tailandia, where were falsified and then distributed to the groups that integran the galaxia criminal Al Qaeda to their "fighters" can cruzar borders European and other Western countries with complete impunity.
The cell destamantelada is not the only that the network jihadist had operational in Europe, hence that in investigations have participado of services, moreover, other Thai units European police, so it should not be descarta that in the territory of EU occur in the coming days coups, similar to the developed in the night of the past martes in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (were arrested the paquistaníes junaid humayun, atiqur rehman, jabran asghar, malik Ahmad Iftikhar Mohammad, saddique Khan Begum, tanveer arshad and the Nigerian babatunde agunbiade), in Thailand developed another with the capture of the paquistaníes Muhammad athar butt and zeeshan ehsan butt and the tailandés sirikanlaya kijbumrung.
These were the that dirigían since the Bangkok cell grounded in Spain and other European countries.
The network catalana -- part of it was golpeada in 2009 -- robaba mainly to tourists pasaportes that fulfilled the requirements scarred by the so-called "front islámico world."
That is, the documents were supposed to be the name of varones of between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years, and access estampadas visas.
In the media subraya research is that, for the moment, has not been encontrado no statistic vincule to those arrested in Catalonia with the bombing of Mumbai, despite the author of this attack, "and" laskar taiba, has been one of the groups recipient of the pasaportes stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must remember that days before that were made this bombing, since Catalonia were sent through an agency transfers of a thousand dollars that were "invertidos" in the purchase of cards móviles that were then utilizadas by the integrantes "command of the" that ended with the life of 106 people.
The police has been incautado of documentación abundant.
The PP to more aparque requires that the fiscal concierto
The leader of the PPP, Alice sánchez-camacho ocasión yesterday, had to exponerle personally to artur MAS their conditions to support his investidura as President of the generalitat, idénticas to the already that we can pose during the campaign, and that is resumen in give priority to the recovery of the economy and do without filo-soberanistas adventures, as is the concierto economic that the nationalist leader wants to the single in Ecuador of its mandate.
The of the popular catalanes came the meeting of artur MAS with the security that gives won 18 deputies in the election of the past Domingo figure, more than enough to want to be done, as the candidate of ciu needs at least one of the formaciones ejercerán that the opposition is abstenga in the vote of investidura.
One possible Entente with the PP depends the future alianzas that nationalists quieran maintain in Congress take place when general elections, but, for now, the conversations that these days keeps MAS with the rest of political leaders are made in clave catalana.
And in terms of's of the PP, to support a investidura "will have to be aparcar all the speeches soberanistas and independentistas", as well as the concierto economic -- similar to the country's Basque -- that the leader convergente intends to even subdue referendum.
Both leaders do have in common its bid for adelgazar the aparato political administration of a very autonómica inflated and the elimination of tax sucesiones and giving it away.
Of the details of the negotiation of the inauguration of more is ocuparán, by part of the PPP, jordi cornet and dolors montserrat.

The geriátrico claims that the deaths were not by "lack of measures"
Owners of the center of olot not descartan that its celador matara to more than 11 elderly
The perpetrators of the geriátrico caritat of olot (gerona) offered a yesterday waterwheel press to put highlighting the damage that he has causado to the institution of the criminal conduct Joan vila dilmé, the enfermero that while there was employee mató at least to eleven old people shattered it was to office.
The director of the residence, Joan sala, compareció accompanied by letrado of the center, the abogado Joan cañada, and announced that "the desire of the caritat would be able to exert the charge against the responsable" but "the deaths of legality and the responsibility to force US asumir the situation procesal of responsables civilian."
And it is that besides the desprestigio social that can sufrir the clearinghouse for not have time to detectado criminal activities of the celador, the great challenge to the caritat assumes now form of sustanciosa indemnización that are already calculando the legal representatives of the victims' relatives.
Joan vila dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009, and that since then has not ceased to kill.
The judge already sought in the car that ordenaba the exhumación of eight bodies -- of the old pacientes geriátrico -- that sospechaba that in many cases no doctor exploraba personally to the deceased, but that atendiendo to age and the patologías of patients, despachaba the trámite telephone.
The caritat, through its director, denied resoundingly yesterday this extreme and apuntó that "the lack of measures may not have been in no time the cause of what has happened."
The lawyer of the caritat added that "in the cause there is not a single indication that has been a reckless action by any other person is not himself imputado."
The already bautizado as "ángel of death" confesó anteayer 11 killings and detalló that the first crime it cometió 29 of August 2009, for a mes and a half more tarde, to kill a second abuela.
In this case, the death pinchándole provoked an overdose of insulina, unlike the first crimen that it made ayudándose of a mixture of pastillas sedantes.
The director of the caritat apunta that is complicado control that the staff of the center have access to the drugs.
The pinchazos of insulina and the cóctel of sedantes would have been the mechanism employee in six of the nine crimes that the enfermero, in its urge to relieve the suffering of inmates, usaba them to death.
But will be the analysis that are haciendo in the laboratory the that must aclarar if vila not miente and buscó for its first victims a death less cruel or if, on the contrary, the abrasó for within lejía by giving them as confesado that has already made with the three women who between the 12 and the October 17.
In the caritat not give credibility to the manifestations of the celador, or so siquiera to the number of asesinatos confesados, which is not descartan that higher, and justifican its attitude in the different versiones that has given vila in their visits to the juzgado and in the little sense that has to change its way to proceder after having committed, successfully, eight killings.
That is why ponen say that are available to justice to clarity on the scope of this event.
The ECB amenaza
Investors sharply yesterday reacted to the threat of yesterday that Trichet advertía "markets should not underestimate our ability of reaction."
Spreads periféricos have closed with force and the actions of European banks have gone up more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the ability of the ECB to be wrong, and the euro has barely repuntado which is a worrisome sign.
What has been producido yesterday is propio of a market ilíquido that like falls apart is recupera but motivated by closure of speculative and very short positions.
The institutional investor in tardará lose fear.
A month ago the ECB today we cited measures to withdraw liquidity and will have to retractar tomorrow by fourth time in two years and that there.
The Bundesbank required to finalize the plan's purchase of public debt by ineffective and eliminate all measures extraordinary of liquidity to term and dejando so solo acceso unlimited to week.
After the Irish crisis we expect prorroguen measures of liquidity current "at least until March" and maintain the subasta quarterly access with unlimited at the end of the trimestre to ensure liquidity at least until June.
Also expect continúen with its program of buying bonds, and even to place the signal to reinforce it.
If not cumplen with expectations generadas revertirán excellent the reaction of markets and yesterday if remain in obcecados withdraw measures of liquidity, but that God we asista!
Like his meeting in may, in which afirmaron that had not nor looked the purchase of bonds and markets collapsed, tomorrow could repetirse history.
The ECB should be credible and persistent.
In May anunció the bazuca the Monday, and the miércoles said that had already comprado much, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury single issued €500 million to 5,28%, versus 750 millions to 4,81% of the subasta anterior.
So the types aún in Portugal fell 30 points basic throughout the curva clearly, reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, has been made public figures of the agujero of allied and Bank of Ireland.
The numbers are estimated roughly 10 million short-term and other 15,000 potential and have until February to secure private capital or quedarán nacionalizados.
Although Ireland has no credibility after detectar not the problem in July with the test of stress, the numbers are asumibles within the plan aid and ayudan to reducing uncertainty.
Nevertheless, the next martes, the government will have to secure parliamentary approval of its new budget and does not yet have enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has toned the tone of his speech to ease tension of dear to the next summit jefes of state and government of the 14 December in which it is necessary to a political commitment that demonstrates that we are a union and that all tocamos the same partitura.
The problem is that Germany wants is coming to Wagner and the rest of the himno the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity to present the ayer plan of measures that aprobará the viernes the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in financial entidades autonomous and communities, of deficit reduction, privatization, liberalization, efforts to revive employment in oídos sounds of investors as the four of vivaldi stations.
The double effect Trichet and zp explains that the stock market has subido the Spanish 4,5%, the doble that the resto of europeas exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and forceful we are benefiting effect of the surprise.
Today, there is a key subasta of a bond to three years that be beneficiada by the effect Trichet for what esperamos that is resuelva with strong demanda and help dispel doubts about our ability of refinanciación.
For Spain demand a plan aid would be a self-immolation.
We would give a line of liquidity that not necesitamos, the Treasury have more than 40 million in the liquidez available triple that in March, to types carísimos and you cierra access to markets sine díe.
Nevertheless, the strategy must remain the of the woman's Caesar, moreover, "to be parecerlo."
Ánimo, we can.

Red bull succeeds in F1 with a weapon of secret Siemens
A software diseña improvements in cars in real time.
Since network bull irrumpió in the world of the formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select the speed of universo has been marked by surprise and by the success.
In a first moment nobody took into account the options for a escudería newly brought and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the end recta Cup all have bet for the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando alonso.
Without the ability of the desmerecer as piloto finally champion, the sebastian Alemán vettel, nor of the capacity of the motor Renault that drive his car, in the world of the formula 1 has become a legend the "secret" tool that the multinacional Siemens has puesto in the hands of network bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is in reality of a powerful software of simulación processes of the German puso in the market in 2007 with purposes far removed from the high competición automobile.
Denominado plm, this powerful instrument software has been used to design chains of montaje of factories manufacturing around the world, power plants, instruments of high precisely.
The goal is reproducir simulating, in a staunch the product or the process of real before construirlo way, avoiding in this way blunders and avoidable expenditures.
Plm has provided the development of the fotográficas of canon, moreover, of the aircraft sukhoi or more of the coches utilitarian célebres Nissan.
Siegfried russwurm, responsible for the division of industrial Siemens, explains that the use of this instrument software in its factoría of fórmula 1 has allowed network bull devise and to take effect "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes modifications, and improvements that is detectan during the careers and in the trials.
Russwurm explains the year that the escuderías in 1992 had an average of 10 técnicos in his team that were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during every season.
In the team network bull work today 180 young people profesionales of high cualificación that, equipped with powerful equipos computer, and analizan proyectan all sorts of changes in the bólidos.
The directivo of Siemens explained that the software plm is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the bólidos network bull with the exception of the motor, which es of the entire responsibility of Renault.
It modifican materials, fuel, and the aerodinámica elements of security.
The changes can be realized of the reality of the simulador virtual reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production through láser and autoclaves high-tech.
As only limitación of this crazy perfeccionamiento technological está the figure of 40 million dollars that each team of fórmula 1 can spend as maximum in every season to facilitate the competition.
Red bull has now put up the factory high-tech to devise and produce their bólidos in a location to roughly 50 kilometers of London.
These are two edificios in which they are cramped visits, especially for journalists.
Everything that there is acontece considered "high" secret.
The plantilla for this assignment amounts to 580 people, including its two pilotos, the campeón vettel and mark webber.
The hero of the formula 1 network bull, no doubt, is the recent campeón sebastian vetell.
Among the daunting technological resources that the mark of drinks energy has put at the service of their participation in the circuits, lies other protagonistas whose concurso is inestimable and its notoriedad zero.
The chief technology of the factory, Steve nevey, claims that could be afirmar five years ago that the progress of R + D in the cars carretas aportaban 50% of the victories and the pilotos were responsible for the rest.
Today, these porcentajes have varied and technology goes 85% of success, while the pilotos contributing to 15% of added value.
Nevey recognizes that the vettel or webber will never be sustituidos by the computer that are already "gladiadores unpredictable."

Sabadell stands for '' steal a million customers their rivals in three years
More optimistic that other bosses, the consejero surrogate of bank sabadell, jaime guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially rules out a new liquidity crunch vaticina and the end of the war's pasivo.
Despite this, provides a collapse of the márgenes of interests, which is intentarán compensate in part with subidas of commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes captar three years in a million of individual customers, its asignatura outstanding.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years, and thus able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will in motion in 2011 a new director plan that will have a status of three years.
The goal, in addition to survive without need to resort to the public's ayudas frob, is to gain market share in Russia with the capture of a million new prospects -700.000 particular if the descuentan that can go of banco-, its great asignatura pending, because so far mimado had more to the pymes and businesses that the cliente retail.
This year has capturing 250,000 customers and 50,000 individual companies.
Its market share in individuals is of 3.5%, which mientras en empresas supera the 10%.
Another of the foundations of the plan is the 2011-2013 bid for productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with reduction of costs and target, and whose challenges expondrá them when the Bank presente the results of the exercise.
Few banks are atreven in these times to aiming for a few objectives and make them because public that the financial crisis has trastocado all plans of the banking world.
Sabadell, indeed, this year will close its plan optima director, fixated four years ago, though initially era for three, but the situation of markets made it will extend a exercise more.
The clients who let the cajas savings will be its main goal.
In a desayuno organized by the apie, guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a year "difficult and trascendental."
The executive, indeed, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Moreover, in two or three years será "very difficult to create employment," something fundamental for the survival of the negocio banking, insistió.
And, although believes that the war's passive -que penaliza the márgenes- is shrinking, the price of the risk premia that are pagando banks and cajas by their emissions to obtain liquidity trasladando are already at the price of credit to compensate for the fall of the margins.
"the issue of the liquidity and financing is structural, and is going to be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We have not cerrado the tap, but spread are higher," reconoció guardiola.
Banesto already gave the Thursday orders to its net to curb the credit long-term rise, and the price of the differential -ver cincodías of 22 of November -- and 27.
Also recognized that the tendency of banking is up to now "commissions," but "there is a framework competitive."
The plan director of sabadell is based on the growth organic, though, as always, the group not descarta corporate operations.
Not in vano ensures that in Spain, "are to require higher size."
"The next year is to throw everything," aseguró.
It says that the needs of capital are "subido flabbergasted" and not descarta that any entity financial Spanish between in red numbers.
And apunta that the frob can suplir the market in the capture of funds to new recapitalizaciones.
After sabadell ensure that can survive the cierre temporary of markets, restó importance to what some bankers vaticinan already as a new liquidity crunch.
He points that cannot be emitir, but contrary to what happened in June, can be achieved financing short-term through repos, what amortigua the crisis.
The ECSC does it rule out a second surge of mergers in the cajas
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio olavarrieta, descartó yesterday that will producirse a wave of fusiones crates of savings and returned to insist on the speed with which is ejecutando restructuring of the sector.
When the process of arrancó concentrated of the Spanish cajas savings, were varias entities that aseguraron that not participarían in this first phase, and that is reservarían for the second round.
However, the director general of the confederación Spanish of crates of ahorros (ECSC), José Antonio olavarrieta, descartó yesterday that this new surge of operations to accomplish.
"creo that the largest part of mergers has been hecho, the incorporation of cajasol group of banking civic cannot be said to be a second round, there are adjustments."
"the largest part is fully made; it may instead of 17 vayamos to 13 to 14 but all the big procesos have become already and tutelados by the Bank of Spain, which in this has also colaborado flabbergasted," apuntó the directivo.
During a desayuno declarations of the Association of directivos and ejecutivos of aragón (adea), olavarrieta has expuesto that the process of concentration is acometiendo "to the greater velocidad possible, and we have to be very satisfied of as is taking place in the plazos that in his day, not now, in marcaron plans of business with the Bank of Spain, enfatizó."
"moving from 45 cajas with a media of 28.500 million volume of assets with 75.500 17 million is a process that has no equal in history, reducing the number of institutions in a 62% to make them much more big to comply with Basle," resaltó.
Olavarrieta recognized that "there are a series of opinions fairly little fortunate on slow process" that demuestran "a lack of seriousness and sense," because, "What does the Bank of Spain is remember that we have to estar within the term" before the end of the year.
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio olavarrieta yesterday, asserted that Spain has the financial system more riguroso across Europe and "probably" of the world, and atribuyó to those who ponen in impugn "a lack of knowledge."
The directivo apuntó that, within the current economic coyuntura, "we can be very tranquilos" with the situation of financial institutions and the cajas of saving, a system that has embarked on a process of "concentration importantísimo," and that "Va to the greater velocidad as possible."
Also recordó that the Spanish banking went well parada of the testing of stress that realizó the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but has established the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have caused a double response government.
On one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has moved new adjustment measures, from tax cuts to the pymes, regulatory of private credit agencies of colocación or supresión of the 426 €aid to parados without prestación, until the privatization of 49% of aena, of the management of barajas airports and the prat and the 30% of loterías of the state.
For another, the vicepresidenta Elena salgado, with the support of the expresidente Felipe González, has been added to criticism of the cancillera Angela Merkel by its responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
Vaya ahead of the position that Merkel is not a mistake in its policy comunicativa.
On the contrary, is another round of tuerca difficult in the process of redefining the euro.
And there, Germany has a radically nueva vision of what must be its future, that choca with the to maintain the old traditions of good part of their partners.
Faced with the European resistencias in Germany, begins to especularse about the three possible salidas to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, she integrated by itself, Austria, and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the South abandonaría the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now parezca science fiction, with a school of thought very favorable, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a rediseño euro, in line with the proposals of German greater control, macroeconomic rigor budget, multas to countries transgresores possible, suspensiones of payments of any of them and extensión the private sector of the costs of the adjustments potential.
The German position is clear and viene definiéndose long, so now poised excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF as the European Commission estimulaban deficits, the German government is sacó of the manga a constitutional reform to impedirlos out of the 2016.
This was the first sign of divergencia between what Germany believed that should be done (plans of fiscal rigor and stability in public finances), and what they were practicando its European partners, including France.
The second front in the it gave the country centroeuropeo when alargó penosamente Merkel's decision salvamento of Greece.
Already, then was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the publicada were very against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, of new Merkel is emerging with a clear position, demanding reform of the treaties of the Union, to make possible the salvamento of a country, and at the same time, forcing with private lenders to take part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as antieuropea, because it has precipitado the Irish crisis, and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat edulcorada, has been aprobado and, in the next few months, we should attend the process of reform of the Union that posibilite those measures from 2013.
Germany has trazado a red line that did not think cross.
And we all is saying that, although now has tomar measures with which is much may not agree to that date, from the old workings of the euro, they will be over.
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new área monetary, in which countries infractores will be severely sancionados, they may be forced to declararse in default and, in this case, the private sector also correrá with part of the cost.
Germany is US signaling that we must follow a path of severe growth with elevated rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and saldos foreign positive.
Another alternativa based on debt and construction, with huge agujeros in the balance of payments, like the one that has presidido Spanish growth in the years of the boom, simply will not tolerate.
The envite is clear.
And would we do not wrong in entenderlo.
Not to be trata alone reconducir the public deficit to the 3% in the 2013.
What we exigen is much more harsh.
And the worst in these circumstances that we could do is engañarnos ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil leave step to greater tranquilidad.
And that aprovechemos the ventana of opportunity that we have dado, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that the president Zapatero also has entendido so and his double manifiesto (reforms promised after the meeting of the past sábado with big business and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism to Merkel, has opened the way assumption that must order at home.
But the red line that Germany has trazado there is not, and it seems that will mover.
And, between the possibilities that is contemplan, to abandon a monetary area of countries atiborrada too little serious, cannot excluirse.
So Germany we can always say that we already had avisado.
Deporte and fraud of law
As the tretas of alonso and RAMOS to demonstrate the Ajax creative but not will to escape a penalty.
The expulsión presuntamente urdida by two players of real Madrid (xabi alonso and Sergio RAMOS) in the party contested 23 of the November against the Ajax in the champions league has to be lured escriban rivers of tinta about whether such behavior is whether or not antideportivo and, eventually, both players should be sancionados by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes going to the Party (his team had already clearly gained), the two players deliberately lost time to draw tracks faltas to provocar that the umpire them mostrara the second tarjeta yellow.
That way, and because the Royal already Madrid will it as leader of his group, both players cumplirán the sanctions regulatory the party of the next liguilla, against the auxerre, and will be able pasar limpios of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the Committee of discipline, UEFA has sancionado with the two parties entrenador team's, José mourinho, and with different amounts to the economic players involved.
The provocation of yellow circumstances as a card in this or similares is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
So widespread is that a part of the ethos of the rules, not escritas, but seguidas, of this sport.
Part of the debate itself in the case relatado is due to that has been protagonizado by a team of the body's real Madrid (in its himno presume that of nobleza and honor, and that in ocasiones past has multado players to their acts by analogous) and the dramatización orquestada, apparently, for mourinho, who añade a episode more to their dilatada story of técnico histriónico and provocador.
In any case, the debate revolves around to if this type of behavior prohibido not being by the rule-book contradicts the principles of sport, i.e., if with these actions are comete fraude of law; therefore, indeed, are actions respetuosas with the reglamento sporting, but seem to circumvent its sense.
The issue goes to examine the kind of damage that provocan the spirit of sport.
One of the goods that comprises the spirit of sport is the physical integrity of players antithetical, aspecto that with these actions are not in danger puso, i.e., there was no game violent.
Another of these goods to the alude with that is fair play is to prevent the team of players infractores is aproveche manner unfair team's opposite, which nor occurred.
But what paradójico of the action of players of real Madrid is that is not acomodó to what normally caracterizamos as cheat or fraud of law, as his violation of the rules are not made to escondidas to seek to avoid the passage, but that its precisely action sought to be more evidente as well to receive punishment of the referee.
Esperaban and aceptaron gustosamente passage.
Another question is what kind of advantage gets offenders in the faltas intencionadas examinadas.
Here, it seems constatar that need not be coloca situation in the desventajosa rival or be obtained benefit in the same party evidently, as the result of the action is supposed to leave the team itself with less players.
Nor is a useful and strategy for the next Partido, as the club will not count on these players.
The advantage, of course, is that the players empezarán the next phase of the champions league without cards that can threaten their participation in a future party.
But this is a mixed long-term, with a certain degree of indeterminación, as the team can be killed off to the first of change, and also with this performance players are responsive to a party of sanctions and pasan the second cycle of cards, in which the freeze by accumulation of cards comes with a less than in the first cycle.
In that, to go pasando rondas, is not so clear that is an advantage.
Ultimately, such actions not van against the spirit of sport, yes forma part of that take strategic decisions that favorezcan draw the maximum of what it allow the rules.
In the supuesto that we players play, not actuaron to evade the application of passage (yes, this would be a clear case of fraude of law), but rather that chose when submitting to it.
Tomaron without a strategic decision to circumvent the punishment or flee the same.
Although the border between the ingenuity and fraud law is blurred in this time, I believe that this was a clear case of creative.
The dispute, I parece arises, by two factors: because this two autoexpulsiones and by the way in which be played out the transmission of the directive of provocarlas.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ético as estético.
Ofensiva of offers to capture the sale of cenas groups in bcn
The dictatorship of the calendario commands this año a flood of reserves for the 16 days and 17.

Whatever the coyuntura, and a few others demand prices of battle, confirms the President of the gremi of restauració Barcelona, gaietà farràs.
The representative of the patronal, to día today's, is not atreve to vaticinar how will be the festejos of this month.

In another of the most powerful groups, andilana, with 16 establecimientos in the city (hostal Rita, of the market, the fonda and others), the distinctiveness of calendario has conllevado more reserva anticipated, even in early November.

In his six menús group have agregado one navideño, with the €30 or more as presupuesto star and the perception that there is a bias to spend more than 10% last year to exchange to demand more details, as cava.
Also ven green shoots in some firms that vuelven to invite their employees and sense that the volume of groups is something greater.
On the part of the patronal fecasarm (which includes entities as the Association of bares, restaurantes and ocio Barcelona), his vice president, enric gomà, trust in begin to see the end of the tunnel and that in a whole reserves are "lively," though customers negocian "to the fullest."
Yes, the illusion that by the celebrations has not descendido, pague, who pague indicates.
The nuclear program Pakistan generates great concern in the US
ISLAMABAD produces atomic weapons "at a faster pace than any other country."
The leaks of WikiLeaks confirman ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondencia between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department filtrada by the WikiLeaks portal confirms the huge inquietudes that provoca in Washington the nuclear program Pakistan.
At the margin of the esclarecedores and hefty detalles that offer about the content of the talks and the pensamientos representatives of American diplomatic acreditados in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in terms of security atomic, rather than go on the rise, "decrece," and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The particularidad program of the Pakistani -- that nuclear weapons are not ensambladas but remain almacenadas by components to making its destruction in case of ataque-- constitutes one of the main reasons why desvelo in Washington.
So the lists embajadora in Pakistan, W. Anne Patterson, in an informe previo to the visit of entonces consejero of national security, James Jones: "the proximidad of some instalaciones nuclear territory to low ataque Taliban, the rumoreada dispersión of materiales nuclear and the vulnerability of the transporte of materiales atómicos."
The high número of people involved in the nuclear arsenals, and in programs of missiles is already looked, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferante and motivo to maintain the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict creencias religiosas to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall of the educativos levels, and cultural extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in the nuclear programs, or of missiles," said the experto Yuri Korolev, the Ministry of Russian foreign, in a meeting with their American counterparts.
The latest of the documentación filtrada by the portal of Julian Assange is the increasingly lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on issues of nuclear proliferation and the high ritmo Pakistani of producing nuclear weapons.
A office of the embassy in May, which califica of "frustrante" communication with Pakistan, argues: "The transparency is often absent; the offers of help left unanswered or are descartadas."
In another message, Peter lavoy functionary, of the national inteligencia for South Asia, constata "that despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The embajadora Patterson also pide during a visit to Washington, the head of the army, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, which deje "very clear to the" responsible that "Pakistan's military must acabar with the tacit support to terrorist groups."
The head of the chase WikiLeaks'
Obama nominates a high responsible for the counter-terrorism struggle to avoid new filtraciones.
Interpol emits a alerta red with the end of following movements and localizar to Assange where esté.
Everything concerning WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and its, is a complicated laberinto where it is difficult to have certeza about the facts.
Yesterday, issued a alerta Interpol "red" to "localizar and follow movements of Assange."
However, this is not a order of arresto traditional.
Moreover, it is not new, but dating of 20 of November.
And not has to do with the latest release of more than a quarter of a million of US diplomatic documents but with accusations of sexual abuse that the australiano afronta in Sweden.
Moreover, the lawyer's creador WikiLeaks', mark Stephens, ensures that "the police and dónde knows how to put oneself in contact with Mr. Assange."
It was the day when the 20 body international police foreign-based lyón (France) dictó the order to solicitud of Sweden, but not reveló until yesterday, after receiving autorización of authorities of that country.
So, the countries of 188 Interpol have indicaciones to identify or to localizar Assange "towards its interim arrests and extradición."
Although Interpol cannot ordenar the arrest of a individuo affected by a alerta red, many of the member countries, according to the organization has explicado yes, consider the so-called net notice path to a free to proceder arrests --que must acometer the body of national policía-, especially if they have a bilateral agreement extradition, as is the case of Sweden and Britain, where is believed that is Assange.
The movement has indignado to the lawyers Assange than yesterday, published a Carta denunciando that WikiLeaks founder, of 39 years, it was prepared to respond by video conference to questions of Swedish authorities.
Recuerdan also that Assange solicitó and got permission to pull out of Sweden of the Prosecutor of his case, to which they liken with the mythical lavrentiy pavlovich beria, chief of Stalin's security.
"This parece a cacería, not a legal persecution," denuncia the misiva.
While the world it seeks -y Australia since his mother defends the inocencia of its hijo-- Assange remains in paradero unknown, but not callado.
On Monday he concedió from a place indefinite an interview the head of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which called for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, of the US.
"If you can mostrar that was responsible for order diplomáticos American that espiaran in the UN violating international treaties that the US has signed, should dimitir," he said.
His view was yesterday denostada by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, which calificó ridícula absurd, "and" the request of dimisión.
Not all of the "estoy insurance why we must importar opinion of a kind with a web page," he declared to the cadena CNN.
The Obama has entrusted to own a high responsible for the counter-terrorism struggle, rusell travers, to prevent new fugas of documents.
The attempt's portavoz of President Barack Obama to downplaying Assange contrasts with views that these days proclaman politicians and conservative commentator.
Peter King, the congresista that from January presidirá the committee of national security in the lower house, has called for the State Department that estudie the possibility of WikiLeaks include on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue cualquier them to that of any contribution or aid."
More lejos still has gone Tom flanagan, an advisor President Canadian Stephen Harper, which has had to back down after to say that Assange "should be asesinado."
"Obama should convertirlo in target and use a plane not tripulado or something."
Who is not disculpó was Mike Huckabee, ministro baptista, exgobernador of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"who is in the government that the filtró information is guilty of treason and anything that is not the execution would be a punishment too polite," he declared in the cadena Fox.

The president of the party is painfully aware that their amago of dimisión is inadequate for the afines by exlíder josep lluís carod-rovira, but also knows that the influence of this sector is now so diluida as its own mentor, and that in absolute can cause the head of quebraderos that had with other flows extinct.
Thus, the leader of esquerra will try to reach the new críticos with guiños that he permitan blindarse until municipal elections.
To begin with, puigcercós yesterday announced that the more than 200 consejeros national ERC will be able pronunciarse about his continuance in secret.
By papeletas, and not mano alzada.
If the carodistas want vehicular some vote of punishment, the president will be able to do so without fear to retaliate.
Indeed, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division of both as the time to its person.
In several entrevistas, claimed that is not consideraría ratified the mitad with one of the most votes, but added, without saying porcentajes, nor that would be a good outcome "to the búlgara."
The próximos to the President carod require something more than put his office at the disposal of the militancia, a gesture that not vale when it puigcercós maximum órgano between congresos.
But by the majority of disponer not enough to force dimisiones, are going to remember intentar with the ejecutiva a road map within may.
For this, they expect to participate in compiling the document of reorientación that the strategic direction someterá voting to the Council's National Day 18.
His intention is to avalar puigcercós to change that prometa Congress to call an early this autumn of 2011, something that the top already provides for fact.
The leader of ERC recognized that the "polifonía" perjudica stability and its goal is to make that once and for all, the organization is able to lavar the trapos dirty doors to within.
In this line, is the sintomático article that the conseller in office josep huguet signed on his blog.
The considerado ideólogo of puigcercós, the head of innovació gave by the fact that leader will be refrendado "to exchange of various objectives."
And enumeró cinco, which of the two stand out.
The first, "recomponer" the executive that represents for at least the 90% of the militancia, i.e., caras include new deprive delinquents with sector's afín to carod.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquide of once the asambleísmo as mechanism of operation.
Thus, calls for a reform of the statutory objectives for celebrate the congresos through delegados chosen by sufragio.
Breaking the model asambleario, an exception in the system of parties Spanish, has been a team's obsession puigcercós, already batalló in this sense in the last two congresos.
Indeed, the convulso cónclave 2008 the trust of the left to the direction of revising the asambleísmo Congress in a specific reform of estatutos.
This appointment remains pendiente, for the domestic tide of recent years desaconsejaba tackling the issue.
Now, without sectors critics Crouching can be a good time to try to retomarlo and cerrarlo forever.

In the end, luego of a acercamiento frustrated with the traumatólogo that it has the robado breath in half of the pasillo, but who aclara that llaga is not a term scientific; it is the psicoanalista who reveals the mystery: "the real issue is the open, what is the simbólico scar."
The player sighed aliviada and concluyó "of the issue only I know that the real es open and that there is no," but believed that the pleasures and the trappings of the tongue must go very entreverados.
Valenzuela, the escritora, jugó with both.
The nicaragüense Sergio Ramirez also exposed a deleitosa narración that tituló in praise of the invención, where the finger in the issue is not nombra but in a moment is descubre.
With pinceladas of magical realism, has a famous hechicera, that the same tocaba clouds, traía back to men who had been far or reparaba the virtues that had lost a doncella, narración that viró to speak luego America, the great novela to which would not faltaron since the principle that their own cronistas contaran and citó to Bernal Díaz of castillo who critica the excesos of what contado by the capitanes conquistadores.
"Cervantes that we inventó to all (writers) did mocked the testigos fingidos that aparecían in the stories presented as real, but in other words are never had come to count the history of America with imagination to which he faltaba until the pudor."
However, "are highlighted fools and the embusteros that the best imaginan" and is where converge reality and mentira, where it is known that no longer of what narrado belongs to a side or another, where the literatura of fiction run to its peak.
What llama fact of the ‘ tradition cervantina. '
For we are "inheritance Suya, what is cuenta."

The cubana-puertorriqueña pointed their GDP toward the great llaga of social violence that runs through his country -- and comparte latinoamérica- product of disputes traffic and selling drugs.
"I believe that the good literatura, good poesía, the good canciones encierran a commitment that tacit, of course, is not premeditado" indicó, after citar that the reality of the literature is communication and the dimension of commitment that establece between author and lectores, and that in a "reaction chemical" of this last.
The night the cerró the poet Spanish Luis Garcia montero whose intervention also made emphasis "of this finger in the llaga of escritor committed of writer."
Consideró that in a world that to live in a hurry, also in customs intellectuals and control of the conciencias that redunda in dogmatismos, olvidando "behind every claim that there is a small and not behind every denial is a small yes."
"to be masters of our thinking and be masters of reality: we have to matizar and matizar significa often put his finger in the issue and upset to people who are much more comfortable thinking in caricatura, in black and white, established in ideas and without shadings differed from, and also to upset the powers that prefer a world in black and white," he said, invitando to regain the sense of writing.

Rubén already lost two finales with the diablos red and a Monterrey, with his rival incumbent, thus does not want to take the same fate, seeks to shed the maleficio and festejar power for the first time, a title, although claims that for him is the most important institution.
"I want to exit champion, I don't want to break no statistic, this is by a club, by a afición to which I debo and by a consequence vendrá the title for my, but this is what matters most," comentó the timonel when it is about about the numbers that has against jugando final.
Existing has the very end of the previous, which, asegura, has learned much, "the only enseñanza that we can have is that the arbiter silbe until the end cannot party, we are prepared in the line, also players, because last time, with two penales for flip as we were prepared to get out corriendo and I believe that is a lesson, so that the Party can not be termine party."
Knowing that this Serie could definirse in tiros criminal, something that it is not inquieta, as confía in their players: "One never seeks to reach the tanda of penales, one seeks to end in time regular, but sometimes there is not another of and needs to be prepared, the tournament in previous estuvimos prepared, unfortunately, we made a bad stand the fate, sometimes by nerves or the anxiety of having the title in the hands, but we are fue, that we dejó something for this end that esperemos not llegue to that ultimately."

Can lucharse against migration underground without problems
The bill of conservatives who, according to the government, should solve the problem of the pateras cargadas of migrants underground, is certain to a large enfrentará opposition, as the three parties of the opposition have announced the miércoles that could not support it.
"me baso mainly in the Charter."
"I encuentro here with a party that has created the granito that pisáis," declared the leader liberal Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies following the celebration of the meeting of the weekly caucus.
Liberals defend that the bill in its current form, which would allow arrest until a year to any person proceda of a buque identificado as transport of immigrants, underground infringe the Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms.
The líder of bloc of Quebec, Gilles duceppe, also suggested that could not respaldar the bill because points to Blanco wrong.
"We are against and, it seems, all the parties of the opposition are against the project, so that already veremos what does the government," he declared Mr. duceppe.
The critique of the npd in terms of immigration, Olivia chow, has rechazado of a coup that the criticism that his party is not enough decisive with immigrants underground.
"The neodemócratas agree that is adopten action against policymakers pateras of clandestinos, and that is what pretendemos with another bill, the c-35," says the Ms. chow.
"not apoyamos the bill of conservatives ataca because of refugees and encarcela to children during a minimum of a year," explica Mrs. chow.
The minister of immigration, jason kenney, has indicted parties of the position to play to politicians and to ignore the willingness of Canadians.
"the great majority of Canadians says to the diputados that not fear-mongering this kind of migration underground criminal against these operations, Canada, and that the country tratan as if it were a felpudo."
"hope that Canada take a firm measures," opina the minister kenney.
The government has not anunciado a vote of confidence on its bill, which could bring the country to a elections as a result of its rejection.
Nevertheless, a conservative has comunicado to the agency qmi that the government was going to solicitar the celebration of a vote that for every diputado that will be to oppose explique after their voters.
The new unity not consigue unanimity
Despite that had been anunciado possible the creation of a permanent unit of struggle against corruption and collusion by Jean charest, many observers continue for the establishment of a Commission of Consulta public on the issue.
The minister of the public security, Robert dutil, that supports this idea has not arisen ago: two días Quebec would have consultado with the Department of investigation of New York question is enero since last year.
The metrópolis owns a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the announcement of the martes has pillado by surprise to more than one.
One decir that, during a meeting of permanent Council on services police of Quebec held the last October 29, were never debatió this move, despite the presence of Robert dutil.
This was enough to that the critic of the party quebequense deals that the issue of the public security, Stéphane bergeron, calificase this announcement as "a conejo sacado of the chistera" and "as a solution chapucera of latter day."
The minister dutil, for its part, has responded to those who fear that the political power have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"veréis the results when it anunciemos," simply indicates.
"somos aware of this problem."
For the President of the csq, réjean parent, there is nothing that can sustituir the launch of a survey public.
"The more is obstina Mr. charest to avoid the creation of this Commission of research, more people share our view, i.e., which has something to hide," explica.
"The only mode to dispose of a Commission of research is with the resignation of Jean charest," explica Yves boisvert, a professor of ethics and gobernanza of the National School of public administration.
To get out of this deadlock, sugiere to Quebec that conceda a mandate to the special interventor general for that realice a poll on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the interventor General," concludes.
Similarly, believes that could interventor Quebec otorgar at the same competencias that to a sheriff around, as well permitiéndole forcing people to testificar.
The creation of a permanent cuadrilla is not the only project in the making in the government charest.
Quebec solicita also to Ottawa that modifique the criminal code for adapte better to this kind of crime.
This seems to proceder application of the Prosecutor of the operación marteau, which has informado the minister of justice jean-marc fournier that the jurisprudencia is not explicit in this kind of research.
The federal minister of the public security vic toews, for its part, has confirmado that its homólogo of justice, rob Nicholson, currently tend to perform certain amendments in relation to this issue.

The "San shou" or "sanda" is a disciplina originaria of China in which allowed to be hit with the puños and feet, as well as the adversaries plunging the land.
The clashes was originally celebran on a platform, and less often, in a ring.

450 million in contracts without licitaciones
Hydro-québec has been granted contracts direct worth $450 billion to companies of engineering project for the hidroeléctrico eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert.
In the center of this flood of more than a hundred contracts is a consortium formed by firms bpr, dessau, and Groupe sm axor, which has attained without a licitación prior contract, the most important of the management of the project, by a sum of 295 million.
The Consortium, called énergie gérance was created in 2004, following the decision of hydro-québec to rely on the private sector its responsibility to manage this important project hidroeléctrico of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the énergie gérance consortium won the lucrative contrato without realizase previously a licitación public.
For the party quebequense, the resort to consorcios of firms poses a serious problema ethical that amenaza to eliminate competition and provoking a run-up in prices.
"It is a new method of collusion and to eliminate competition."
"that is, people, rather than do so in secret, now openly do," he declared the diputado yesterday's party quebequense sylvain simard in a waterwheel press.
More early, for the morning, Mr. simard raised the issue at the National Assembly because, according to claims, not understand how can be benefit to the public interest in this way.
The minister of natural resources, normandeau Nathalie, responded by the afternoon, firmly deny that has producido a colusión with this contract.
"empiezo to cansarme," protestó, defendiendo that the pq had actuado so "deshonesto" and "with lack of rigor."
Señaló that "the minimum" sería that the pq is disculpase.
The formula of the consorcios is a common practice in the entire world.
Usually, this is an alliance with a temporary límite that allows companies to two or several agrupar their knowledge to respond to a tender for a project complex.
The project eastmain presents a high level of complexity, considering the magnitude of buildings.
The obras have already empezado and durarán until 2012.
In all the case, the contract has been concedido without that entrase stake in competition; it has tratado of a negotiation.
Moreover, the formula of the consorcios has no longer the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for projects relatively simple.
Such as publicaba last week, I devoir the formula of the consorcios in the sector's asesoramiento technical is being subservient to a research in the government.
A quick glance at record of mercantile Quebec allows identify more than 200 consorcios, some of whom seem permanent.
Thus, the empresa dessau works in association with most of its main competitors, as cima +, génivar, snc-lavalin, roche et tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single persona legal, i.e., dessau.
As for the consorcio énergie gérance, the Minister normandeau has destacado that "the territory of the bahía James responds to a particular dynamics of labor and hydro-québec specifically responds to it since the early 1970's."
The great head of the project eastmain, réal laporte, of the Société d 'énergie of the baie James (sebj), has given a explanation that has destacado the fact that the contract management of the project has been concedido directly.
"If respondes to a tender, and there are few participants, your price are going to be higher."
"tienes two options: you can enter into contact with the sector's players and say: are we to negotiate a satisfactory agreement, and with a good price."
"But the idea is that what matters is not the price, but competition of the people," said the señor laporte.
The contract given the consortium énergie gérance forms part of a long list of contratos of more than $50,000 gained by the party quebequense.
Contracts were concedidos by hydro-québec or the sebj for the project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert.
After the comprobación, he has identified devoir 109 contracts asesoramiento technical vested between 2002 and the año marzo of 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, in particular laboratorios geotécnicos.
Snc-lavalin has won 22 contracts, génivar secured 16, tecsult 14 and dessau 10, without take into account their participation in énergie gérance.
All contracts were negociados.
In total, add up to $449.783.344, including the contract énergie gérance of $295.131.564.
Sylvain simard has suggested that the four firms that make up the consorcio (bpr, dessau, and Groupe sm axor) are "good known liberal party of Quebec."
The minister normandeau has made that the fall pq is also linked to these companies, which it "financian", before it is well need more of their leaders.
Barómetro consumption responsible. The label "green" not inspira confidence
More ecological, but deeply escéptico.
The consumidor quebequense barely trusts actors of sustainable development, as well as in brands nor fair trade in the certificados ecological to guide their elections.
According to the barometer of consumption responsible, whose first outcomes have been publicado yesterday, the situation is even worse. Consumidor the is immersed in a universo media by where pululan mensajes who defend a more responsible consumption, but lamenta the lack of reliable information and considera that even this frena its commitment.
Even if has increased the consumption of the so-called "products socially accountable" in 2010, the quebequenses seem to give very little credit to those who seek to selling them.
Two thirds of them say, indeed, that do not trust the commitment of environmental firms or in the publicidad ecologistas of imports, reveals the tool of value elaborada by the observatorio of consumption responsible of the University of sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers puts in doubt the reliability of the certificados official carrying the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the goods and marcas that llevan etiquetas hinting that are "ecorresponsables," says the barometer.
Likewise, just a 14,6% of the quebequenses troops toman en serio the discursos of the políticos sobre esta cuestión.
In any case, the information on consumption responsible seems essential to stimulate consumption, this sector sustentado currently for about one-third of consumers quebequenses.
Indeed, the lagunas and the character of dubious information make a 46% of consumers desechen this option.
This is the second obstáculo identified by the barometer, following the precio higher of these products.
Moreover, a third of the quebequenses say also beware of the supposed rendimientos of the ecological products or services that they intenta sell.
On the other hand, nearly half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the mark of one or several products to respect their convictions.
A 61% has given priority to purchases stores in its neighborhood, and has preferred to buy cultivated food products in his region, says the barometer.
More Verde and responsible (the rate of consumption responsible has reached 64 points on a maximum of a hundred this year), the consumus of Homo Quebec adora occupy the post of the King's reciclaje that attempts to reduce its impact on the environment preocupándose environment for the protection of the fauna.
Yet, according to the barometer social conscience, this seems to be doors (out of its car): in 2010, so the solo 28% of the quebequenses indicated that has used the public transportation or have shared car to defend their principles ecologistas.
Moreover, the 39,1% of the participantes of esta amplia encuesta of comportamiento, that acaba de completar their Primera edición, apoya the uso of the bicicleta and desplazamientos to foot.
A loan to that the state should regain excentris
The government of Quebec, to which have asked that is comprometa financially in the recovery of the complex cines excentris pos the Société angus and the parallèle, acepta collaborate, but only mediante a loan.
The Société of développement angus and the parallèle, who expected a donation of seven billion of the Ministry of culture to return to comprar Daniel langlois to the complex Franco-Polish film excentris in the bulevar saint-laurent and return its true vocación cinéfila, have not obtenido what pedían.
The government has agreed implicarse on the issue, but in their own conditions.
Instead of the donación expected, the government of Quebec proposes a loan whose cuantía would, in fact, below expectations initial; it could provide a viable solution in conditions ventajosas, at least in view of particular empleados public.
Quebec had already rejected the past primavera first a plan of action and a request 12,8 million, but desde entonces Las solicitudes troops have revisado a la baja.
The president of the Société of développement des entreprises culturelles (sodec), François macerola, which lidera the file excentris, remitió a proposal and a plan of action to the minister st-pierre.
He has remitido a final report makes a decena of days.
Nevertheless, the sodec received a contrapropuesta cabinet the martes.
The parallèle and angus have of term until the 31 of December to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that must desecharse completely the assumption of a donation of the state.
Recall that the Association of owners of salas of filmmakers and complex of cinematic Quebec opposed to a direct investment of the state to support the recovery of excentris, arguing that the Ministry of culture must not housing finance projects, because it has not done with other courtrooms movie.
On the other hand, various representatives of the sector Yes are pushing for a considerable economic help.
Daniel langlois, the man who of the same, has pushed for ten years of the burden of the movie night in their locales author of the complejo finance, after its own construction, which could justificar abrogation by a part of the Council Treasury.
The lack of salas for movies independent is patente in Montreal and excentris had known this fidelizar to their clientele.
The empresa angus and the parallèle, directed by Christian yaccarini impulsan, for their part, a campaign financing in private, waiting to raise $700 to muddling through toward the takeover.
Since spring 2009, just one of these salas, the parallèle, remains proyectando movies in excentris.
The goal of the future is compradores reopening the three salas the next February 27, casts the precious film Xavier beauvois "des hommes et des dieux."
However, Christian yaccarini not has returned to put oneself in contact with Le devoir and we do not know what opinan him and his group of proposals to that have received.
One is the velo of Canada acomplejado …
The new American diplomatic cables divulgados by WikiLeaks desvelan what the United States regard as the complex Canadians with respect to the Americans, but reflejan at once the feeling of superioridad of these past toward Canada.
But American diplomats are sorprenden voters Canadian not piensen in relations canadá-estados United when they go to votar and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the conservative government to get that is aprobase its budget in 2009!
The four new comunicaciones between the American Embassy of Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday, offer rather jugosos detalles that contenido really substantial.
A cable of 22 of September 2008, i.e., for full federal electoral campaign, relata the extent to which the United States not entran in the issues debatidas by political leaders.
This provoked large sorpresa the embajador American sent Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations about this situation.
Perhaps "political leaders are conditional on a inferiority complex virtually inherente to Canadians to treat the domestic issues daily, rather than leave such election to the United States (as during the campaign about free trade in 1988)," writes.
Thus, concluye, the United States are "the proverbial elefante of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to speak of it."
The ambassador has even more problems in understand this "silence ensordecedor" because the two countries maintain a intense political and economic relations.
Logically, "opina, the ability of a candidate, of a party, and even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which should pensar voters to vote."
This can be observed feeling of importance also the cable envoy the 22 of January 2009, commissioned by terry breese of business in Ottawa, to prepare the President Barack Obama for its first visit to Ottawa.
"his trip to contribute to ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February about the federal budget, through which Canada registrará deficit for the first time in the last decenio due to a recovery plan of between 30.000 and $40 billion," writes Mr. breese.
In no side is ago mention that the government had to prorrogar parliament before Christmas to prevent him sustituyese the coalition, or that the parties of the opposition condicionaban its survival to the quality of the plan proposed recovery.
Another comunicación January 2008 signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington on the image increasingly negativa that are likely to transmit the dramatic difundidas series of cbc in the United States.
The ambassador worries about the issuance of border, little on the mosque prairie, intelligence and H2O, in which are ongoing little sutiles references to maher arar, to "no-fly-list" or even to kidnapping to realizing that the CIA energetic interrogatorios.
Another cable that counts, during his first encuentro bilateral, Hillary Clinton asked to its counterpart French Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to acoger to some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner responded that did, but that depended on "of each case."
At the end of the meeting, wrote "has entregado a document secretary of state in relation to Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of origin Canadian."
"The secretaria agreed to revise the reopened."
Finally, we can mencionar that have been calentado feathers in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom flanagan, old consejero very close to Stephen Harper, declaró in the radio of cbc that responsible for this fuga mass should be "assassinated."
In the United States are made of ECO Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancún a plan of renewal of lighting, domestic trade and industrial in a hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (gei) in an amount that should play virtually to a third of the disminución additional that must llevarse conducted to stabilize the planet's climate before 2020.
This ambitious plan is enmarca in the set of large specific projects that the UN expects that is adopte in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding commitments reduction in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented ayer, if the bombillas incandescentes, which still monopolizan between 50 and 70% of the market, sustituyesen by bombillas fluocompactas or, even better, by bombillas of diodos electroluminescentes (from "or" led in English), much of the evitaría 1,800 million tons of gei emitidas (Gt) in the planet to iluminar to humans.
The iluminación is responsible for the 8% of world emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of emissions of parque car global.
In Copenhagen, the last year, the big countries emitters, as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including canadá, pledged with a few plans of retrenchment voluntary that were disminuir global emissions of gei of 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, should disminuirse even 5 Gt of such cantidad to stabilize, before 2020, rising temperatures in two degrees centigrade to avoid being descontrole.
In the bombillas incandescentes, the 95% of energy disipa in the form of heat and the rest, i.e., a 5%, produces light.
In the case of the bombillas fluocompactas, spending of energy boils down in a 75% and with the new bombillas's, is still reduces twice the more energy consumption.
The bombillas fluocompactas duran an average of between 6.000 and 10,000 hours.
The new bombillas's, as the that has lanzado the fabricante Philips this semana (a company that, moreover, has participado in the study of the UN), possess a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and a consume less energy that 80% of a bombilla incandescente, what we permite asking a idea of the savings that can be conseguir with the substitution plan that would apply in a hundred countries.
These new bombillas also can work with reóstatos and emiten very little heat.
Above, not contienen nothing of mercurio.
Various specialists have shown their reserves in relation to the bombillas fluocompactas, puesto that contain mercurio and that must eliminarse as residuos dangerous, which is not always possible in developing countries, salvo that the manufacturers coloquen instructions.
However, the report suggests, the main source of exhaust mercurio in the planet are not the bombillas fluocompactas, but the centrales térmicas coal, that they issue a large number of mercurio to produce electricity to be wasted with the bombillas incandescentes.
Only in the United States, such centrales issue 25,000 tons of mercurio per year.
The report detalla the advantages that would provide this program international to each country.
For example, Indonesia ahorraría in this way billion annually in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e., the equivalent to 3.5 centrales térmicas whose construcción Le costaría 2.500 millones.

Asunto clotilde reiss: the Élysée Palace has exagerado the mediación of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and Mayo of 2010, the fate of clotilde reiss, the young French investigative stuck in Iran by "espionage," has tenido vilo in the public in France, has alertado to diplomacy and has acentuado the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the atenta mirada of diplomats of America.
The documents American earned by WikiLeaks and consultados by Le Monde reveal certain aspectos unknown of this crisis.
Describen how the Élysée Palace has explicado their approach to the Americans to the point of them advice to manage their own crisis of "rehenes" in Iran (a small group of senderistas).
How exhibit the responsible for franceses tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French not occurred in exchange for the liberation of Majid kakavand, a iraní arrested in France and wanted by American justice by tráficos material for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulated to the media to give the idea that Syria's President, bachar al-Assad, had played a critical role in the release of clotilde reiss.
In fact, did nothing.
A telegrama diplomatic redactado 12 of August 2009 in Paris takes the title "Iran: French comments about the way to manage the cases of hostage taking."
The consejero of eliseo for strategic affairs, François richier, accompanied by the head of the quai d 'orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, patrice paoli, conversan with the US diplomática Kathleen allegrone.
He explain the French method.
Aconsejan to Americans that make the following to repatriar to their own ciudadanos withholding to force in Iran.
"haced ruido," dicen, "soltad continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "inocencia immediate," "liberation."
All avergonzar to the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When Iranians shall pidan that paréis, hacedlo often still more."
Because, once exhausted attempts by channels of negotiation, "the discreet silence will not solve nothing," the Iranians are "experts in delaying stunts."
Mr. richier añade that the arrest of foreigners "is a tactic Iranian usual: hostage taking for political blackmail."
That heralds the Liberación of prisión of clotilde reiss (will occur 16 of día in August, that is refugiará the embassy in France) "will require the abono to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (€230 of reward).
Moreover, points out that the Élysée Palace anticipa other hostage crisis, a phenomenon that "is set to increase."
The Iranians could "in a future next stop another of the roughly 1,800 a French living in Iran," says.
28 of August 2009.
Clotilde reiss it in prison after twelve days, but it is blocked in Iran.
It difunde the next información: the Iranian Majid kakavand, whose current extradition solicitan America by tráfico ilícito of material electronic delicate toward Iran, has been puesto in freedom in Paris for decision of a judge.
The American Embassy, like numerous observadores, dudan of this odd coincidence.
WASHINGTON, cerca that for the redes clandestine Iranian of adquisición of material for the nuclear program, the excarcelación of Majid khakavand constitutes a bad news.
France has accepted a exchange?
Does the Iranian free to change the francesa?
During a new conversación with Kathleen allegrone 4, the September, François richier ensures that it did not.
The Élysée Palace, claims, not only "has been sorprendido enormously by the judge's decision," but that has trying to oppose the same.
"There has been intense negotiations between the presidencia French and the minister of justice" (in the time, michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot destroy the decision judicial, comenta."
Mr. richier also wants to prove that Majid kakavand remains under the "close vigilancia" of services of French information.
The consejero Élysée marks a number of phone, cuelga and, later, to the American diplomática reports that the iraní "is currently in a few edificios of Paris state-run the embassy Iranian."
During the arrest of clotilde reiss in Iran, not in the Élysée Palace escatima efforts comunicados plow, "and" fugas organized in the media to believe that the Syrian President al-Assad bachar it plays an important role "" and "influyente" of "mediator."
Americans look at this activity with some irony that comprueban and manipulation trae off, because several articles of the French press transmiten official version.
A telegrama with date of 25 of August 2009 menciona "the 'blitz' mediático of French officials."
Why such "gratitud toward" Mr. Assad, is the pregunta embassy in Paris.
"despite their declaraciones stuffed with praise, French officials admit in private, so that solo have a vague idea of what really have done the Syrians."
Next, the document is the reasons that have brought to the eliseo to give rise to this fiction.
The great effort of communication "has to validate the policy of Sarkozy's opening towards Syria, opina."
A policy launched in 2008, that "in the view of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had to be tachada of prematura and desmerecida."
The "to exaggerate the Syrian" role, Paris tries to "show Syria to the elogios that can cosechar if desempeña a constructive role in the region".
The goal also consiste in "sow the seed of the discordia between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows of good fuente.
The 11 of August, François richier him confía: "of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done algo or not."
"But Nevertheless it, we have agradecido."
"at least, this should provoke confusion between the Iranians."
Clotilde reiss regresa to France, on May 16 of 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy's recibe in the Élysée Palace.
In a communiqué, agradece presidents from Brazil, Senegal, and sirio that have desempeñado "an active role in favor of the release of our compatriota."
From medianoche, the young coreanos cannot jugar in hardline
The South Korean government is going to adopt a so-called "law of Cinderella" that impedirá teenagers Games to participate in online after the half its night blocking access, according to have suggested responsables government.
In December someterá is a project of law to parliament to ask companies Games in línea that bloqueen access to these juegos after medianoche to the young people of less than 16 years, according to have suggested representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"many children juegan throughout the night and, later, find it hard to study in school and take a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is needed to protect their health and its right to sleep," declared the afp jo Rhine, responsible for ministerial responsible for the project of law.
The Games will be in line of new disponibles to the seis of the morning.
Firms dispondrán of a year to prepare for the application of the law, precisa.
The government plantea similarly ask companies that limit the time of daily access to these games when parents of the young it request them, chirped the responsible for.
Moreover, will put at the disposal of whom it will gratuitous computer programs that make it possible to limit the time of connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most countries "conectados" and newspapers regularly Dan news about various facts linked to a intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed world champion of the competiciones Games in line.
In November, South Korea got four medallas of gold in the world cyber games, where enfrentó 58 to other countries.
2018-2022 FIFA World: designa to countries organizadores
In the midst of the storm caused by the suspicions of corruption, the executive committee FIFA designa Thursday to the countries of the world's organizadores canopy of 2018 and 2022, a political choice clearly where the struggles of influence and the lobbying can reach primar on the technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the paper (of 2018 of the competición of FIFA will take place in Europe, bastión traditional of the discipline (four candidatos: inglaterra, Russia, and españa-portugal countries bajos-bélgica).
The paper (of 2022 will be far more exótica, given that the International Federation hopes conquistar new territorios (Qatar, Australia), after a estreno on the African continent in 2010, or its continued will in the United States or in the wild Oriente (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalidades that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of government Belgian and neerlandés, Zidane, Beckham, cruyff) is testimony to the economic and political interests at stake in a world.
Transactions between the wings, therefore, it is possible that duren until the last minuto.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the report assessment of FIFA, the candidaturas English, hispano-portuguesa 2018 () and estadounidense (2022) possess better case that their competitors.
However, these considerations do not have much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee to vote.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelaciones that led to the suspension of corruption by two members of the CE (reynald temarii and Amos Adamu), could have arruinado so the opportunities of his country, cuna football, so that the world sólo acogió once, in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the fire on Monday by spreading a documentary film that has placed in evidence to three influential members of the CE, Ricardo teixeira, Nicolas leoz and issa hayatou.
Suficiente to disgustar to FIFA and to embarrass the responsables ingleses, which have been lanzado to an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron to the head.
The head of government hopes reeditar the coup given successfully by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had conseguido in 2005 London for the organization of the jj.oo. 2012.
This intense activity, will be enough to restore the brightness of England to the EC?
Is not clear, as the dúo españa-portugal cuenta also with numerous puntos strong thanks to their stadiums, already listos, its experiencia (world of 82 in Spain, jj.oo in Barcelona in 1992, copa of Europe in 2004 in Portugal) and its culture futbolística.
However, the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could echar down their ambitions.
The possible represalias against the British and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, the only thing that consiguen is giving points to Russia, which became an outsider weight, despite the lagunas in his candidacy (estadios, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and denouncing a "unfair competition in preparation of the vote," in a direct allusion to accusations of the press English against the members of the CE.
"They are sacando out their trapos dirty, trying to comprometerles," Putin.
For 2022, the United States, which have the experience of 1994, the favoritos seem more lógicos.
First and sede global economic power of the main patrocinadores of FIFA, the country seems to llevarle advantage to Japan and South Korea, which have developed a separate excellent project.
However, these new candidaturas seem premature for two countries that have organizado together the campeonato in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the world 2026 to China, fervientemente deseada by FIFA, which provocaría that Asia is quedara without possibilities for 2022.
Together to Qatar, which has presentado its project based on estadios futuristas, and Australia, FIFA proseguiría with its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries have more riesgos that certezas.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, it could also be adversely affected by the weakness of the rights of TV paid (in terms of the difference horaria) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Segundo term: the Test
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had suggested that dudaba.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac nor the lower had no doubt.
Nicolas Sarkozy and fewer still.
A mandate in the Élysée Palace leads to another.
Thus, the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
Nevertheless, the evidence of this not combinan well with the misterio that tends to associate the presidential to function.
Thus, there is always to be aparentar that duda.
Towards a side and toward the other.
In 2006, though not creyesen, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that not descartaba a third term.
On November 15, in tono serious, Nicolas Sarkozy indicaba that will take its decision "sometime in 2011 autumn."
Thus, the fact that trate with members of the UMP, the martes by the night in the Élysée Palace, the possibility of "two mandates" has led some revuelo.
Is this the anuncio official of his candidacy?
Neither far less.
The president solo indicaba so that the constitutional reform of 2008 limitaba two to the number of commands of five years.
Simply transmitía facts, not a announcement.
It is not the first time that he of presidential ones, with a tone, in jocoso gatherings of this kind.
"in the worst, or better, of the cases, still pasaréis seven years and a half me," had soltado in July 2009.
In another occasion, in May 2010: "No penséis that I planteo what comes next later."
Their claims of anteayer would not acercan more to the candidacy, nor tampoco less.
Suscitan comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the ps, by a side.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has subido to the fore what lleva to Nicolas Sarkozy to sincerarse.
Rather, the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 it is obvious lleva to what many people in the ps claiming that to be organice before the battle of anticipated.
On the other hand, the bad sondeos.
For the first time, voters right-wing prefer's candidacy François Fillon's Nicolas Sarkozy (the 46% against the 44%, according bva-l 'express).
"We have a candidate in the UMP, and there is no discussion on the subject," has reaccionado immediate and prudentemente the environment of Prime Minister.
"If it thinks that can miss, will not be candidate," opina Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"always think that can win," corrige Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is being forced to maintain their acquisitions of letters of the state
The latest meeting of the Council of gobernadores of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow working out the exit patterns of the crisis, or at least, announcing the disruption of a large number of operations unconventional monetary policy that should finalizar at the end of the year.
Because of the sovereign debt crisis of the European, the Institute of exhaust Frankfurt without doubt permitirse will not be so perentorio if he does not want to risk aggravate a situation that more complicated today in markets of European obligations.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a waterwheel press, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, has endorsed the active role played by the ECB in favor of the solution of the debt crisis of the European states.
Has not been unwilling to say whether saw that the central bank should do more, for example aumentando its program of purchase of government obligations.
"I reservo my view for my fellow Europeans …."
The víspera, in Brussels, during his audience to the Commission of economic and monetary affairs of the European Parliament, ECB president, Jean-Claude Trichet, not was more elocuente concerning its intentions, indicating that only the program of buying of letters of the state in the market secondary "continuaba," and that "already veremos what decidimos" during the meeting of the jueves.
The one thing that is clear is that the ECB is going to maintain its main rate in the standard 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the adquisición obligations of Treasury by the ECB has doubled the week until reach nearly 1.350 billion euros.
Moreover, according to the indiscretos operadores market yesterday, would have bought again securities irlandeses and Portuguese.
In total, the central banks of the eurosistema have acquired securities by a cuantía of 67.000 million euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, is not duda most mínimo that seguirán purchases (consulte page 29).
Economists nor foresee no significant changes course.
Although the operations of loans to more than three months have already disappeared's arsenal of the ECB, it still performs asignaciones ilimitadas of liquidity to beneficiosas conditions and with duraciones range between a week, and three months.
Economists expect now goes this dispositivo for a few months.
"I don't imagino that will modify considerably its program."
"If not, correría risk provoking new tensions in the short term," opina Michael schubert, an economist's Commerzbank.
"seems more likely to be a progressive exit foretold during the first quarter of 2011," anticipa for his hand Norbert bräms economist, in sal.
Oppenheim.
In connection with the interventions in the market of public debt, "the ECB should keep buying a volume of these obligaciones for that the market is mantenga stable," añade Norbert bräms.
Considering the importance of the exposiciones of European banks to markets deudas sovereign of the euro zone, the Institute of scheme has no choice that mantener its presence in the market.
"must compensar at any price the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that would prevent a sharp ascent of the returns abonados by the most fragile states," opinaba yesterday a major manager obligations.
For, if the interest rates talk soar, states will have even more problems to reduce their indebtedness, or even to stabilizing.
This is the price to protect the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government capea the Storm
After Italy has empezado the week of a way worryingly, the situation has improved slightly yesterday with the reflujo of the types of obligations to 10 years.
A recovery of calm precarious.
The exit of a meeting with the Minister of economics, regional presidents have argued that escucharon to Giulio Tremonti rank the situation of "indescifrable" and that is esperaba a weekend "unforeseeable," desmentidas posteriormente statements by the interesado.
In any case, the martes the difference with the types long-term German had reached the figure record of 210 points basic and the price of contracts hedge against the risk of quiebra (crq) had been skyrocketing until the 263 points, causing a certain stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi remarked that, in Spain, the difference with the German types was above 400 basic points.
But his brass right, gianni letta, manifested itself "deeply concerned" by "turbulence in markets" and by getting the from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro zone, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explica Irwin, stelzer economist in the Hudson institute.
In fact, his problem is the lack of growth and stagnation of revenue associated to the same, what provoca that the state is not the risk of power hacer up to their needs of financing.
The last forecasting of Brussels have a jarro of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that growth Italian alcanzará the 1,1% in the 1,4% in 2011 and 2012, mientras que the presupuesto que está siendo examinado in El senado se basa in unas cifras de 1,3% and 2%, respectivamente.
In these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent the 4,3% of pib El year that viene (Frente at 3,9% per previsto the gobierno) and the 3,5% in 2012 (in Lugar of 2,7%).
Hence the word that can aplicarse new disposiciones budget after the fiestas, by a cuantía of 7,000 billion euros.
"If necessary, they will have to be new austerity measures," opina the Commissioner Olli Rehn, economic affairs.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"the foundations of its economy are in order, and their accounts in good shape, as llevamos diciendo since time ago," asegura arrigo sadun administrator, the Italian in the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, or short or long-term, because, despite its considerable debt (119,2% of pib in 2011, ndlr), Los esfuerzos of stabilization solicitados in Italia are menores que Los requeridos to otros" countries, comenta Pier padoan Carlo, economista jefe of the ocde.
There is the problem of political instability.
The 14 of December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a moción censorship in the Chamber of Deputies, after which could anticiparse elections in late March.
In that case, would be a period propicio little to decision-making in case of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflexionan about the refuerzo of the mechanisms of struggle against the Crisis
Christine Lagarde it already has repetido yesterday during a waterwheel press in Paris: "I believe that we have already demostrado the Domingo, by the night and by the day, that Europeans are clearly solidarios, decididos, committed to the defense of its currency and its monetary area."
Although was relative, the relajamiento ayer recorded in the types of the obligations of European states has prompted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot hablar still a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that could decline rated debt of Portugal, the more frequent target in the especulaciones today.
"like that in May, missing really clarity and transparency political, which pesa significantly on the banking systems," opinan economists of exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the pace political is far more than the slow pace of markets."
Knowing this hiato and the dangers that esconde, European countries intensify debates to reinforce the mechanisms of existing exit the crisis.
The consultas informal between the ministros finance that are more directly affected and, in general, with their counterparts in the G-20 go on the right track.
And this teniendo account also meetings of the eurogrupo and the Ecofin early in the next week.
The ECB meets today.
In the order of the day, the kind of non-conventional measures of support for the countries of the euro zone in the colimador markets (consulte more arriba).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has opened the martes in Singapore a journey by Asia to inform investors of the Far East about the novedades of the crisis in Europe.
Although the goal of these visits consiste in not raise funds, without doubt sets the stage.
Projected that the first issues of securities of the EFSF was realicen the next month.
Yesterday, a representante official US has relied on the Agency Reuters that the United States apoyarían a potential increase of funds movilizados through direct additional a commitment of the IMF.
As for countries that are at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, they prepare to adopt structural reforms, in particular, in relation to the Organization of the labor market.
Add to these reforms of austerity measures with a effect closest.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward for a different camino to which followed in Greece and Ireland.
Both want to bypass all costs for international aid before to pursue their own correcciones budget and decide the structural reforms that they see as indispensable to increase the confidence of lasting way.
The capitalist European partners of funds, finally, plantean options available to accelerate the process of normalization of markets of public obligations.
In Paris, step by the November 24 Axel Weber, was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750.000 million euros movilizados by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union not dudaría in return to sacar the portfolio.
Economists Barclays Capital, a front-line main player in the market of the deuda European public, consider that a cuantía of around 100 million additional €would be enough, "preferiblemente" in the form of inyección direct of liquidity.
There is the instrument for this: the mechanism of European financial stabilization, dotado today with 60 billion euros.
A advice, without doubt, could consider in detail the European capitals.
Especially if worsen conditions of market.

Metro's grand Paris: first borradores financial
Since the debate about the modernization of the transportation in the island of France has reached its álgido point, llueven billions.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, talked about the 23.000 million for the subway's grand Paris that must make the Société du grand Paris.
To begin this SGP, the state has announced a allocation of funds 4 billion euros.
's theoretical, this sum will permitirá subsequently to obtain the SGP loans in markets to finance a part of his double bucle.
Today, finally have the first cuentas.
The law of finance rectificativa of 2010, examinada in the Commission's finance the National Assembly, this mañana contains devices projected to find the first part of this money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special impuesto of equipment and the increase in the tax on the offices in the island of France.
The first, according leemos in Article 15 of the textbooks of the draft bill, "it is in the interest of the institución public Société du grand Paris."
Moreover, is embedded in numbers: "This is the product of tax of 117 billion euros per year."
The second is a change of a tax on the oficinas that already exists modernizarlo, "to increase their product and diverting such an increase to the Société du grand Paris."
How much is obtendría with this method?
Who knows.
In the text is not grasp numbers.
But is far from 4.000 million.
"It precisa that the fiscal resources are añaden to the 4 billion euros of assigning funds that movilizará the state, and that is concederán to the Société du grand Paris as advances the project," we can reading in the exposure of motives.
The SGP would not sorprende this system.
"at the beginning of the moment in that are created (the two income taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years, and then receive the 4.000 million later, according explicamos."
"is registrará in the budget and to be used in a function of the needs."
The SGP estimates that empecerá to receive the 4 million in 2013 budget for the 2014.
This dispositivo, in which the 4 million promised not figure in the credit, may lead to a parliamentarian slightly raging debate.
The first sesión public will be the December 7.
Vengadores hackers and espías diligentes
The Wikileaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand, desvela a scandal apparent, a scandal that so solo seems scandal to hypocrisy that currently governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, anuncia profound changes to scale and international prevé a future dominated by the regresión.
But vayamos step-by-step.
The first aspecto WikiLeaks' is the confirmation of the fact that each expediente created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which pertenezca) is shaped solely by cuts press.
The "extraordinary" revelaciones us about the sexual mores of Berlusconi so solo reflect what has been escrito since ago meses in any excepto the paper (that pertenecen to Berlusconi) and the profile of siniestramente ridiculizador Khadafi takes a long time while ideas to the artists who to create their sketches.
The rule according to which the expedientes secret so solo must be composed of news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If visita a bookstore devoted to esotéricas publications, will work that each repite (on the grial, the mystery of rennes-le-château, the templarios or the rosacruz) exactly what had been escrito in the previous works.
This is not only to debe perpetrators of ocultistas texts are not do research inéditas (or not SEPA where to seek novedades about what inexistente), but because those dedican the ocultismo not so solo believe in what already saben, which reconfirma that which had already aprendido.
Here is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies to the expedientes secret.
The informador is lazy, like that is (or lazy has little ansia), the head of the secret services (if not, what I could ser sé, redactor of libération), which only considera true what can reconocer.
The top secret that Berlusconi information about the American Embassy enviaba of Rome to the State Department was the same as the publicaba Newsweek week earlier.
So why have caused such revuelo revelations of these expedientes?
On the one hand, so solo say what every person home-grown national already knows, i.e., that embassies, at menos since World War II, and from that heads of states can llamarse telephone or coger the plane to meet to cenar, have lost their function and diplomatic, save for some exercises limited of representation, have given way to centers of espionage.
Any espectador vea movies of research that it sabe perfectly, so solo aparentamos that did not knowing for hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact to repeat it publicly infringe the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad imagen of US diplomacy.
Second, the idea that a hacker anyone can consult secrets secretos more of the world's most powerful country considerably prestigio affects the State Department.
Thus, the scandal concerns both to the victims and the "executioners."
But entremos in the true nature of what has happened.
Antiguamente, at the time of Orwell, could concebirse to all power as a big brother which controlled every gesture of their subjects.
The prophecy of Orwell has grown reality since, or control every movement thanks to the telephone, every compromise, been conducted hotel, autopista tomada, the citizen is convertía of this way in a complete victim of an eye of power.
But when it demuestra, as it does not even now, that the criptas of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the relationship of control ceases to be unidireccional and becomes move.
The power controls to each citizen, but each citizen (at least the hacker, elected as the vengador of citizens) can conocer all the secrets of power.
How can aguantarse a power that can no longer nor retain their own secrets?
True, as already decía Georg simmel, that a true secret is a secret empty (and a secret empty jamás can be desvelado); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a secret empty, without secret, because that procede realm of public desvelar; but, as has hecho WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means removing all power.
WikiLeaks not has done daño any to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it does, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this herida caused to power as a powerful?
It is obvious that, in the future, states will no longer be able poner on the Web no information reserved, because that be as public in a poster in full calle.
But it is also clear that, with the current technologies, one cannot expect maintain talks confidential by telephone.
Nothing is easier to discover that if and when a head of state has been in desplazado plane and it has become in contact with one of the peers.
How can mantener in the future relations private and proprietary?
I know very well that, for the moment, my forethought is a thing of science fiction and, therefore, novelesca, but I imagino to government agents that is desplazan way discreta in diligencias with itinerarios uncontrollable, carrying mensajes that have been aprendido of memory, as much, or hiding some escritos data in the tacones of their shoes.
This information is conserva then, in a single copia, in cajones closed with llave: at the end of the day, the attempt spy's Watergate had less éxito that WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology currently avanza as a cangrejo, i.e., backwards.
A century after the telégrafo without cables has revolucionado communications, the Internet has returned to create a telégrafo with cables (phone).
The cintas of, (analógicas) were allowed to researchers filmmakers study a movie by degrees, avanzando and retrocediendo, descubriendo all the secrets of the Assembly, while the cd (now digital) so only allow avanzar or back of chapter in chapter, i.e., to huge proportions.
With high-speed railway, we can go of Rome to Milan in three hours, while in plane, with the desplazamientos that entails, we need horas three and a half.
Thus, is nothing outside of the normal that politics and communications to the US lleven of new cars caballos.
A final comentario.
Antiguamente, the press trying to understand what is tramaba secretly in embassies.
Today, they are embassies the piden confidencial that information to the press.
Climate: the chapuzas of France in their promises of financing
A year after the Copenhagen agreement, it is time to examine whether have been respetado promises of financing quickly desbloqueadas (llamadas fast start or precoces) conducted by developed countries.
And the French have been desvelado chapuzas.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $20-30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed to provide 7.200 million euros in three years and France 1.260 million euros (i.e., 420 million per year).
During the opening of the cop16, the EU has put on the table cartas its best to convince their partners that its commitment to the financiaciones fast start is real: a report detallando measures of its member states, a waterwheel press, a great complementary event, the distribution of folletos …
The operation transparencia result apreciable and was apreciada by what really vale: developing countries and civil society that would all developed countries hiciesen the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU has liberado advertises 2010 2.200 million euros, which the sitúa in the good path toward fulfilling its commitment 7.200 billion in 2012.
But, if estudiamos the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen agreement, the money must be "new and adicional" to ensure that realice a complementary effort, without damaging to the official development assistance.
Unfortunately, has not been llegado to an agreement on what it means "new and adicional."
When the European Commission proposed a harmonization, some member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, each chooses the referencia that most fits him.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference the year 2009: stays the international financing and añaden 150 million in three years in concept of financing fast start.
Other countries have chosen references similar in as for the year or at the level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France regards the financing of "all the new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and adicionales."
In other words, are not reference to expenses of previous years nor the level of the total official development assistance.
In concrete, the cuantía total aid of France to developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), while seeks to ensure that respects its commitment in terms of "new funds and adicionales …"
Another crucial element, the sharing among grants and loans.
Once again, there is no norm, and each chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that every euro borrowed amounts to a euro donado.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects, associated with cutbacks in emissions that rely on technologies more effective), it is falaz present a euro that is to recuperar as equivalent to a euro Dona … as much, so only should be computar their commitments for the cost of borrowing for the country concede that the loan (i.e., the equivalent to a kind of interest).
But France not useful such reasoning: "play by" their commitment from 420 million euros doing a 91,5% of préstamos (389,8 millones of €) and a 8,5% of donaciones (36,1 millions of euros); the consulte documento of the ue Para verlo por sus propios ojos.
This is the only país of the Union that uses so frecuentemente lending.
In Germany utiliza 46%, while countries bajos Denmark, or Slovakia, among others, honor its commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when most of the European Union provides a euro to honor its commitment, France alone adds ten céntimos and believes that the effort is comparable.
A neat trick!
In short, in its financiación fast start, France performs a double abuso: on the one hand, in relation to the actions in time and, on the other hand, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending alone 36,1 millones of euros, consigue Dar la impresión of que gasta 420 million additional nuevos "and", as había prometido TAL.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that is bercy who has been ocupado of arbitrage) could have a negative impact double, both within the EU (why iban the other member states to continue to donando when may simply lend?) as in negotiations, because that developing countries are not idiots …
The capítulo of financing precoz is a minucia, relatively short-term, in relation to the set of negotiations on climate.
But it may be a grain of arena of more in the vast maquinaria that is the cmnucc.
Let us hope that not happen.
Whether what trickle, it is indispensable learn from this first year of financiaciones precoces.
First, France could announce a change in their method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention to respect their commitments and the same way that the remaining countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could make avanzasen debates about the stakes in stake in relation to the funding to long-term (another capítulo essential that is currently being debated): not US libraremos of the issue of additional "or" character of the method to computar lending.
France could change its position to become so progresista in relation to this issue as it is with others.
For both, we hope of the new environment minister, the señora kosciusko-morizet, that will reach the Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement on fast the start of France and about their view of the "character additional" and use of the loans would contribute to improve the level of international confianza needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Advertencia about the pesticidas ingeridos by children
A child of 10 years ingiere in a day 81 sustancias chemical different indica, according to a study published the miércoles by the Association générations futures (the old movement and respect for the rights of future generations).
The partnership, which advierte that their results "does not have a significant value statistical considering the limited number of muestras analyzed, but are ilustrativos of the problemática treated," adquirió in supermercados of oise between Paris and julio and September the food that usually consumir a child of a ten years in four meals, and a tentempié the day.
These comidas taken as a model, which respecting the recomendaciones official (five parts of fruits and verduras fresh, three of products lácteos and $1.5 litros agua per day), así as golosinas plants, fueron examinadas in Los laboratorios in busca of sustancias químicas, pesticidas, metals, and pesados otros contaminantes.
The balance of Plato is overwhelming: 81 sustancias chemical, of which 42 clasificadas as possible cancerígenos or probables and five drugs clasificadas as cancerígenos safe, as well as 37 sustancias susceptible to act as perturbadores endocrinos (pe), according to the various studies of international institutions as the center of research on the cancer.
Although ", in virtually all of the cases, is not superan legal limits for each sustancias of chemical individually, our study shows clearly that the exposure of consumers to pollution possibly cancerígenos and / or pe is worrying," says the partnership.
For breakfast, the mantequilla and the té with dairy contienen by their own more than a decena of residuos cancerígenos possible and three considerados as cancerígenos safe, as well as close to a veintena of residuos that can damage the system hormone.
The manzana, importada of Brazil, scheduled for tentempié as the beginning of school, contains six indicating traces of chemicals, including a fungicida forbidden in France.
The same applies to the judías green of Kenya, including in the food, in which the study has detected indicating traces of a powerful insecticida banned in the EU.
Moreover, the filete Russian, tuna in lata, and even the barra of bread or the chicle estaban aderezados with pesticides and other chemicals.
In water, the analysis of the grifo discovered the presence of nitratos and cloroformo.
In the dinner, the rodaja salmon was the more "nutritiva" with 34 residuos chemical detectados, and even the análisis Plato's plastic used to calentar food in the microondas was not completely clean.
The final risk that generate these "cócteles of pollution" for the consumidor "is likely subestima," says the study.
The Alliance EUROPA ecología-les verts (ee-lv), for his part, has proposed "vis-à-vis the gravity of the situation" pursue a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the rise of the diseases asociadas to civilization."
In July, a study of the agencia European security alimentaria (aesa) indicated the presence of residuos of 365 pesticidas different identified in the fruit and the verdura consumidas in Europe, of which 76 in grains.
