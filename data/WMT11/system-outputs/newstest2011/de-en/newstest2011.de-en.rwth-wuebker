What they do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague, Voldemort neither know nor the "Konditorei".
The new Council of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will have to overcome language barriers, it appears that some of their old new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and to be able to understand in the town of representation at all.
The newspaper has Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council of the ČSSD a little "cut off", as they dominate the notorious slang that has become popular in recent years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm.
The encoded vocabulary, which was introduced in the verflossenen era of Mayor Pavel Bém Prague by the political elite, some of the best-known actors, borrowed from situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to the fall into these new concepts somewhat in the dark.
The claim they at least.
"Anyone who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am a newcomer in the Prague policy", Lukáš Kaucký, the new President of the Council for Culture, the test of the "Godfather" vocabulary.
But also the Council, Mr Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way.
For example, the term 'golf hole ".
"This is the only expression of those who put me here, I use every now and then."
"Otherwise, I do not think much of slang."
From the lexicon, which was published in the journal Aktuálně.cz days in this year's June before the election of the ODS congress, the editorial pickte six concepts, especially those that are associated with the notoriously Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats, the terms "Voldemort" Prague, "the greatest golf hole ,"" go into the Konditorei ," "bull neck ,"" treason "and" the capital verblechen define ".
Prague three gentlemen of the Council agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the head of the Prague school system - the first promised his participation in the conversation, not pick up the phone.
The fifth of the Council, Mr Petr Dolínek, rejected the test in advance.
"These are things I don't care, and how to maintain the Civic Democrats, that I am not passing judgement."
"For me, it is important, as we understand us in our programs ," he responded.
As indicated, would not Lukáš Kaucký in the abovementioned headline claim that the influential businessman and friend of the former Lord Mayor Bém, is Janoušek novel.
The term "Voldemort" Kaucky says nothing at all and the only word that he erriet correctly, the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnels ," says Kaucký, added to the security but added:" But I know more from the newspaper. "
And jokingly: "I will have to show a language course. "
"the golf hole "will not only of matador Karel Březina deciphered, but also by the Council, Commissioner for the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as Blanka tunnel.
Both Democrats also know, however, for whom the term Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý knows even when this figure and also what it means to "go in the Konditorei".
"I believe, that is, to go into any Prague catering operation ," Plachý is close to reaching a solution to the problem, when we know that this is the headquarters of Janoušeks firms.
In line with Březina claimed he accessed on this knowledge, but rather from the newspaper, that it would be this vocabulary.
Judging from the test participants, there seems to be among the Social Democrats actually no similar naturalisations slang.
"I have asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such a thing for us."
"We call upon us, and we use the acronym or nicknamed", says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party comrades colloquially" Hulda ."
"At school I was Bříza (birch), but I do not know whether to call me my colleagues ," tells us Karel Březina his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried out the name and behold - it works.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council Weinert is for the party comrades friendly "grandfather" or less friendly to the "old", the Representative Miroslav Poche, who made before the elections by party machinations in sponsorship attention, some colleagues' Igráček "(well-known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are the only one that allow the Social Democrats, whose language.
Hulínský may not claim, "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of Prague.
His nickname "Doctor of rubber truncheons rights" has to do with the fact that allegedly acquired Petr Hulínský his title Doctor juris in the Bratislaver police academy.
The government wants the torture of "witches", and a brochure,
Women who are branded as witches in Burkina Faso, usually some common social characteristics.
They are among the older generation, they cannot find work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women to witch "," will be isolated, so that they can't the rest of the village.
"Men are affected by this fate rare."
"The young and healthy women is spared this, because they are at work and help give birth to children ," describes a sister nuns who cares about the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a Spezialheim by more than a hundred women who were expelled from their communities.
The local government decided, against these abnormal "social action".
And for this reason, a brochure that the "witch hunt".
The matter has a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read ," said the newspaper" standard "on the dilemma of the written information.
To be accused of witchcraft is, but also in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, was tortured, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová of three women and two men to death - they doused with kerosene and setting them.
About this incident, including the BBC server.
The alleged perpetrators, however, the matter would have been just an unfortunate combination of circumstances.
According to their version is inflamed oil, which will be used to Salbungen ritual.
And, after the group was trying to "an evil spirit" of the "cure".
The isolation of "witches" support the people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso, "Fresserinnen human souls are used as a threat ," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso, at least, to defuse the witch hunt, has mitgemischt the gambianische President last year, the President himself.
"President Yahya Jammeh revived after the death of his aunt, a monstrous witch hunt, because those allegedly responsible for the death and would try to kill the president himself through black magic."
He called "a shaman from nearby Guinea to aid that accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the bodyguard of President indiscriminately arrested men and women from villages gambianischen kidnapped and brought to the Farm in Kanilai", the organisation Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm were forced from prison people to drink an Absud from plants with halluzinogener effect, but also of the bowel and kidney problems.
Two of the arretierten people survived not stay on the farm.
It was only on the basis of international pressure were released nearly a thousand prisoners.
The tenants of Bakala: it is an appeal in the oven - but pays higher rent
An older man untersetzter leaves the clients of the center of the society RPG Byty "coal Barons" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental housing in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm of a file with three new rental contracts to three apartments, for their own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who is serving a prison sentence.
All three were in the framework of the so-called "deregulation" increased the rent.
Instead of SEK 3500 monthly rent to fork the son next year for a 2 bedroom apartment with kitchen in the second category 4100 kroner.
"There is no heat in the apartment, fluent in hot water and a simple coal fireplace, if he angered the finger at the new rental agreement's son, he has signed a power.
"But what I saw signed ," he explains upset half and half resigned.
The citizens association Byty $url {OKD.cz}, the new rental conditions as "illegitimate and immoral," advises the tenants to sign new contracts and until 7 December to wait when it intends to publish guidance as to how things are proceeding against such contracts.
But the man to win only.
"It says, the other", he makes a benighted face.
The Ostrava region will be a large "deregulation" laboratory.
After the New Year is this deregulation most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants pay no rent marketable.
Aktuálně.cz decided, therefore, this "laboratory" to visit in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday packed.
Right next to the door of the bodyguards of a security agency and a call.
"Rent" 2011, is a special Tastfeld on the touch screen.
Briefly touched upon and disgorge the device a list of numbers.
We barely have the number "157" and piepst deciphered them on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting area.
Half a hour later, the series.
A little later an older couple walks into the waiting room to ask after the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting room is apparently not even the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the problems, repairs, insurance and so on.
From the middle of November fly in Ostrava region of the Kuverts with new rental contracts with most of the tenants out of a total of 44.000 homes in the portfolios of the RPG in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes them in the letter, a rent increase from about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counters for the new rent clients in the centre is open since 18 November.
"The action is just over a week, that is to say, this is just the beginning", the women behind the counter after a moment of hesitation, as the "client", as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas former miners' homes are a hot topic.
Before the elections had taken up the Ostrava originating from Parliament Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of them.
"Twenty years I want a new floor."
"Not even ne besch. Wc glasses were able to change it ," the man I mentioned earlier.
Until now, the staff, especially pensioners on counters, in order to see whether they receive the promised moderation really tenants, which promises RPG when they enter the supply of specialist in time.
The benefit of a half of February reduced rent will come from the other tenants, the new rental agreement until 15 December to sign.
Until now, "deregulation" counters in Havířov but everything else, overloaded than demand.
"Yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of this ," officials estimate the counters.
Rpg offered both on their Web sites, as well as wall panels individual rental agreements, where it is needed.
Should the rent parties but the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, it is the only possible and legitimate legal approach ," said RPG on its Web sites.
"No one is in court ," says one of the staff of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center gives it at least partly right.
"I have (13.000 kroner), of which 5.000 stay with me for dinner, where should I find the money for a court dispute ," he says.
Then the employees but uncertain.
"Let us see."
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people are still waiting for ," she warns.
The rent regulated ends in most of the Czech Republic to the New Year 2011 and RPG Byty according to the rent increase an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rent is not clear to the maintenance of the housing fund ," said Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of society RPG Byty - and the resentful of tenants, neglect of the housing fund is the homeowners the main reason for the increase in rent.
While RPG could invest in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rents collected four billion in homes, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 will be 5.2 billion.
At the großformatigen LCD display on the ceiling of the cushion bellies in the waiting room of Havířov appear to keep a few brilliant red information.
"The rent increases in 2011 at 15% and 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of RPG."
"Always means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square metre and month ," is to read on the LCD screen.
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG increased the rent at 38 percent.
"In these cases is the increase in extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre ," argues RPG.
In 2600, the rent next year on the same amount.
Rpg Byty promises that the deregulation of the skyrocketing rents, but gradually within four and eight years.
What's more, given the company a further commitment: all revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back into the homes, especially in heat savings - in new windows and insulation.
But, as a priority should be given to those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw a - the office is also a nursery school
The office buildings Avriopoint in Brno, the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini nursery, with all this: farbenfrohen walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the terrace.
This nursery is since last year, the staff of Arch.Design available.
The study and architecture office Arch.Design, come from the Ateliers a number of prominent Brünner buildings, expected by the first drafts of the new building Avriopoint on the premises for his firms mini nursery.
Wise in, because most of its 90 staff (inside) are in the baby boom ages and the company is that the Projektantinnen and Architektinnen as quickly as possible to their jobs.
Together with the possibility of shortening the work of the nursery, is another bonus, has to offer the Arch.Design its employees in the concept of social program.
The Bauingenieurinnen and architektinnen have it easier, demanding their profession and to bring the child welfare.
The mini nursery is an original idea of the staff (internal) by Arch.Design and with the support of management succeeded in aid of the European Union and of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs for their project.
The occupational mini nursery is financed by the operational programme, human resources and employment policy from the European Social Fund and from the state of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants of $2, 8 million CZK) could be obtained the necessary facilities and equipment and for the duration of 2 years for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the absorption of funds (2 years) is committed to the society Arch.Design to operate the mini nursery 3 years at their own expense.
The preparation of this project, a whole year, and the society Economy rating in the processing of aid.
The children who ganztätig qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten lesson Rin, the kindergarten children can visit without altersmäßige restrictions, although most of them are about three years old.
And since this is a mini nursery, at the same time, only 5 children, however, alternating periods of the day on several children each other.
The nursery operation is tailored to the needs of parents, the children of all staff have in relation to the use of the nursery equal rights, regardless of the corporate hierarchy and their position.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini nursery nevertheless comparable with the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children play not only here, above all, offering them an excellent teaching - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, by the way they learn English.
The classroom is not only with creative toys and games, but also with a computer, the children.
What's more, the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive business environment.
The parents can always look at the children and so the stress in the late Abholen children from a faraway kindergarten.
The parents take advantage of their working time more productive.
No wonder that emerge here also natural and loyal industrial relations.
Arch.design introduced so under the Czech companies that offer the recruitment of new staff clear Benefits, family-friendly and encourage such programmes through their staff.
A bone House fascinated even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi to
The roof seems to like the back of a prehistoric Echse, the stairs as the vertebral column of a Dinosauriers and the Balkone are past Fischmäuler.
This is the Batlló Casa of the Catalan architect, Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The local inhabitants of the house, with its organic forms the nickname "bone house".
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, and Kachelsplittern mosaic, the scales, raising the spectre of facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all of which are standard features for the youth of Antonio Gaudi style.
The facade of the House plays with beautiful lines, colors and Texturen lack force, recalling the nature and living things.
First, on closer inspection that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful.
On the night the whole facade of plastic, even more dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforces the luster of the colours.
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms dominate the interior of the house.
Parliament spouting out waves geformtes copied the wooden window frames, parapets, Zierelemente by doors, even Guck holes and services.
The House Batlló in the quarter Eixample along the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by converting a house in 1877, said the architects Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but eventually he agreed with the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper to reconstruction.
The rental house Casa Batlló Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together.
On the drawing board the Dekorationen representative apartment for the realities of the owner and the use of mosaics of the facade was his idea.
In the design of the facade, but also many other Bildner and artists.
The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
So Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís house Casa Milá in the Güell Park, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Not long after its completion, the house of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nickname "bone house".
Others called it a special Fensteröffnungsmechanismus due to the "yawning house".
It also says, at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, of the barons of Catalonia.
But other elements bildhauerische symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí devised for the House for the time Zentralheizungssystem with unique ventilation channels and typical Kaminen.
Something seems bizarre their propensity to 45 degrees.
His creation Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes and not be led astray by them.
Before the start of construction, he of the city's planning permission, but he said details of the planned reconstruction were so vague that horrified the city fathers two years later with the completion of the result that they demanded.
The gentlemen of the Council, among other things, that the construction intervened with its pillars in the public pavement.
The changes were not more, on the contrary, only fifteen days after the invitation of the city area, Josep Batlló a request for approval of the rental of the two höchstgelegenen floors of the House - and it was granted him promptly.
The homeowners themselves, in the lower floors.
In the gallery in the 2th floor was a social showroom, in the third floor of the bedroom and private rooms of the house.
The ground floor has been leased to a jeweller business.
The whole sechsstöckige buildings going through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the placements were eliminated all right-wing corner and alternate lines and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls.
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual connection between rooms.
The social part of the opening of the showroom doors completely, and it was while a larger society convenient, without having to give up on vertraulicheren talks on a certain intimacy.
The house was given by Gaudís conversion to a new facade is a very unusual roof and two other floors.
Impressively is also Gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasierten Kacheln which is dressed in the courtyard and the light.
The game of the two colours gives all the floors of the House to light.
In doing so, he made it plain the principle that reflects the white light better than dark colors, which absorb sunlight, on the contrary.
The House Batlló Casa, which was incorporated in 2005 in the world heritage list of Unesco, everyone can visit today.
In the first floor is the geräumigste and prächtigste housing accessible to the public.
The firm homeowners only in the years to do this and that on the occasion of the 150 .Geburtstags of the famous designer.
As pointed out that this is a very profitable business, retained the inspections, they will be extended to other common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price for the inspection of the monument is not chicken feed, he is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, and groups of tourists cards received 20 percent reduction.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to learn the real atmosphere of the House, with its Drachentürmchen, should try to make friends with one of the House, and visit him at home.
The right and the right mattress beds rust? Women have other things than men
The tollste bed frame, but the quality of the mattress deck area - rust and make the bed.
They must complement each other harmoniously, however, in order to meet the wishes of the actual user.
In choosing to play a role in many cases, the weight, the size of the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers.
Equally important is the Interieur, which have to mattress and rust.
A typical example?
In a weekend house in which will not heated regularly, are not Latex mattresses, as they need much longer, "warm".
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual Polyurethan mattresses.
And they should be changed regularly.
If they are not sufficient Entlüftungskanälchen at heart and still have to be a solid record, movement of moisture: It is not excluded that emerges from the mold.
In the election, of course, also plays a role, which is used to be.
Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with Weichschicht, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"All ice hockey players who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they cannot sleep more correctly."
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and waists, they need a Weichschicht from Visco sparkling (Memory Foam - a form of memory Polymer)."
"I recommend including diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" information "from the ligaments and skin badly ," said Sylva Hadamcziková who specialised in padded furniture.
That is why I have many years ago ice hockey players, but also other customers, with Visco foam mattresses (Memory Foam).
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And we must not necessarily be a famous ice hockey players, the benefits of the Visco surfactants estimate.
This "miracle" actually works quite simple.
The sparkling optimalisiert his toughness and form the heat absorbed, in other words, he schmiegt itself, the warm body.
Nowhere is there, in the middle of the night shifts are not around as after a major battle.
We simply sleeping much better.
The viskoelastische sparkling also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene).
In the election of the mattress size should add to body size is still the length of the foot soles, or about 21 to 34 cm.
As Mrs Mann, who are 180 cm tall, so a 210 to 220 cm bed.
Each of the sleepers should be at least 90 cm deck width available, 180 cm.
In separate beds, for example, in singles, 120 to 140 cm.
For the sake of comfort and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bed width: "If you remain on the back, should be enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms ," advises Ing. Prokopová Helena, the guild champion of the Polsterer and Raumausstatter who, for years the issue of healthy Schlafes and the ergonomics of furniture, and then put this issue to the schools.
In a double bed everybody needs its own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping for a mattress so high.
Otherwise we have no choice but to Roste in differing degrees to install and it is not every bed frame.
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton 15 cm, should account for at least three centimetres in the form of class and fine cushion.
"With the hand or placing may feel the feathers under any circumstances ," warns Prokopová Helena.
Every mattress makes a special type of rust.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as of Siam twins have to be found in the bedroom.
These mattresses and cannot reveal the reference can wash what today already.
And since you lose in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years, slowly to a huge (and congested sieve).
Experts also reject advertising slogans, the mattress with a lifespan of up to 25 years, or even a lifetime guarantee.
Every case has its ifs and buts.
And that is why a practical advice from dealers: mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width of the hygiene of the waschbaren, not abziehbaren salary, however, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, and wash it easily.
Even if they are made in the mattress salary with Rundumreißverschluss, so you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machines size!), is the manipulation with larger mattresses, above all, how often the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
They are in bed instead of a Rostes a record?
In order to get out!
Or, at most, for a bed for unpopular guests and for a single night.
It should also provide them the record with ventilation holes (if not included) and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with the Taschenfederkern and fine cushion.
Polyurethan mattresses are not in such a document.
For not verstellbare standards Roste with 14 to 18 (the last Lamellen) are Latex or sandwich mattresses (possibly also combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay themselves Roste with a larger number of standards, from 28 or more in services, with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the tough standards.
On verstellbare Lamellen Roste are no mattresses with the skeleton, because they do not respond to the workplace disguise.
In addition to the suspension of the Steife pen to be offered special flexible shoulder modules.
This is a special fastening the services that makes it possible einzudrücken the pen, or verwinkeln so that they allow the specific Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers.
Especially for men with broad shoulders, an important matter.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started, "gentlemen mattresses' Weichzonen for the shoulder area.
Also in the ladies - is intended to give these Weichzonen in the Hüftgegend.
For ambitious customers are punktelastische Flügelfedersysteme (Lattoflex) or Roste with punktelastischen Pads contact with the Multitorsionsfederung.
The pressure will be distributed to several points, reducing the tension.
But - if the right mattress and rust right a bad (too large and fülliges) used pillow, most of the benefits.
Here too, a rule of thumb: the pillow to prop up the head, his top should extend only to the shoulders, so that we can relax the shoulder muscles.
The ideal is a 50 x 60 cm deep cushions, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians.
In the pages of the pillow (along with the Schulterentlastungszone rust or in the Weichzone in the mattress) make up the back.
Some of our modern mattresses, with the former (hay and straw bags packed) but in common.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least their mixtures.
Also in mattresses says the new magic word "organic".
Instead of oil raw materials used in the manufacture of Polyurethan foaming increasingly naturelle oils - for example, Rizinus and soya oil.
Soya is used well known by all manufacturers.
"Organic mattresses, which is to say their nuclear materials from purely natural ," said Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus.
Naturstoffe but also be used in the production of mattress salaries - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
You can take but also micro capsules, which spread the sleeping fresh forest or Lavendelduft.
Here, too, makes a difference between a man and a woman.
While the men "kühlender" is used plant extracts from birch leaves, so that the mattress to absorb the heat and cool the body, can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect.
Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate the blood circulation, the weaker sex is sleeping in the wohlig so warm.
And today's favorite?
Mattresses from Kaltschaum (he has greater Poren with destroyed cell structure and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard Polyurethan and much more flexible).
The combination of the various Steife (severity) of Kaltschäumen and Visco foaming create additional zones mattresses, who know exactly where to head, hip and heels.
For a quality mattress, but 7000 kronor and fork.
Gesundheitsmatratzen but usually are burdened with lower value added tax, as they apply as medical devices.
The first Czech companies was Gumotex this advantage.
You can see, the mattress and not to save the rust is so easily.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers who offer two for the price of a mattress.
So the brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze with in the verstepptem Visco sparkling Memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second you get free of charge.
It was the Tempur material that launched the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open cell structure and high density in almost kosmischem pace.
No wonder, but they have been developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to the launch of enormous excessive impositions.
Tempur will heat soft, entrenched in a cool environment it in turn.
So it fits perfectly in the human body and distributed on the best way the body.
It is therefore not only an ideal for the prevention of fire, but increased pressure generally sleep comfort.
Viskoelastische sparkling substances are not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as, for example, used in particular Fußpolstern, allowing the legs and the vessels.
Domestic manufacturers use the sparkling substances Eucatherm C, Twin Saver or similar products.
More and more parents want people controls, in order to have the kids under control
The fear for their own children grow and consider more and more parents to monitor them via GPS.
The system that was originally invented to tracking down cars that can travel is just as well, would also be helpful in such cases, such as Janatková spurlosen recently in the disappearance of the nine-year Anička.
The device is about as big as a packet of cigarettes but soon may not be greater than a wristwatch.
Many people in the case of the missing Anička and as they consider ways and means looking to protect their children.
For the price of a violation of their privacy.
"We are trying to say that this is not Herumspionieren, but an effective means to reduce the likelihood that there will be a tragedy," Petr Pilin by society Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that it can come in individual cases of abuse of such devices, for example, if someone is in the pocket, without that he knows, but we had there been no such case."
"Most customers buy it for security reasons ," adds Pilin.
In his view, should know the child but always, what purpose the "box" and how they are used in an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková points out, however, that a child, while it may not be such a thing, it simply abdicating its.
"Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to certain things, if they want to be controlled."
"The mobile phones initially gave birth to the parents' high expectations, but they can be shut down, just as easily, as these new controls ," says Ms Bočková.
It is also questionable whether helps such a facility in the event of an attack.
"The kidnappers planned kidnappings controlled virtually always whether the child has any electronics, which could be located."
"Today is the mobile phone."
"If such controls would look for wider use, they also, as it would be accompanied by massive advertising sales safe."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead ," says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that may be similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile helped.
Roberta Čech by society RC monitoring, according to the tracking services for both cars, as well as for people who can help the existence of such equipment, even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can adjust that it plays the position in certain intervals."
"Even if it were to be destroyed immediately, at least the final position of the person concerned."
"The more expensive equipment is even a tendency knife, that is, if you hinfällt motionless and breaks down, the device sends a warning for the position ," said Mr Čech.
In his view could carry out similar services also smart phones with navigation, einzuspielen only a special software.
The problem with the current positioning devices is that this is either in matchbox size, supporters are similar to or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk that they will lose.
Mr Pilin of the Macro Weil, according to testing in the present devices that look like ordinary digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that do not recognise the potential attackers at all that it is a surveillance and tracking equipment.
"He notes that only after a certain period of time, which gives the police a head start ," he adds.
No matter what the direction of development - to Armbändern or supporters, always use the same technology, such as the vehicle tracking.
The combination of positioning function with the help of the GPS system (as well as in the case of Ms in the car) and the role of a mobile phone, which reports the current position.
The army has so many detonators that could umwickeln quite the Czech Republic, but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres detonators, detonated with bombs.
In the previous year had supplied the Ministry of Defence, 224 kilometres but because of the army camp.
It is reassuring to know that ausgesorgt the armed forces for 225 years.
The problem is the durability of the detonators - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the detonators of the Company STV Group, for example, mere 40 million kroner.
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge amount, but because of the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would consume annually, but because of the 60 kilometres.
Research by the army Pyrotechnikern, according to the MF raised DNES, comes from the fact that the army is a very intensive pyrotechnic education - by all the generals and officers of the army commandos, to the secretaries and women.
The defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army General Vlastimil Picek.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres Zündschnüren halfway.
The length of calls for 25.000 Detonationen.
But it also would extend this army stocks for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts that are sufficient for the training of each new professional soldiers two metres but because completely, then the army by these Neueinkäufe - in the light of the increased needs of pioneering and special forces - created a reassuring stock for the already mentioned in 225 years.
The soldiers complained of Schnelleinsatzbrigade recently at the Defense Minister Vondra, they had almost no cartridges for small arms, so that more are almost certainly being restricted because of the lack of funds.
Not to mention the lack of trousers.
"I am not a, why they buy from us such huge detonators."
But that is their decision, they will know that what they need them. "
"For us, the army has been a good customer, we want to get as much as possible against traffickers ," says the manager of the STV Group Děcký Jan.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence will present the purchase of hundreds of kilometres, but because the army had been so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" eingedeckt.
Jan Děcký from the STV Group speaks only of the duration of the four-year utility detonators and police and army Pyrotechniker only two years.
"The perfect storage are also mentioned in the four years of", one of them, which wants to remain unnamed, but not as a soldier accused the criticism of the army.
After the expiry of the duration of use must be tested thoroughly any ammunition, whether it is reliable and does not threaten the lives of the soldiers.
These tests are not in vain, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Defense Department is the amount of the rebate for 445 km but because.
"It cost us sixty percent less than the letztjährige delivery of 244 kilometres ," says spokesman Pejšek the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren by the police, Pyrotechnikern liquidate the munitions from the Second World War or the Soviet army's brother, a few years, barely 1.500 metres.
And the police are always such quantities of ammunition, which they can use up before the end of the utility.
The safety of the Pyrotechniker because, in addition, we have the opportunity to flexible purchases more modern and reliable detonators.
The Ministry of Defence has huge problems relating to the winding-up of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when preparing the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak People's Army on their campaign on the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnikern, raised the MF DNES, expects the Czech armed forces in a few years ago, the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old detonators, which today as "good" has bought.
To this day, I have the contacts I have won the competition
The victorious placement in the competition "small entrepreneurs of the Year" helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of the franchise's hotels.
The winner of last year, the "small entrepreneurs of the year" Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The history of his success as a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun traveled.
Only abroad was aware that it is lacking in Liberec good wondering at reasonable prices.
From the savings of its holiday work abroad and with the help of a loan from a bank he emerged a baufälliges house with five homes.
Considering that he was an university student in the sixth term, this was certainly a daunting challenge.
"The original price relationship quality angered me and so I tried to do something about it ," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
The profit, he immediately back into the house, which he then step by step to pension with 54 beds umbaute.
Since then, succeeded him in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec four pensions, two stilgerechte restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The komfortabelste of them was until recently the Viersternehotel "Pytloun design hotel".
This year was another first-class hotel.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties on the franchise Pytloun hotels have already ," says the operator number one last year.
"A large proportion of the licence sales on the operation of hotels had the victory in the competition" entrepreneur of the year, "adds Mr Pytloun acknowledged.
The victory gave him greater prominence, issued popularity in Liberec and surrounding areas.
"People saw me on the street, often congratulated me even after the event and I must say that it was doing really well ," he recalls.
I commend all those who really want to create something to participate in this competition.
You need to win as well, any visibility is good.
He says that he prefers to date from the contacts and acquaintances, which it would not otherwise.
"With some people who I met thanks to the competition, I am still regular business relations."
The success of glory is reflected in his view, a little in any of his staff.
And since he has the seventy.
"I see them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is the general recognition."
I do not see this as a personal success, no, this is the result of good work by all of us. "
"My name is only slightly in the first place ," says Lukáš Pytloun modest.
I wish my successors easier a year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory soon was replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination Farmet has the worst behind them.
The price of the first rank of competition company Vodafone of the year last year, took Žďárský Karel, holders of the firms Farmet.
The jury will honor the efforts, with whom he stampfte from the small tool construction in Česká Skalice a company from the soil, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this commemoration only myself, but also all my staff and has strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition ," says last year's winners.
At the beginning of the corporate history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And then the state as his father, Karel Žďárský as compensation for the Communists confiscated property offered a small workshop on the lease, he did not hesitate for long, his career in the company, in which he was employed by then, ditch and, with a few friends of his father's own company to manufacture plastic tubs.
A short time later began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they are now the largest manufacturer of mechanical presses throughout Central Europe.
But the success in the aforementioned competition and Medialisierung is not aware of the public.
"Not only that our customers to the brand Farmet now clear, our foreign partners began the fact, to work with a firm that has won in their country's greatest success, to attach greater value ," says Karel Žďárský.
The past year was not Farmet but only in the context of the euphoria of victory.
The study was based on the results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of construction products tool.
The crisis that is still less the off-the-cuff citizens, but above all companies, reached their peak - many firms have been forced to suspend their investment projects and reduce purchases of new equipment and technologies.
"This situation could not escape, of course, we also."
"The sales went up by 40 percent, we had to limit the production and even resort to layoffs ," said Karel Žďárský
A viable companies must take sometimes such unpopular measures.
But it was able to get the situation under control and to keep the company in the black figures, although with lower profits than before the crisis.
In the case of a company was not willing to make concessions - investment in research and development.
"from the subsidy we built a research and training center, we encouraged our presentation at international fairs and bought the main domestic prices in exhibitions ," says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing, and with them the number of new staff.
"I wish the new winner much joy of victory - but in more calm," Karel Žďárský gear.
An opinion poll, the clean up with nonsensical rules
The opinion poll for the "absurdity" of the year for the fourth time is part of the business competition.
Some of the rules was able to create the world.
The dubious winner of next year, the poll "absurdity of the year" wake the obligation to create documents to the authorities, are available online.
So, no more than a third of four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs.
It called for the social security administration a paper excerpt from the trade register, even if the officials could have access to two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll this will change now.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will require in the future of Social Security checks of contributors no extracts from the trade register more ," the spokeswoman of ČSSZ Janša Buraová.
The purpose of the poll "absurdity" of the year, it is all rules and regulations, have to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the absurd.
This is earlier this year for the fourth time part of a business competition, the tsch. Economic newspaper (HN) will be held and enjoyed in the public's growing popularity.
If the last year of the three thousand people in the vote, there were four thousand earlier this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations, which serve only to hinder the business.
"As far as, for example, the number of income tax forms, we take a front rank in the world ," said Karel Havlíček by the association of small and medium-size businesses and businesspeople in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the business activity in recent years the proclaimed goal of all governments.
Compared to the world the situation has improved in the Czech Republic, however.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic in terms of business conditions in the 74th grade, compared with the previous year, with eight seats worse placement.
The absurdity of the year has been declared for the first time in years, and plays each year, according to the same scenario.
Everyone can speak from April until the final drafting of competition at the end of September, administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
To register the website address is $url {www.firmaroku.cz}. After that, the organisers of the competition seven candidates for the "price" and the public online on the websites $url {www.firmaroku.cz} and $url {www.ihned.cz} absurdita / vote.
It is a triumph of the absurdity, which gets the most votes.
For this year's poll, more than a hundred, angemeldetVVPP more precisely 105 senseless rules and orders.
The advice comes not only of entrepreneurs, but also by professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "Fina lists" of competition, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles on highways and have to pay toll expressways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, must vorrichten two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, each in early November at the Prague Wenceslas Square is part of a Happenings in which also participate regularly personalities of the political and public life.
This year, for example, Svobodová Eva, the director of the association of small or medium-sized companies and businesspeople. The Tsch Petr Republic and Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Tsch Republic. At the height of the competition on board.
"Where does the state employers spanners in the works, there can be no real recovery, so it is my aim to lift each year at least thirty paragraphs that today's entrepreneurs are unnecessarily their businesses ," said Martin Kocourek, the minister for industry and trade.
The efforts to create the orders from the world, effect.
In 2007, disrupted the people most entrepreneurs the obligation to notify the Office business at the place of their permanent plant three days in advance, with the intention of issuing a reality at an exhibition or drive to Kirmes.
This requirement has been lifted by virtue of a review of the law.
The duty, which received 2007, the second largest number of votes - the obligation to notify the labour office missions of workers in up to 30 days - the law on the so-called "green card".
And - all good things come in threes:
The absurdity of the year 2009 was elected to the regulation which it imposed physiotherapists, speaking in the room with a mirror, a fridge and two people scales.
This regulation was mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year to some extent - the fridge duty fell away.
A new category of socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's is the fifth year of the competition in the economic newspaper (HN) is the category "Verantwortungsbewusste company of 2010".
The basic idea of this competition, it is reasonable and fair ventures.
"We want to support such firms, which are aware of the consequences of your business activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives ," said Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, Ausrufer and guarantor of this competition, as well as" a rebel competition of the year ."
This year's first year of this particular subset of the main competition of the year Vodafon company signed up for the firms, the success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is extremely inspirativ and would provide enough material for a self-employed article.
Although they differ on the subject of their work, their efforts have a common denominator - support and respect.
It is, for example, gehandikapte people, because of personal problems or the health of their own staff.
Among the fourteen Fina lists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software companies Et Netera, which promotes the emergence of formal sports teams under her staff, who will take part in many tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the region Pardubice society is Isolit bravo, seventeen years main sponsor of a gehandikapte Foundation Fund for children.
A paper factory from Poděbrady cares about their health, disabled workers, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, what they called "Verantwortungsbewusste company in the region of Bohemia" was appreciated; Vodafone competition in the company of the year, in the context of this region of the third grade.
In the region Olomouc won the accounting firm MiRyz soft, among other things, and also to an average of 35 hours per week reduced working hours and proportionate to do so without cutting wages.
The jury honorierte title in the award of the fact that the company buy predominantly in Czech manufacturers, citizens' initiatives in their area and works for green principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible, the consequences of our business and administration for the environment as low as possible ," said Ryznarová their manager Miluše.
The responsible Enlogit IT companies from the region Ústí nad Labem, in turn, is worried about the health of its staff and therefore has acquired them all to note Books ergonomics armchairs and keypads, also encourages them to their employees work at home and in corporate actions they used Carte ring services offered by a local sheltered workshop.
"We also support the Foundation" people in need, "which makes the local Roma Kommunität concrete assistance ," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Not least is the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the region Karlsbader worth mentioning that contributes to their employees in the form of extra Bonussen to their pension.
"We give our employees'contributions to the food, for the way to increase their qualifications and for the holidays ," says Josef Strapáč by the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winners in the Mährisch Schlesischen region.
The category Verantwortungsbewusste company of the year were automatically notified all county Fina lists of competition Vodafon company of the year, the beantwortetet the registration of the enclosed questionnaire and post them by 15 .August the organisers.
Wrong or incomplete filled in answers to the questionnaire were excluded from the organisers of the assessment.
"If the representatives of the competing firms the unanswered questions, they were from the competition" Verantwortungsbewusste company of the year "excluded, in the main competition company Vodafone of the year they were disqualified but not."
"A separate application only to this competition is not possible, since it is merely a subset of the company's main competition of the year ," said Karel Goldman of organising the agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner soil funds - arrests by the police at a public tender
In the building of the soil in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police arrests in the last few days.
It has been taken of the European media entrepreneurs and real estate brokers Luboš G. by the Detektiven in handcuffs.
This allegedly tried to manipulate a just a public competition to the settlement of Restitutionsansprüchen so that Koštunica did the competition offered land a specific interests.
This is said to have paid Luboš G. for half a million.
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person convicted of the crime of fraudulent practices in a public competition ," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor of the newspaper," Právo more details could not provide them with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later was released the 46-year-old entrepreneur from the police.
How he was able to manipulate the public competition, we can speculate about the lack of official information.
The spokeswoman of the land fund Lubomír Černá led to the question of Právo, the police have made in the Pilsner antenna of the land fund actually arrests and this during a public competition.
"It was a client and nothing to do with one of our staff ," it was.
The public competition had Mrs Černá, according to the correct name 'call for tenders of claims on the transfer of land in accordance with the law "and would take place in cases where bezeigen several applicants offered interest in the land.
"These people are in the context of a higher value through the transfer to Restitutionsansprüche RAL, proclaimed as the land value."
"In accordance with the requirements laid down the order of the potential acquirer, then gives the fund the land to the person with the highest offer ," said the spokeswoman of the fund.
Luboš G. were apparently information, who had filed the request and because he was justified, since he had bought a number of Restitutionsansprüchen, he offered a real estate interests that he is withdrawing from the competition.
Obviously, against a fat severance pay.
That would also be a sufficient explanation as to why he had to arrest him such a large amount of money.
Luboš G. had in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner soil.
So he played in the issue of the former chief of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he failed to substitute restitution of properties that have been passed already location decisions on construction projects.
At the time Luboš G. acquired the land fund, for example, land intended to build public roads, more precisely, where was the construction of the access to the main route Borské pole industrial area.
Later he exchanged this very favourably with the magistrate directly against a house in the historic centre of the city, which exceeded the value of the properties.
The Kleinbeigeben City Hall had at that time, with a heavy heart, in order not to jeopardise the works by blocking the properties.
The cost of residential households rise by a few hundred per month
Households are not only from January with higher costs for all forms of energy, but also with higher water and sewer fees and for district heating and some grow rents.
Families will have to learn from January, several hundred more kronor per month from the wallet than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive gas at 2 percent and more, in some cities will have to pay for up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places, the district heating supplies.
The electricity prices, the housing budgets every year a few hundred kronor.
The Stark electricity prices were reduced by all the main suppliers, it is clear that the promotion of electricity produced from renewable sources, notably from photovoltaic installations.
Gas will only moderately more expensive, but exactly when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, is to be expected with a few hundred kronor per year.
While electricity and gas in the Czech Republic are more expensive, the price of district heating from city to city.
Above all, more places are planning price increases.
It must pay the households and Pardubice Hradec Králové from January for district heating per month up to 50 kronor, more than 1000 kronor per year pay families in Liberec.
The residents of Prague, in turn, threatening 9 percent higher water and sewer fees and this is the case that the city's infrastructure.
If the rent, there are only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague is compared to the Czech Republic is still among the lowest.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, rising water and sewage charges at 7.4 percent.
Huge rent increases are expected in 140.000 rental apartments, which ended in January, the so-called rent regulation.
So, for example, the housing companies CPI Byty, in Ústí nad Labem 2500 homes to raise rents from January at one hundred percent.
Anyone who is not with the rent increase, wants to prosecute the company.
The regulated rents, which you pay in approximately 300.000 homes, are likely to rise next year by more than 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with Branca beer and rum is out - it is simply too slow
Branca, rum and vodka, for once, a good whisky, has stolen the father of the house from the bar.
These are the drinks, must be notbehandelt after enjoyed Czech drunken teenagers under fifteen most frequently.
No exception are children who need to ausschlafen their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This comes from the experience of doctors, which will be faced with similar cases in the children's wards of hospitals.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it takes too long to be drunk."
"The trend is clearly hard alcohol ," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief doctor of the children's department in the mittelböhmischen Hořovice clinic.
"Whisky, if it is possible to snatch the father a bottle from the House bar, and if not, then at least Branca or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that it can be blended with juice, then he does not smell so strong ," said the chief doctor.
The spokeswoman of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him.
"Most often refers to Branca or rum."
"This is the current trend of alcohol, particularly in primary schools."
"Occasionally, it was also about slivovice, take it from home", Mrs Jurinová.
Chefarzt Pelikán according to thirteen or -year drinkers in the hospital receiving no exception.
Before the clinic in Hořovice, from which he has been working for this year, he was for ten years in the paediatric ward of the hospital, where Motol produced the rescue vehicles angetrunkene pupils from local and long distance.
"A girl had to be hospitalisiert four times."
"She began her career at the age of 12, the first time with 3.5 mg of alcohol in the blood and in combination with" Extase "was taken ," the doctor describing a particularly severe case.
"It was in the exhibition site in Holešovice on any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it was not their mother at all odd that her daughter was 48 hours to go home ," surprised by the chief doctor.
The lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance in the toasts with its own Sprösslingen is seen as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children.
A real dependence in the true sense of the word, it is not, according to experts in children.
"Alcoholism is a longstanding chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon and that is not the case in these children."
Those who have repeatedly alcohol, is mostly a negative in terms of the family social Background characteristic, "said chief doctor Pelikán.
The spokesman for the hospital Motol, Mrs Jurinová, have been admitted by mid-November approximately forty drunken children in the department for our children and youth.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning, which accounted for a hospital stay is required, in the statistics.
Drunken children who are taken to ambulatory treatment from parents or, if necessary, by the police, are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children only as a bottle of spirits in the school austrinken Bank is there, in the view of Mr Pelikán three jahreszeitliche Amplituden, which is totally unreliable: Walpurgisnacht New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either from distress because of the bad certificate or joy at the holidays."
"In the Walpurgisnacht I have already drunk seven children in the host ," said Dr Pelikán.
A betrunkenes child who spend the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off than a child who is the next day with a nasty hangover.
The headaches in the morning, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, which is in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion of glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the body.
"They are clearly better off, because after the" beautiful "experience in the evening, with good humour, without doing something somewhere."
"They are just a little confused about where they are ," admits a doctorate Pelikán, although it is polluting the patients at least sometimes the good humour, by listing them the costs that they will cost the treatment.
Because of the transport with the rescue vehicles and the night in an Akutbett well and to a few tens of thousand kronor.
"Every now and then I have used it as an educational tool, if I have calculated directly to children at the time of the visit, which has cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they need to work on the whole holiday to earn the money for a single such Fete ," added Dr Pelikán.
In his view, not the health insurance companies, however, to redress procedures, the demand for the trunkenen children costs from parents.
Two training aircraft L- 159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two L- 159 light fighter planes out of a total of five, which has replaced the Czech Defense Ministry against the transport plane Casa C- 295 M, are flown on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer EADS Casa - married.
It is the first time that machines of this type in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were only in exercises or air shows.
This is the flugfähige Zweisitzerversion L- 159 T1, which was run by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are einsitzige L- 159.
These are einkonserviert currently in the Aero Vodochody, the facilitator of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over the last week.
When they expediert aircraft physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, yet known.
The einsitzigen fighter plane L- 159, in turn, have been singled out for the long term, these planes without further deposits and investment on the part of the department of the ministry.
"The doppelsitzigen L- 159 T1 were exchanged in current condition and appearance ," said the newspaper Pejšek Právo.
He added that the army will have to do without zweisitzige fighter planes, as the Ministry of Defence signed in May 2009 with 200 million Aero Vodochody a treaty on the conversion of four unnecessary L- 159 to zweisitzigen version.
A new plane, the army in July, the second wants to take it by the end of this year.
According to pejšek has committed itself to EADS, the fighter planes in the equipment of the NATO countries.
"In the Treaty is clearly stated that the company EADS customers of the L- 159 aircraft and that these should be used for training pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer, in what way he realized the matter", Pejšek.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L- 159.
The barter of five L- 159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence had advertised at the time of purchase a tender procedures, but spoke directly to EADS.
The defense argued at the time, this exchange will support the future export of L- 159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which they used only 24, wanted to sell it.
The purchase of aircraft Casa should have, in fact, a legal process.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence, at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have had to select the aircraft on the basis of a ganzeuropäischen tender and not be addressed by a single manufacturer.
The army has taken three aircraft Casa, the last to arrive within fourteen days at the Kbely Airport.
A long finger as a ring finger means a lower risk of contracting cancer
Men, whose long finger, than the ring finger, apparently a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is connected with the levels of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer in men and in particular to sixty ," said the co-author of the study, as Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger so could help to determine which men should necessarily a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Mrs Eeles added.
In the period from 1994-2009, with their counterparts in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study was the finger of the right-hand man shorter than the ring finger.
For these men had the same probability of prostate cancer, accounting for 19% of those men whose ring finger and immediately.
In men, whose finger longer than the ring finger, this risk, however, fell by 33%, sixty men and about 87 percent.
The relationship between the length of the two mentioned, which are already in the prenatal age, apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which was exposed to the baby in the womb.
Less testosterone is a longer finger.
Previous research found that testosterone is accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticists and former chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, he did this study fleetingly aware, nonetheless, he is the relationship between the finger length and the risk of cancer has so far proved to be "completely".

There are three blocked roads still completely: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice Kučerov - and also aratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, will have to be used for snow clearance Schneefräsen.
When will they condition, to assess not until now.
In the region Hodonín is in the field of White Carpathians caution.

American soldiers have a new "smart" weapon.
The American troops in Afghanistan for the first time a new "smart" weapon used, which is so far only under the code name XM- 25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon the conflict with the Taliban and shifts the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is such a thing as a supergenaue gun.
The projectiles are guided by lasers, with an accuracy of just a few metres into the goal.
The specific mm shells of standard 25, which were developed for the gun and contain dangerous explosive, practically as small grenades.
The shells can be programmed so that they are not only on impact on the target, but can explode at any given point of their ballistic trajectories.
In other words, you can use it against an enemy that lurks behind a barrier wall or in the trench.
From the top is not protected, it is usually the murderous Stahlsplitterregen from above can put it so easy to battle.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM- 25, is the new gun battle the first infantry weapon, the "smart" technologies.
"The soldier is basically so: he envisages the objective and sends a Laserstrahl, which determines the distance, he wins a clear aim point, after which he corrected the increase corner, then he needs abzudrücken only.
"Shall we say, has been measured 543 feet."
"If you abdrückt, invites the weapon and the broken on the distance of 543 metres plus minus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs will be transferred
The company Fujitsu shifted his office in Homburg bath to Frankfurt.
In July of next year will move 400 employees their jobs by the office buildings in the Marienbader place in Homburg bath in the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu shifted his office in Homburg bath to Frankfurt.
As stated on their computers and specialized maintenance giant industries on Wednesday, will be held in July next year, 400 men and women who work in the office buildings in the Marienbader place in Homburg bath in the Astro Park, which is a huge office complex in Lyons street in Frankfurt district of Lower wheel.
A spokeswoman explained by Fujitsu, in the medium term should be housed there yet another 100 jobs of the group, which were distributed to the region.
The rental offer was very attractive, moreover, the Greater offices in the Astro Park, the way the team better.
Also in Homburg bath was Fujitsu only tenants.
The responsible manager Bernd Wagner, "with Frankfurt Lower wheel we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The link to the airport is just for a global companies such as Fujitsu.
The latest move of a key business within the region called yesterday zest for the winners and losers in the disappointment.
The Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU), said it was once again a "global player" won.
It was a "great location commitment".
Fujitsu was the city, the location is an important impetus for the wheel.
The bath Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (Green) regretted the decision by Fujitsu.
The city had been informed of the early management of the intention.
"We have offered the company, of course, our help ," said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts could change, however, none of the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord's property in the Marienbader.
In the end would have economic reasons.
Now it is to prevent a long Leerstand in such a prominent place.
"I hope that the landlord and owner of the building is cooperative."
The Fujitsu previously unused house on City Hall Square and the neighbouring small "vertical" were with the other buildings in the Marienbader place ten years ago, one of the most controversial building project of the Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developers arose between City Hall station and a new city, the starting point, both because of the massive development of previously partly as a car park land use and the level of the buildings for criticism.
In 2001, the investment advisory and credit rating companies Feri, the software maker for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and then with the computer maker Fujitsu Siemens houses.
The Fujitsu the buildings was acquired in 2006 by the German real estate opportunities group along with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later, the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu based in Tokyo Konuzern describes itself as the world's third largest IT providers.
He represents companies such as computers and servers and is also making the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhine, Main area is one of the largest in Germany, many more employees, Fujitsu in Munich.
From the bath Homburg subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt in a wheel, the other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services, a company called TDS.
It has been hired in the office buildings Astro Park 7000 square metres.
In the twenty years old complex - the name plays on his sternförmigen footprint - has, among other things, the National Association of electrical engineering and electronics industry is located.
Amazon blocking server - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly paranoid.
The Internet service providers Amazon has banished the Enthüllungs platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables diplomats.
Assange WikiLeaks founder, allegedly in England.
The Enthüllungs platform Wikileaks is in the United States is increasingly under fire.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now seeking an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, whereas other countries and companies to boycott of Wikileaks.
And the Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the list of wanted by Interpol, to stay after a newspaper report in Britain.
"By Wikileaks Amazon's server."
"Free speech in the land of the Free", the Enthüllungs activists by short messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Just had banned the Internet companies Amazon the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had with the publication of the secret diplomatic dispatches on the Amazon Web service (AWS) used to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks to step further: "Prima - our dollars are being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon have such a problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop to sell books ."
Amazon have halted the use of its servers by Wikileaks, having had a staff of Senator Joe Lieberman, told the CNN television, citing the office Liebermans.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security Amazon had threatened a boycott, told the British newspaper.
"I would have liked that Amazon is taking this action sooner, given the previous publications klassifizierter information by Wikileaks ," said the senator.
Lieberman, meanwhile, to deny the platform in other countries the use of servers.
"WikiLeaks' illegal, hideous and thuggery puts at risk our national security and around the world ," hießt it lives in a communication of the French party is that of independent elected senator.
"No responsible companies, whether American or foreign-sounding - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to disseminate stolen material."
Assange, the WikiLeaks founder is sought on charges of rape by the authorities in Sweden, is on the list of wanted by Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent, "the 39-year-old Australians in Britain, the exact location of Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has described the investigation in Sweden as intrigue of his opponents.
Kristinn Hrafnsson Wikileaks spokesman said in London, there had been threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange rightly fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to keep hidden.
Hrafnsson responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, that should be tried and executed the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations for treason.
In Canada, said an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper - ironically - on television, "Assange should be killed" and "Obama make use of a drone ."
Between the White House and Assange arose while a tennis match.
The spokesman for the U.S. President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if it is for the recent espionage urges diplomats.
"I am not quite sure why we are concerned about the opinion of a guy with a Web site ," Gibbs.
"our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than a website. "
The American government is the protection of their data banks fully to the test.
As a special envoy to the deputy director of the Centre for anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers, appointed, told the White House.
Travers was responsible for "the necessary structural reforms ', which are after the disclosure of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House wants to check the ways in which protects exchanging information and the entire government.
The American government also announced that, for the safety of dissidents and to most active, should they get through the Wikileaks publication in danger.
"We have done everything to come in contact with them ," said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them, if necessary."
The ice in the University of
"Gelato at the University of Bologna" be prepared Eiskonditoren better times of the year.
The three-day course for the future Gelatieri has the largest gains and visitors from all over the world.
Why is there, in fact, the whole ice?
Gela is being damaged by the animals and the Gelataio.
The Gela is being damaged animals, in German, the old-fashioned Eiskonditor, the cream of all the rules of Italian Eismacherkunst.
The Gelataio is catching up with the Spachtel ice cream from the refrigerated shelf, cut them in the Waffel and sold them.
In order to know this, we must be in Anzola dell Emilia drive in the province of Bologna.
But who would like to know more about ice, which is not in the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani over.
The ice University has established the manufacturers of Eismaschinen in 2003 so that the ice cream from his machines everywhere the Italian high ideals.
The three-day course for the future Gelatieri has the largest gains and visitors from around the world.
But there is also Spezialkurse travel spread over several days around the chocolate ice cream and internships in the domestic Eisdiele.
Some dreams in mid-life crisis by a new career, others venture just take the treacherous ice of vague aspirations.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from every continent - from Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food Movement and wants to offer in the country's industrial Cream Ice in future an European quality product.
Anke from Berlin is corporate adviser and wants to eintüten after years in a nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptians dream to open in Cairo an Eisdiele.
A man from Malta and from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian Chamber Mrs Yulia, because their children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gela is being damaged animals Luciano Ferrari said the participants the ideal attributes of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency.
Luciano has not forgotten his training but also the icing on the cake of national and even Latin Überbaus: "Italy Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism."
The first step towards the production seems quite simply.
Luciano repeals the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a big Mixgerät, heated with an electronic programme to 85 degrees and then cools immediately to four degrees.
Then he pulls the plug on a machine, and in a white base pasteurised cream, basis for all Milcheissorten.
The lecturer will immediately bombarded with questions: can produce only ice cream with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can the experimental a free rein?
Luciano warns, from the Zeitgeist astray.
How many ice cream "only from natural ingredients," has used may nevertheless stabilisers - usually a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne.
Of course, can produce ice without stabilizer, it must only be sold within a day, otherwise sackt it, and the customer bites on Eiskörnchen louder.
Some variation on the basic mass are permitted.
It will be more exciting with flavourings.
For the taste of ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit or the sweets section of the supermarket.
There are also some powder and Pasten.
"The suppliers will try to foist onto you dozens of aromatised additions."
"But you should experiment just."
Either the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or the ice cream from the white of the mass, with eggs, cream and yellow with cocoa powder on the basis for all sorts of temptations offered chocolate.
Now, the course participants in the Eismaschinen.
Luciano leaves they each have four different types of vanilla, chocolate, Mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment will be subject to the Fruchteissorten.
More flavouring substances, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream tastes not necessarily nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwis ice, the working group, which used more fruit, less water and less stabiliser.
A balanced mix highlight the taste of a Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Eisherstellung is a computing task: will use peach puree with high sugar, must be reduced the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
For lemon ice is an extra dose of sugar.
Luciano draws a device, with a consequent impact on the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winemakers to measure the Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, facilitate the Rechnerei tables.
Ice to make no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
Not only the device for the automatic establishment of the mass.
There is also a device in which the final ice mixture and at the same time cremig is cooled to minus temperatures.
Of all the automation despite not remain small margins.
The Brazilian Gustavo acquitted himself and his colleagues rate from top to bottom with fruit puree, as he puts the oversized hand blenders out of control.
"In every direction ," says Luciano Maestro, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Controllers in the twilight zone
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa was undermined by the experimental Crops with industry.
That said, the group of experts test biotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well ," said test biotech boss Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa group of experts on genetically modified crops, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert, for years the lobbyists'Association Ilsi under contract.
The will of corporations such as Monsanto, Bayer or Nestle.
Kuiper contributed significantly to the Efsa testing requirements for Crops and, in a clear conflict of interest, Then.
The Efsa rules are absatzweise word for word with the Ilsi position papers and had the hallmarks of the industry, which is to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It was the second time that indication test biotech a conflict of interest.
As a senior manager Efsa recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss company Syngenta farm - and have changed the sides.
The German broadcasting resources (MDR) had recently unveiled personal connections between of EU authority and industry lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Office, as EU parliamentarians sympathetic.
The Efsa can see, however, no conflict of interest.
We refer to all serious data, also on the industry, as long as they are of a high technical quality, says in a statement.
The experts who work for Efsa, charged that they have no contact with the industry.
They would have to disclose this but open.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This describes himself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and policy - among other things, the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby.
In the case of criticising independent experts such as Then that allow genetically modified crops currently without any attempt to feed animals and shall not tested the response of Crops environmental influences.
"We want to know, for example, genetically modified maize on the land ," says Then.
Current practice is merely an isolated proteins to test but not the whole Genpflanze, what am no reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how do you find them ?" asks Then point an accusing finger.
It also provides for Hilbeck Angelika.
The research scientist since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is currently in the Technical School Zurich.
The industry is trying in this field as in the United States in Europe more and more to influence critical scientists or discredit.
There was therefore hardly researchers who are intertwined with corporations.
For business critical studies were published in the rule.
"The industry controls the security research ," said Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has also worried what, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night he was masked Stuttgart station, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It snowed heavily.
It is the same old story: In September, the angerückt dredging and had begun to break off a slice of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands marched against S21, the low humane billions of the station.
When it came to the freeze, a large part of the wing in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000.
Crailsheimer shellfish lime, a soft rough stone blocks, between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell sculptor is in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured a few of the slice.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He schwärmt: "A cheaper and poor, simple and erdenhaft. "
As he aufsägte, smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he will do with the scraps, he does not know.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The trail of Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen, a former ammunition depot in the French army, which has built its Rongen Manuel stone empire.
The 44 Jährige, with old stones.
He has bought all those who fell in the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a disgrace, they would be Schotter gemahlen or disappear in the landfill ," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a prison van.
I have insulted and threatened him, he said, as in September in the newspapers that he bought the remnants of the northern wing of the demolition.
But he has talked with the S- 21 opponents, for days.
And he explained to them that he could now be nothing for the demolition.
And if it is, then it is the most sensible, if used the stones.
Some 200 S- 21 opponents took an average of 80 kg, with serious Quader unit price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, but also in the hope, to be able to return him to a reconstruction.
500 tonnes had bought Rongen, 25 large lorry loads.
About half is still in the forest, the rest is sold.
Gartenbesitzer, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
They come from everywhere, and would have weggeschleppt, which could take boot and supporters.
The Stuttgart stumbling stones have long been in "Mäuerle" or limits of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is nothing special ," says Rongen.
"Would not be the political component."
He is in his SUV, a tour through his 20.
He has studied law and, later, biology, he has an interest in computers and has stone traders.
Stone and lovers.
40000 tonnes of stones store it.
From across Germany karrt his treasures.
He says that he is the largest Altsteinhändler of the Republic.
He put the brakes on.
In the snow, skilful behauene sand stones.
"They were the Marienbrücke Dresden ," he said.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he schwärmt.
"My favourite stone."
It is the way high through the forest.
It shows a pile of sand: red stone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And even further.
"Beautiful Travertin."
Once belonged to the Quader to the gallery of the Neckarstadions Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the police headquarters in Stuttgart, rötlicher granite from the cathedral, St. Blasien Tuff Heilbronner from the hospital.
The work, the effort, sweat.
If Rongen thinks that being the stones used to manually and moved with simple bottles and ox carts, he will be reverential.
"It would be a scandal if schreddern something."
He has not become rich, not very rich.
But 14 people employed in the stone traders today, also have high up in the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, established a Glasbläser and horticulturalists.
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory ," says the remnants scrap-yard.
Soon after, he must Cologne.
There, too, to save it.
Talentekampf high potential in order to
There is a strong run at the Buffet.
16 students thronging to salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweet.
The Technical University of brown and be the automakers Volkswagen invited the engineering and design students at a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition to fachsimpeln them together with VW Entwicklern on the car of the future - and get to know in Volkswagen.
In the competition for the brightest, many companies are now in the Nahkampf and VW, in cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates early in the hearing rooms, before they come to the labour market and be hoodwinked by others.
And because the universities no data on the performance of their students, trying to spot the exceptional talent in practice projects and to commit itself.
On the second day of the workshop of the TU brown be advertises the car company in the talent.
A young lady distributed from the personnel department pens, and Mappen jelly-babies with VW logo.
They told the promising young talents of training programs and student jobs and show them ways in the company.
Nico Selle from the TU brown be cared for the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come in contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, interesting candidates closer to look at and consider, who as a staff member in question."
Such cooperation, Selle, are not unusual.
What is new is that gebuhlt so aggressively to the students.
"Otherwise, the emphasis was more on the technical project ," says Selle.
The battle for the fresh graduates will become even harder.
In many industries can rely on the companies, their employees more from a large crowd of applicants.
But they have to advertise and balzen particularly for highly skilled workers.
Above all, graduates from engineering disciplines are in a strong negotiating position.
According to the Association of German engineers VDI remained in October 40.000 engineering vacancies unfilled.
And the so-called engineer gap will be VDI according to forecasts.
For the accounting and consulting firm KPMG is novel Dykta on the talent hunt.
He organised elaborate Recruiting events such as KPMG Race, a kind of modern with trails, in which the participants using GPS coordinates their way.
Eight promising students want to send the company so next year across the United States.
Incidentally, the participants KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Who can, with two rounds of selection in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies in the United States.
The cut and thrust of the high potential in universities, the guns, according to Dykta.
"We want to set ourselves apart with the Race from the crowd."
"Only a simple Segeltörn was too little."
For talent hunters Dykta seems to be working the bill.
"We have to date with all participants in a similar action last year."
"Some are nearing completion and want to apply soon with us ," he says.
In addition to the direct Buhlen on campus, especially small and medium-sized businesses also classic in professional fairs on the Pirsch.
"We are trying to achieve graduates to specialist fairs."
"To the solar ," reported Sitha Stübe staff, head of the solar technology manufacturers Solar World.
The Bonn company employs about 1500 staff in Germany.
Stübe knows about the young.
At the moment are advertised on the company website 35 posts.
"It is very difficult to fill vakante positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money ," she says.
Another way is the contact on the hit professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the Free University in mountain.
"The professors give indications that we work placements or write his thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns are not required in the solar specialists.
It is trying to promote the company with other advantages for themselves: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and ease of communication.
"We cannot provide a big corporation often ," says head Stübe staff.
Money is not seeking work longer the main role.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other key factors.
Solarworld documented in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute's 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute compiles an annual league table of German employers.
It asked the staff as they are satisfied with their work and their Jobumfeld and look at the framework conditions for the workers.
Personalleiterin Stübe hopes the placement also points in the Jobsuchenden.
"I think that, especially after external assessments about a potential employers ," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler by the Germans Employer branding academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy with a good reputation as an employer.
He advises his clients to more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, particularly internal measures.
"The best way to make themselves as attractive employer, on their own staff ," he says.
In the industry jargon that is internal Employer branding, Arbeitgebermarkenbildung within its own staff.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you do unto his people well and they identify themselves with the company, then selling them from alone with friends and acquaintances for their employers.
"This is like a game with gang ," says Kriegler.
Obama would stop new drilling for oil
Off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico will be in the coming years, no new drilling.
Such a ban issued by the government in Washington - and to cancel its previous plans.
Also off the Atlantic coast remain banned new drilling for the time being.
The Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar announced on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which will be valid for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon "drilling platform" in April.
Before the accident, the eleven workers dead and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, had indicated that President Barack Obama is under pressure from the opposition and the industry's willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Those who want to reduce the dependence of the United States of oil supplies from abroad.
Who is responsible for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf, is not resolved until today.
At the heart of the criticism of the British energy company BP, which is faced with billions.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama to present during the course of the Dezembers their results.
In October, had waived Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, after the explosion of drilling ban.
In the end had several oil companies immediately applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter safety rules to exclude Obama and Salazar, a new disaster.
Currently, the competent supervisory authority, which was after numerous corruption charges into disrepute, radically reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced lucrative tax breaks for the oil and Gaskonzerne.
The industry warns now publicly that would be the amount in the Gulf by stricter regulation significantly lower than in the past.
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry ," is the result of a recent industry survey by the consultancy firm BDO - before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also lamented the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what will change with the regulation."
Investment in new projects would be delayed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned off
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it smells like the petrol station: billions of litres of crude oil spills have destroyed the natural in Nigeria's Ogoniland.
The people of theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it well.
"Struggling not to ," reassured the Ökoaktivist journalists:" Just get enough slime today before the lens. "
The 37-year-old Nigerian has attempted an abzulichten until the breast in the water watenden boys surround him with the Schlieren: in the regenbogenfarbenen water on the scene almost nicely.
That are below the surface brown swathes of crude oil, is not to see.
In the past they have gathered here eimerweise shrimp, Esther told Badom on the shores of the Bodo Jetty river.
Meanwhile, the lazy river waters completely dead.
Five years ago, poured from a geborstenen pipeline vast quantities of crude oil in the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby small, Bodo must row six hours to get in fischhaltige waters: in the heart of the Niger Delta, Ogoniland is seen as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world.
On the journey through the river basins criss-crossed mangrove swamps, the full extent of the devastation evident.
Rather than shed some water frantically the motor boat brown gruel, who has his hands in the water, ölige finger.
The roots of the mangrove Bäumchen stand out as black Lakritzstangen, sad, some are true to their Wedel palm trees.
Vogelschwärme, as usual in wetlands, in vain: as soon as the silent foreign Border, is spreading in the petrol station smelling like a former paradise straws calm.
"What happens here is ecological warfare ," says Celestine Akpobari gloomy:" We are living in constant danger to health. "
The comparison is appropriate.
The area where the Ogoni is a battlefield for decades disputed that there were more than 60 years ago, the first Explorateure from Europe, organised here in the 80 s with the later executed writer Ken Saro Wiwa, the first opposition here had to stop the Shell group 1993 production, because it was too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is not allowed to return to Ogoniland. While pumping from the delta region of triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometres of pipelines every day more than two million barrels of black gold, broke the oilfields in Ogoniland, the corporation is too unstable the situation.
Every few hundred metres stählerne Gestelle stand out as bizarre sculptures from the water, "Christian Bäumchen" the heads of the boreholes far too zärtlich.
They are up to 50 years old, the canisters had most to the core.
Always stop such drilling head, says Akpobari, then rinne a constant flow of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres leaked after experts estimate that in 50 years into the ecosystem of the Yangtze, year after year, the amount of oil, as in the case of the "super tanker Exxon Valdez," 21 years ago into the sea in Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is to blame for the continuing ecosphere MCA, it is argued.
While the Shell, sabotage and organised Öldiebstahl for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists berstende drilling heads and lecke pipelines as the main polluters.
The Shell in Nigeria significantly lower safety standards than anything else in the world, accused the U.S. scientist Richard Steiner's group 2008: alone is the rate of defects in the pipes "many times higher than elsewhere ."
In one place, from a distance, looks like an abandoned garage ölverschmierte open-air, from the mangrove characters: you are ölverschmiert splitternackt and up to the neck.
Under one of the many kegs, which combined with tubes, scattered there are sometimes arbitrarily on the site, flackert a fire: an illegal small refinery.
In the heated barrel of crude oil on the fire several hours, Michael, the head of the group.
First introduced petrol through the pipes in the reception, spits a little later, at the end of the line, finally, diesel and kerosene.
So, Michael and four people on a daily basis up to four barrels à 300 litre diesel: "That brings us a 34.000 Naira "- around $22.
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state of sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has a single refinery.
With the 40 euro cents per litre of diesel ridiculously low price can undercut the illegal Kocher still: their raw material they get for free.
He comes from "Bunkerern", the tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta on a daily basis, at least 16 million litres of crude oil.

Thousands of dead buddy grieve for
More than 10.000 people have thought in New Zealand's buried miners who have been declared after several explosions in a mine for dead.
Still have not recovered the bodies, because the security situation in the subsurface, precarious.
Less than two weeks it was in the Pike River mine near the town of Grey Mouth to a violent explosion.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 years were buried underground.
A probe had been hinabgelassen accident in the subsurface, had discovered but no trace of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions have attended a meeting for security reasons, no rescue forces.
After the second violent blasts were the authorities and experts that there was no chance of survival for mates.
The bodies were found not so far.
Now, family and friends with a commemoration of the dead.
Ten thousand people had gathered in radioactive sunshine in Grey Mouth of the South Island of New Zealand.
Two minutes remained silent.
In honour of the buried miners were set up 29 tables, lamps and helmets, to see were the names of the buddy.

To hell, warrior!
Splatter fits the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn testing with his fighters epic "Valhalla over there Rising" old genre borders.
In the audience may have thought of the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn Valhalla over there, "Rising" has changed?
A captured Vikings warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed himself from his tormentors and with almost superhuman forces multitudes of his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because it uses our hero like rough methods of killing and seized his enemies before the Gedärme from the vibrant, if he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, says Einauge, as it is called, the film is not a word, and the other characters sought to succumb to a maximum of one or two sentences or a few agonizing death cries.
Otherwise silent and feasted on the hill gruselig beautiful landscape of Scotland, the Vikings world of about a thousand years ago the scene.
Ideal for adult Cineasten with interest for Existenzialismus and very serene camera.
Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn applies since his wild and gestylten drug dealers trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically, his works with a little humor the mainstream or a little less brutality, Arthouse accessible.
Most of the art cinema friends are likely to be deterred from around the spritzenden brain mass and the Gedärmen.
The Action fans dying at the latest, boredom, if Einauge from freely suspensive reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship is on his way to Jerusalem and trapped forever in a downturn and fog, before the team apparently in America and silent.
No wonder, then, that "Rising Valhalla over there" has been found in Germany no cinema distribution and appeared only on DVD.
This is particularly because of the magnificent images of a hangover, but also because it is hiding behind the façade of a blood-stained unpretentious and sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention.
In this film is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is all filmgewordener atmosphere, a fever dream.
And there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn give him barely a moment of relaxation and puts him with his icy images and the dark trance world Sound Track very slowly throat, but above all with the unspeakable hatred of him is from the heart of the characters.
Only a small blonder boy, the Einauge faithful to one side, something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
The vast majority of the einäugige hero, whose motives, but the will of enemies and allies temporarily at some point the warriors from hell, perhaps to the ambassadors of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the Verdorbenen anyway.
"Valhalla over there Rising" is a puzzling, the film can hate and admire, Ärgern, Aufregen and laughable.

Erdarbeiten puzzling
The Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country is, however, to comment on - nor does it controls.
At midnight on 5 and 6 September 2007 are at least four Israeli F- 15 I fighter planes, a mystery, würfelförmiges building in Syria.
It is on the banks of the Euphrates; the next major city, 30 kilometres, is Dair as Saur.
Their name comes up in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, built with Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley, the lack of electricity.
According to a briefing of the U.S. foreign intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008 would have been appropriate, also under the name of the nearby town of el Kibar so common reactor to produce plutonium - to build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes, by contrast, the technology from the fifties.
The CIA has produced a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By Computeranimation they played a, where they are supposed to be what components of the reactor, before the destruction of the Yongbyon fell a copy of the North Korean nuclear model from the centre.
In addition, it presented photos, the building from the show or even the atrium.
The reactor has been just before the operation, it said, but has not yet been drawn up with fuel prongs.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, the mystery over time were more likely to grow.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack fairly sure that Syria built in el Kibar a reactor, but hardly points to the fact that the country "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe are still cautious and prefer to speak of a "alleged reactor ," even if the CIA presentation of" plausible ".
You do not have hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he was sure to have a nuclear reactor, said a senior U.N. diplomat in the summer only shrug, the IAEA "enough material to ask questions ."
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building", the Syrians are rushing to one side and planierten the terrain.
Nevertheless, took place in June 2008 an IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el Kibar traces of uranium that had been made by people.
In addition, the IAEA on a Member State provider of commercial satellite images from the period immediately after the attack, the more meaningful than the one presented by the CIA.
However, to get these recordings on the market, because of the unknown client - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusively.
The IAEA could not verify their authenticity.
Syria has always, never a secret nuclear program or built a nuclear reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Since then, refuses to Damascus to discuss it - as well as on the satellite images.
It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed-out building.
But Israel says sticking.
"We will never comment on this ," said recently at the time of the attack, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position.
So limps toward the investigation of the case since June 2008 fruitless and "is becoming increasingly to a serious credibility problem for the authority ,", a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - after all, is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, which the IAEA.
As the key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently three other facilities, the "in" functional link to relate to the alleged reactor - and unlike this.
The inspectors have so far not open, what plants are, or what role they have or what they considered suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and satellite images of a building complex in Masyaf, which is probably one of the suspected of objects.
It may be in or adjacent to a military base - with this explanatory statement denied Syria, the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that will be sent on ahead so the IAEA from the United States, in order auszuspähen military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives were turned off by the U.S. secret services to the facilities.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that was transported between the three locations and the Quader material on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna, could at least one of the plants' in connection with the fuel production ".
"But there was no evidence of sensitive activities" uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor operated with enriched uranium, which is not.
But where the uranium could have come from and where it should be separated from it later the plutonium for the bomb, on these key issues, there are at most plausible assumptions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could run the valuable traces, stored in three places.
As if the hundreds of lorry loads from the earth, no one wants to have information about where the rubble.
The only a few kilometres from el Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al Tibni, has studied the Syria 1998 on their suitability as a storage facility for radioactive waste, the IAEA as unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images for the prestigious journal Jane's Intelligence Review 'of the reactor.
Borrowed from the orbiting show that Syria to the three suspected places Erdarbeiten and large container, after the IAEA access.
This may be a coincidence, but little to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, they say in diplomatic circles, have used the IAEA several months to develop a plan for inspections, which should allow Syria to maintain military secrets - shows the amount of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal.
Had reassured Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, yes, that is why it is not a high sense of urgency, such as U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months' special inspections, one of the harshest means that the Vienna nuclear authority to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, these inspections should suggest, has been "an option, for which I am in the future ', but still he hesitates.
It is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs for a majority of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat: "What if they end up with nothing?"
Ladies in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie has started in the summer with the work on her debut, is still unknown but there is anger.
The script has written it himself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that is enough.
Meanwhile, the rumour that the woman, a Muslim, verliebe during the war in Yugoslavia their Serb rapists.
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, and some have been transferred in Sarajevo, the days in the short term to Hungary.
It is now being cut off from the film in Hungary and in the post production, but it will still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic by the organisation of female victims of war, wrote about the U.N. Refugee Relief UNHCR of Jolie and demanded a meeting with the Rin spectacles, has reported a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is Ambassador to the U.N. Refugee Relief and Works Agency.
Diplomatically, it is not - it has offered the women from weeks before a meeting in Hungary, which rejected the but.
The meeting should be held in Bosnia, Hasecic.
Liebesgeschichten in rape camps have not, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims of their enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended that the U.N. Refugee Relief according to dismiss Jolie as ambassador, told the Guardian.
But what exactly has written for Jolie scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was to read the script, has issued after some ups and downs a hub of Sarajevo - it is not clear why not then Jolie.
The young car Rin asserts itself, they had no political intentions with its film, have worked with a lot of trouble in the Yugoslav conflict, the terrible consequences of war and give all parties a voice.
The content, however, it remains vague.
The idea of a second Synopsis to film in the network, which then sounds quite differently: The lovers knew it before war broke out and meet again, as they are, a Bosnian Muslim, is being dragged into a Serb Camp, where he worked as a guard.
What is significantly different than the sounds of "rape victims in verknallt torturer ."
The film begins Jolie already before the war - that much is certain.
The pressure on them, Jolie, "unfair and based on misinformation ."
Now she can only the hackers from Hollywood peace: By the script, as so many previously, illegally.
There is nothing like away here
This evening is finally back right around for the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
For the home team dominated his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans johlen with joy in krachend loud music, they conjure with their feet.

And yet tries to amuse the 26 Jährige, distracting from the nagging question of what the future holds.
His plan is not fun game in Las Vegas, he will hold talks in January for applications in New Zealand.
"I have an uneasy," he says.
"It is so far away from home and I have no work."
After all, his girlfriend in Auckland waiting for him, "she ruck, their desire zuck job as event manager, perhaps a good sign ," says the young man is smiling and.

The boys: How the Tanners looks on the island in many families.
100.000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, experts say, the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015, they even with 200.000 immigrants.
For a small country with 4.5 million inhabitants, a heavy loss.
The predictions come true, a wave of emigration, comparable to those suffered by Ireland in the eighties.
After a decade of recovery, which has brought great prosperity for the Irish, is now once again sadness.
The economic crisis, especially the young, well-educated Irish, for which it was only uphill.
Jobverlust and social decline appeared in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money, there were in abundance.
But now, three out of ten women and men under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times abound reader letters young emigrants who complain: "Everything is in Ireland the edge."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who goes away, and our country will lose a whole generation."
"The last, then please the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish students union, raise a bleak future, because the government only window dressing, and offer young people no longer prospects.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy on how to create new jobs ," says the 20 Jährige.
They watched as their fellow students to be bound by an unpaid internship to the next.
Their main concern, she says, to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
The men are trying to fill Stephen McLarnon the issue in a positive way.

The message is clear: In the work is not a Galeerendienst abroad, but also brings freedom and fun.
As we feel them, build something else, Mr O Donovan for half a year.
Because there was for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they just a fashion house.
In January it goes after Hanover or Berlin, on to the next project.
His home is O Donovan now only rarely, since he does extra classes, in order to be able to abbezahlen credit for his house at home.
"The situation is a little crazy ," he says, as he comes after a long time for the first time on the threshold of his house.
"I deserve money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am almost never again."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through ausgekühlte spaces.
The small house is in a residential area with fine leafy front gardens, in the Einfahrten park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380.000 euros - credit-financed 100 percent.
"It was crazy times, it was easy money without many questions ," he says.
He fears that it could go wrong with the credit?
O Donovan thought for a while, pour hot tea and says: "I have no children, I have to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch. "
The engineer may not laments that he often hears at present.
"No one should go hungry - our situation is not nearly as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island ," he says.
"A while working abroad, this is not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps we feel it only as Irish."
He laughs and tells of his father, who in the last major economic crisis to England.
"After seven years, he was back and life in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
The future and see how it goes with the life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London, he has already behind them and why should it not in New Zealand are also good for him and his girlfriend?
One thing is, however, the worries him in these days of: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could turn into a human welfare Party.
"Not too many emotions ," he says, and drink a big a bite of his beer.
"Goodbye, but it sounds scary."
"We call it a Weggehparty, very loosely, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The demokatrische routine,
The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than the unemployment.
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results, the Latinobarómetro survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
This survey will be carried out regularly since 1995 and shows that the exchange of views in this region.
Two facts fall in this year's poll in September and October, particularly in the eye.
First, the good mood in Latin America
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries of the South American Pacific coast has increased the democratic movement is strong. (Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy is growing every year since 2002 by about 6%, the number of democracy advocates from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
In Mexico, where the economy since the collapse last year begins, there is such a trend.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are staunch Democrats, reducing the regional average. Diagram (2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said that they would be with the country's democratic practice. There are as many as last year, however, 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3).
About 34% of the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both of these values is identical to that of last year, but a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago undermined Latin America's economic crisis, the efforts for more democracy.
It lasted this during the world economic crisis, it may be that the countries of Latin America only a brief recession, and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor have been absorbed by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America this week rose by 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly, and has fallen this year at 32%.)
But from country to country, there are strong differences mood graph (. 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession mount and have increased violent crime, this is less the case.
Only the second time since the beginning of the survey respondents see many in Latin America in the crime in their country a greater problem than the unemployment graph. (5).
Some 31% say that they were either themselves or a family member in the past year, victims of a crime. But, compared to 38% last year, the values and the lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the strong support of the private sector and the market economy: 71% of respondents überregional said that the private sector for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (6). Graph.
Approximately 58%, that only the market economy in their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, have retained 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view (and 80% are in favour of a private sector), although their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies.
Brazil, according to the 19% of respondents (18% last year), the biggest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see in the United States, the most influential country, taken over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua and Venezuela.
Election defeat
No one had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts, the fears of the election workers who rushed to help the war-torn country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, election notes in the Rinnstein polling stations, destroyed and intimidation were only part of the problem.
Polling stations opened late with watching.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become by the earthquake in January, homeless roamed around in search of a choice.
Finally, some blamed on.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged leader, on the basis of an alleged fraud in the election results.
Across the country, there have been some violent protests.
Nevertheless, Mulet Edmond, the head of the U.N. mission in Haiti, the election as "quite well in many respects".
According to a cautious statement of observers from the Organization of American States and the Community Caribbean "these irregularities, so serious they may be, not necessarily the process invalid ."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, the supposedly the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Célestin Jew, is obliged, the preliminary results announced on 7 December.
The expected run-off is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Walmart Elly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial annulment proceedings.
If Célestin Jew, with voters have little or no support from the Wahlberhörde declared the winner of the run-off, this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million victims of the earthquake are still living in tents, feared a low turnout.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented by lack of organisation of the vote.
Just before the start of the election were about 250.000 cards, which are needed for election, or not.
There is a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate government, recognised as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle of
In the weeks after the sudden death of your man told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy that pushed their popularity rate by 20 points to more than 50%. This is the highest value since its election in 2007.
Whether her, but next year to a re-election depends on whether the visibly mourning Cristina Fernández be more willing than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who drew even after the election of his wife's economic policy, often budgets, the tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the president, the couple spend extra revenue as they see fit.
On paper, the Fernández government last year, the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27, led to further divisions.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten rally behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which a parliamentarian another in the face, and others accused the government of the bribery) Congress failed to pass the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss it ," the President.
The 2010 budget is now for the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit.
The economy is hot: they probably will grow this year by up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands from the unions - the value of nearly 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was beset by economic crises, growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, the private sector out for bullying as his säuberte and the National Institute for Statistics and census INDEC, the schönte then the official inflation statistics.
Fernández can take a mäßigeren?
It has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks.
And according to official statements to be wage increases next year to 18%.
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
But the inflation undermined the spurt of growth through a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps join Cristina Fernández for this reason, Argentina economic terms to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government has an agreement with shareholders, who had rejected the previous rescheduling of the country in 2001.
Now seems to push Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, rejected.
But last month, the Economics Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical assistance" will do. It appears that this would be the first step towards the cleansing of the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández after the end of its term of office without the support of her husband politically active.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough by the Kirchnerismus.
If the Argentines in March from their summer holidays, the wave of sympathy, it has been shown to be fizzled.
If they want to win another election, they must decide whether to lift many political decisions taken by her husband's quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are coming slowly closer link to the mainland.
What Taiwan from his big brother on the other side of the Straits?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of all eligible voters, so that in the five city districts to elect mayors and city councils. This will be seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying jeou.
The revolutionary business relations, einschl. A partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol for relations with the mainland. Its policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949.
Ma has passed the test, but only barely.
Although his party, the Kuomintang (KMT), three of the five mayors, they received a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT won 45%.
In a presidential election would have meant for Ma problems.
Since his election two years ago was the vote of his party by about 8%.
For the first time the DPP even with the KMT in town councils.
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as truck convoys with rioters, flags schwenkende mass parades and only scantily clad dancers.
There were even compulsory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, on the eve of the election in a speech to a KMT candidate,
As a man from the crowd in the face. LIEN was wounded and killed an umstehender viewers.
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidates.
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai Ing whom, the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, which has caused the KMT more votes.
China may have been the biggest winners of the campaign.
Remarkably, there was little point in relations with the mainland.
Instead, the candidates have plans to social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time avoided the DPP to stir up feelings against Chinese.
They responded to the new knowledge that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese its China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan with economic incentives in the community.
China sent a negotiator in Taipei, a summit to investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly it wants a political integration. But first things first.
It is therefore prefer until after the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has reinvented itself now.
Two years ago it was weakened sharply: the former party leader Chen Shui bian sat in jail for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he began for the absolute independence.
But under Tais reign, a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai took as a presidential candidate of the DPP support, such as Su Tseng chang under Chen.
Their party is doing everything in order to show that they, too, is in a position to build close ties with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a blacksmiths ideas as a contact point between the DPP and China, however, broad discussions.
Tsai stated publicly that their party a "credible alternative" to Ma's • rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell, he said, the candidate of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He called for the pragmatists Su even to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without the interference of Chen's DPP difficult to choose their potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Ma's values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidate wanted to campaign without him.
The main reason for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman to reorganize his cabinet, and local institutions.
The strong performance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan a rapprochement only restricted.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there are no return".

Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula took place after five hours of often heated public hearing the unanimous approval of the local planning committee.
Critics threw the project, both to promote terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center local rules and will be an aesthetic catch-the-eye.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others ," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As Americans makes me proud."
"It shows that there is justice."
"There are only a few opponents ," he added.
"They are very loud."
"In this valley live wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the building of the centre lasted until nearly midnight, and the votes were distributed on both sides, according to the Press Enterprise fairly evenly.
The debate on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no longer America ," said a commentary.
"It is a different planet of the apes, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centres have also held in other parts of the country to protest, for example, in the vicinity of Ground Zero, the site of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on 11 September 2001.

Opponents can appeal to the city council still objected to the project.
Arsenic resistant microbe could new forms of life on Earth or allow
The discovery of an alien species of bacteria, which can live of arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is in their view, a sign that a life without the previously deemed as vital elements.
"This organism has two options."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"This makes it to something very unusual, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' way of life ," said C.W. Paul Davies of Arizona State University Co and author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, have been viewed as vital six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphate and sulphur.
But the scientists figured out how the bacterium in the Californian mono Lake even further when it replaced phosphorus, arsenic.
"One wonders what else is possible ," said the author of the report Co D. Ariel Anbar from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life, since scientists must recognize and his life forms, Anbar.
The study deals with microbes, which have been found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which gave no details of the discovery known, led to widespread speculation on the Internet that could act on the report by the discovery außerirdischen life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that can put in other planetary systems, with the help of other elements biochemical processes and that the 'standard' elements that are absolutely essential in our opinion, are not necessarily clear ," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the University of a Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research teams.
"This work is something new, because it shows that can be replaced in fundamental biochemical processes and structures an element by another ," said Cockell added.
This discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe Simon from Astro Biological Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.
The same phosphorus, arsenic and chemically, they indicated that microbes that are both, can replace may be an element of the other.
"The toxicity of the Arsens is based mainly on the fact that it is chemically similar to how phosphorus."
"This is the organisms are difficult to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so large that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus. It is in our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything ," said Anbar.
The researchers, the bacterium GFAJ- 1 rising arsenic concentration. It suited and grew up in.
The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but that they can survive in arsenic, shows that can happen, arsenic was a way of life, of course, either on the ground or on another planet or moon occurs at the arsenic.
According to Jamie S. Foster, President of microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that can be replaced by phosphorus, arsenic. But so far there were no functioning examples.
Arsenic came in the early Erdjahren more frequently, she says, so the science that early life forms have been used.
"There is reason to believe that have developed a life differently than in the early period ," Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National health authorities.

Police operations in China, soft
As a training officer, Tang Bin Shen on an urban, reviewed his subordinates nervous and gave the military authority and muted voice commands.
He wanted to show that its female members of the Cheng Guan - China's robust attendants of urban planning, feared and despised for their indiscriminate raids and their tendency to violence - impress the viewers.
"It is!"
"Looking straight ahead!"
"It shows them ,", he said," how nice girls! "
Four little girls grow out of their teens, with white gloves and identical olivegrünen jackets and trousers stood ramrod straight.
Four pairs of black Pumps were partners in series.
Four proper hats were perfect on the blue with white gestreiften pattern of hair.
"For me, they see on average from ," said Mr Tang disrespectful.
"Models are nicely."
Several governments have attempted to burnish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city all new applicants must have an university degree.
The Guangdong province, instead of the grey green a leuchtend blue uniforms.
Wuhan in central China replaced violence by Dutch gaze: 2009 skittered reportedly 50 officials a properly established snacks and gaze at the operators, until this after half a hour einpackte and left the room.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would like to change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women to strengthen the urban police patrols. They were special because of their appearance, selected their good character and their youth.
They are a crude police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, however, would also Scarlett Johansson, the bad image that the Chinese city of these squads to improve.
By law, the critics.
Unlike the police officers must be the urban laws only impose fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, beat officials in Hubei Province a bystander to death when they filmed with his mobile phone, as they were a protest against a dumping ground.
Last year was stolen from a training manual for Beijing officials and published on the Internet. It describes how can be beaten offenders without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai water melons traders after a fight with five officers brain injuries.
A from violence strotzendes video game that can be downloaded from the Internet, shows in China trained officials in an attack on street traders.
"Chengguan makes the government fear ," lamentierte national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleansing".
Skeptics are the current approach to clearly inadequate.
As was the Distrik in October by the eight female recruits, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News whether the women real tasks would or should serve only as optical distraction.
It is likely that both.
According to display bodies were women between the ages of 18 and 22 with good character and "harmonious facial features" sought.
They should be abnormally high - about 1.5 feet or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the 26th birthday.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 to physically demanding.
"The most important is their image ," there was an unbenannter district officials in the kind of government Web site, $url {Rednet.com}.
"Whether the candidates for the job, first by their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Cheng Guan as flower vases ," he said and added," but in addition, they still have other duties ".
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the city administration of the Javan, may not agree with this description.
But that are not in China sizes in advertisements for both gender and unusual.
The same is true for regular facial features.
Whether it is synonymous with good appearance, is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical changes need not apply.
"We need here, unfortunately, no way or buck leagues ," Mr Zheng.
"Their image would not be good."
Liu Yi, the patroliert at the Baoguang place near a monastery, 22, has Apfelbäckchen and probably formed a mouth.
They empfindetes as sexist, that is placed so much emphasis on their appearance.
"You will find that I see in this sexy uniforms?" Asks them with ironischem.
Her colleague with the Grübchen, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
Its not according to regret the brief cessation, because they would have more ambitious career plans, as scheuchen simply dealers through the alleys, in order to make it to the shops to prevent.
Every morning the Streife deals with approximately twelve hawkers who try to walk or bicycle as many rolls and sell tofu dishes before they are fortgejagt.
"Mr Wang, you ask."
"We told you so many times," said Xu. Frl a dealer, who had fled on foot and had left his on a Fahrradkarre befestigten Nudelküche temporarily.
According to the officials, the monotonous work rather than demanding.
"It is almost the same thing every day ," said Huang Jing, 20, who studied in the distribution system.
"Everything is routine."
One reason is that the female officials the goods of the traders, as their male colleagues, confiscate.
They can threaten offenders only to notify their male superiors.
This is supposed to protect them from public harassment faced by officials in China.
This year randalierte hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour circulated, Cheng Guan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policemen and Chen Guan officers were injured in the incident at night, 14 government vehicles were upset or set on fire.
Xindu spared from such violence incidents so far.
But unrest are not ruling out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where patroulierten female officials this morning, about 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired in contravention of the rules on the pavement, rather than in a garage.
The owners cried a hue and cry.
After 15 minütigem reluctantly gave birth to the officials with cruel in the way of their vehicles and people riding motorcycles and his owners.
Xuedong Li, 40, a coordinator of the male Streife, remained. It was his white shield name in order to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - a supporting role.
But they have been trained not to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we verbally."
"Sometimes, but also physically ," said Mr Li soberly.
"Most of the time to catch the people with the dispute."
Public prosecutor will not Senator Ensign accuse
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice, Senator John Ensign acquitted of the charges, after his affair with a former Wahlhelferin and his attempt to make her husband, a lobbying against him were made, the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday.
That decision ended the most serious legal charges against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, the nationwide headlines and sparked a damper on his career, he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns office, he was known about the verdict after the year-long investigation "delighted".
The ethics committee of the Senate could impose a Disziplarstrafe.
According to the Ensigns lawyers were informed by the Department of Justice that stopped the investigations against Senator Ensign and that in this matter any further charges.
The Justice Ministry refused to comment on the case.
The verdict was for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice a surprise. They believe there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has flouted the ban on lobbying.
Interviews, E e-mails and other documents that have been shown for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times open, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election workers, helped to lucrative contracts to buy his silence about an affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign Ensigns as Treasurer.
Ensign came in contact with some political friends to give Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after the cessation Hamptons lobbying.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensigns election team, it was allowed to take it for a year of lobbying for his former employer, or the full Senate.
According to a statement of ethics experts in the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were friends before the affair, against the ban on the revolving door Lobbykratie.
According to the published evidence "is apparently a consultation and the violation of the revolving door statutes ," Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer who has specialised in the defence of clients who are in the sights of the government.
While the Department of Justice official refused to give the reasons for the decision in the case Ensign known, said Mr. fire and other ethics lawyers, the department seems to be very careful in fuelled political charges after a series of defeats, persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year, the indictment against the former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor to drop.
Prosecutors "are obviously schreckhaft ," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose objective is to fight against corruption in Parliament and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, has brought the various charges against Mr. Ensign in court.
"This means in principle that can expect high-quality government officials now believe that the laws do not apply to them ," she added.
Paul Coggins, main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview on Monday that he had a telephone call from a prosecutor and another the next day, in which he was told that the Ministry will make no complaints against his client.
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday repeated again, "acted in accordance with the law ."
Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments that he had made to the prosecutors to explain in more detail.
"I am not, in the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me. Let me just say this: We believe that made the right decision to have ," he said.
Last month the Federal Election Commission to suspend the investigation because of a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, have breached a payment of $96.000 by Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons against the federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money is something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a big company in Nevada, which has long supported the senator, was one of the firms in which Mr. Hampton was thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists work.
A documented E mail from December 2008, after the company got Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, had a meeting with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was at the Interior Ministry because of a thing "anklopfe".
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers from Nevada, Allegiant Air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport ministers to agree on a meeting on behalf of the airline, after those Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
As of last year for the first time, information about this affair became public, apologize to Mr. Ensign for his constituents and his position in the Senate, where he had been in the order of Republicans in fourth place.
After he was struck many more months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he would like a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer be the target of police investigations, said his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, hope the senator that the Ethics Commission very quickly the example of the Ministry of Justice, and einstelle his investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing its hard work in the service of the people of Nevada ," she said.
Cheshire appeal on Twitter attention
Half a dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom.
In the minutes, verschickten them on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies.
In the end, the defence, there were more than 140.000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and beds gekettete children in a house, the flare-up in flames.
On Thursday, the process closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was indicted, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to find an official end, if the ruling on the death sentence, which the jury, falls.
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court, the grounds for appeal and will employ the courts for years to come.
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it through the intense coverage of the process - through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - to a "circus" atmosphere and a widespread, swift penetration rebel details, so that the jury had been illegally by public outrage.
This objection could lead the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules in the courtroom is necessary.
"As I have seen during this process, I believe that it is a real danger, if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom that every individual's right to a fair trial ," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' main defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue chamber of the Supreme Court, said last week the applications by decision succinctly when he said that the "new media" would be monitored carefully, and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But this was not the last word on this matter.
For decades, the appeals court noted that the coverage of the notorious cases doubts about the fairness of the process.
In his historic 1966 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam, a Sheppard osteopaths from Cleveland, who is said to have killed his wife, lifted and said in its ruling that because of the New Media, "a carnival atmosphere in the courtroom ".
Some believe that a television series and the game film "On the flight" is based on this crime.
Some say lawyers, court appeals, which Mr. Hayes condemnation for half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary to ensure that the channels of communication from the courtroom, which at the time of the case were Dr. Sheppard still inconceivable.
"There is a good reason, about the impact of new media in processes, which will be followed by a wider public, to be worried ," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. His report says that it is imposed arbitrarily.
Professor said Donohue, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of instant communications from the courtroom, could make the process fairer.
The Twitter is just one of many that the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss for years and thus delaying a condemnation.
The defenders claim, for example, that have been regarded Mr. Hayes could already be, as the judges Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential judges by showed during the almost-certain selection grausige scene photos.
Some of the judges said that photographs of the victims, Petit Jennifer Hawke, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and thanking, 11 years, they have met with disgust.
The defenders say, they would also make the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly have exchanged a Juror, who was a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he had exerted undue pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to make the jury over the weekend.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of the extensive coverage of the process is perhaps the greatest interest.
In a judgment that the challenge they have submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for the office of the governor and the American Senate candidate.
They argued that sparked the New media continually the flames of emotion on the case.
"Such a daily crush of media Scandinavia, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom ," the lawyers wrote," has seen it before in New Haven, and perhaps not even across the country. "
Its focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists that the assertion that these are rabble-rousing than direct news reports, which will be reimbursed more slowly, is a technikfeindlicher, the verarme reporting about future processes.
But some lawyers, Appelationsgerichte would often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes need the Adaptation through the courts.
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this claim.
In its objection to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, which was lifted the sentencing of Dr Sheppard due to the reporting and made it clear that the new media, new rules.
"This case ," they wrote," represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can combine courtesy that which divides us?
After a campaign of epithets and negativity broke out this week little civility in Washington.
It is the harbinger of a real Zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before returning to quickly to the parties in the capital?
The meeting Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress brought no breakthrough in the big issues, during the so-called "lame duck" session, the meeting at the end of a government in which decisions are taken no longer had to employ.
After all, what we hear, it was neither to govern a polite discussion between the two sides of a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points.
The public meeting of the deficit commission's president on Wednesday was civilized, despite the political differences that exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect obtained of the ideological divide that separates the members from each other.
This is hardly enough to claim that it has entered a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase, in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, even while trying to weigh up the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters, according to a new parties warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants at a minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to be a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, could expect.
No matter whether taxes, donations, or health benefits, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, voted in the November election, at least for a short time mild.
"No question, the tone has changed ," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which is now for the" Ethics and Public Policy Center "works.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections give partisan passions, the die again.
And that is a good thing. "
In some areas, particularly in those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently.
It is also expected to reach a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that people think that the favored tax cuts for the rich, while they support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased optimism that these issues during the "lame duck" session and at the same time to ratify the new START treaty.
But warns William glass tone of the Brookings Insitution that a successful cooperation in pressing issues of the lame duck session "should not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties, if the new 112th Congress convened in January.
Instead, he says, is a phase of the Nichtübereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done, done, will turn these short-term psychology in confrontation ," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy to gain their cooperation.
"I do not see much of what is happening today until 2012, when Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012 ," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters who were their education.
However, Republican leaders are also concerned about the fact that they play poker too high, they know that they must try to fulfill their pledges to cut government spending and the healthcare reform law.
This party lines are already in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Commission's deficit, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce government spending.
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have assumed that one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so that the deficit issue on the public agenda that cannot be ignored.
But they need within the Commission in 14 of the 18 votes in order to make its plan to official recommendation and they are struggling to come even close to this figure.
The biggest opposition in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, today at least, there is little room for compromise or little sympathy.
Galton says two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will be held next year in the form of party clashes, if Obama Republicans in the state budget, defying the taxes and the health system, followed later by a phase of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is shown that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, the majority of Americans still that the two parties together.
If confrontation in a dead end, as happened in 1995, both parties need to be careful about the public reaction.
Who will always doomed to lose, will change the course and must find a compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are today than in the mid-1990 s, and they seem more ideological divide between Obama and the Republicans in Congress at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a much greater consistency in 2012 elections.
In this sense, may have the courtesy which will be taken this week, will be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will require both sides very much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that divide the two still.
Durchgesickertes U.S. document Moscow portrayed as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and protection money, out walking, to the Kremlin. As reported in February, the American Embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both police and the state security service, high protection money, so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also by organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical of power '- takes its share of the money that is now moving up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent out under the name of John Beyrle ambassador to Washington, was published on Tuesday by Wiki Leaks on its website.
The memo is based on sources, whose names have been edited.
It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's mayor, and accused him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that would have been demolished in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a construction company, known for years have rejected accusations of corruption, and he has won numerous libel against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television station, when he was asked for a documentary, which suggests that he is corrupt: "It is crazy, it is bad, it is dirty."
Take the believe an incredibly large number of Russians that their society is corrupt. The polls have shown.
But it is extraordinary that, as happened in the report of the ambassador, individuals, and it is unheard of that happening by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link to the government of Moscow with crime has meant that some of them as" disturbing "and come to the conclusion that the government is more like a Kleptokrat acts as a government ," the memo.
"Criminal elements" enjoy a kryshna "(a term from the world of criminals and the mafia, which literally means" umbrella "or protection), the police, state security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as by the whole of the Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB and MVD, the militia are on the second stage."
"The least reduced criminals and criminal inspectors at the lowest level."
"This is an inkompetentes system, in which criminal groups in some areas a gap, because the city offers no help."
The report says that the FSB money by the largest firms and arrested by the police, the small business people.
A source, is, "said that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best for the protection of the FSB and MVD (and not by organised crime), as they do not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"This is why not ask the protection by criminal gangs, as in the past."
The memo noted that, while the collection of funds, the protection of very modest, no; even those who pay to be arrested.
Those who do not pay, closed their business very quickly - on the basis of one or other Vorwands.
Medvedev has spoken several times to fight corruption, has said that he has made little progress.
The message of the memo contains descriptions of men who with suitcases that were probably full of money, go to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption must leave Medvedev on the bureaucrats ," said Satarov named Georgy, director of In, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview.
"But he is part of the bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because there is not a political class in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, accusing the corruption, costing Russia more than $300 billion per year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent study of the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries of "the least corrupt" to "most corrupt" listed).
The revelation of the memos of the American Embassy, which happened after Moscow time late at night, will certainly displeasure within the Russian government, although, as can be accused Luzhkov of Moscow's mistake, it can be for the Kremlin is also an opportunity to assert that will resolve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King on CNN claimed that Putin could be the Wiki Leaks documents a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats have named Medvedev Batman and Robin.
"The truth is that our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country ," he said.
"But to be honest, we would have expected that this would happen with such arrogance, such pressure and so unethical manner, you know."
Khmer Rouge forced veterans to confrontation with the past
In a dimly illuminated, betonierten class room with dirty and abblätternden walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School, the man who has built, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people ," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butchers ', the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, the infrastructure and home to thousands of former soldiers.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, will be challenged longstanding supporters in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum victims public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that tells for the first time a former child soldiers in the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a Community Court of the United Nations and Cambodia for the first time, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, hindered their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia.
"There is still reluctance and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything ," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"It was for life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It is dividing families themselves."
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were executed an estimated 1.7 million people, or they died of disease, starvation or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded in 1979 and overthrew the government Ied Pol Pot, fled the remnants of the regime and its military to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here, they surrendered by December 1998, when the last movement.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary's guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok, the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990 s, when led by an UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993 to the first democratic elections in the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, joining the government, which led to the Kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountain.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial.
As their patrons they no longer protected, ran most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters in the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia and many of the movement in nostalgic memories.
Even if there were a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge their local government posts, because they niederlegten their weapons, the ordinary soldiers poor, illiterate farmers.
"These people have benefited little from the capitulation ," said Sok Leang by the Centre for justice and reconciliation, in Cambodia, in Anlong Veng, public forums holds
"They are enshrined in the agricultural utopian ideology of the regime."
"They grew without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who had joined in 1974 as a teenager, the Rhmer Montrouge, fought in the jungle to Anlang Veng before he niederließ, 1998, to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good ," he said.
"TA Mok has given to eat each."
"But now, because we have to take care of themselves."
The Khmer Rouge tribunal has raised concerns here.
Early next year will try to court, Nuon Chea, president Khieu Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers.
The instructions of the court, it is the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it is not said whether it will follow these four cases, further action.
It has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on the Chaem, 64 years, which have been during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's district manager in the province Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007, it had told representatives of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, they launched the construction of the dam Trapeang Thma, a project that killed thousands of forced laborers probably.
On a hot night in Chaem came from work in the fields of their wooden house on a dirty streets outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun long shadow over the desiccated grass threw in the Chaem refused to discuss their past the Khmer Rouge.
Should the court subpoena them, they would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia is living in peace and stability ," she said.
"There would be no more prosecutions, would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has fled in 1878 by the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation is uncertain, would accuse the court more suspects, although experts and historians to discuss this.
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past ," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk by the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation with the Rouge times means gathering the broken pieces ," he said.
"It is our duty to put this broken parts together so that we can understand everything."
The centre has created the first by the government approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75 page "history of Democratic Kampuchea".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history books for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages of the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Valeak touch, 19, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family in many parts of the book, and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people are sentenced by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process is complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court, and influence, "he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge, a powerful attraction.
High in the mountains Dangrek leads a überwucherter shrubbery and with plastic waste verdreckter a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned after his death in 1998 on a pile of tyres.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile phone sales Rin roadside, said that they did not know much about the man who had been burned.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray ," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later on the day they wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where it will take a more mature bush bananas - in the hope that he will bring their luck.
Belarus is in agreement, not weapons-grade uranium accumulate
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide has announced the Government of Belarus on Wednesday that will collect no longer highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting between the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Council.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to persuade Russia to collect no more highly enriched uranium and seemed achieved last spring a hurdle.
But the U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that have been made in the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus to remove about 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This was the scene of the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, which is due to the sensitivity of the issue of anonymously, about 500 pounds.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuklearem security summit of 47 nations" in April, who had ruled Belarus.
And it was obviously well enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited by the fact that they have a seat on the Nuclear Security Summit (2012)."
"This is proof that it works ," said Ken Luongo, President of Global Security, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years all vulnerable nuclear material.
Since then, has helped the U.S. government six countries to its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuklearem security summit, the White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko, the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium ," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our commodity... We are not dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone ."
"We use it solely for research purposes, that is all ."
Belarus approached, however, a few months ago, the United States, as the tremor interest in meeting of an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated because the material was contaminated by radiation, officials say.
It was loaded into a Spezialzug, of more than 1.300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal of, say officials.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane.
The U.S. government is paying for this effort $14 million, with much of the money flowing into the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was coordinated very carefully in order to build confidence ," to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, which is working on the Global risk reduction.
The estimates James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies that Belarus this year at least £88 waffenfähhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dissolve the joint agreement be camp until 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenkos harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement.
"The progress of this global security issues, heißend, the United States of America and Belarus announced that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens ," she said.
No objections to the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners on Spanish territory to Guantanamo, as indicated in a telegram of the ambassador of the U.S.A. In Madrid.
This reflects the enhüllten Wikileaks and the daily newspaper "El País" (via cable), documents. It adds that the former deputy leader María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, the Spanish Government should be informed, "in order to show that foreign aircraft flying over Spain, are monitored properly."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid to human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, has been indicted, discussed the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy leader admitted the report of the Council met on the sidelines, "said Zapatero and Spain, have to hide in this matter.
", de la Vega, Spain have no objections to the secret flights via Spanish territory. "
"They want to be informed simply" not surprised" unprepared to be ," said Aguirre via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish Government "pay no attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since these are in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez was in January 2007, for its part, the message that the judicial initiative, the declassification of documents from the Spanish intelligence headquarters (CNI) and to request would not block the defence minister on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating or sensitive information ," the ambassador said after a meeting with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States was on the "apparent lack of coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors' as more concerned about the deklassifizierte information of the CNI and Department of Defense.
"This coordination between independent Untersuchern will complicate our efforts to discreet handling between governments ," bemoaned Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended the ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, commented that "although the latter are the Spanish judges incredibly heavily on their independence and would do what they think is appropriate ," he gave his staff instructions, ""sexed up" to avoid rhetorical comments to the tension abates. "
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the way in which the PP in this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American stance our experience teaches us that will no doubt the PP, a suggestion that the government Zapatero's actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as a possible human rights violations, have deliberately ignored or tolerated, will propose capital, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the United States ," he stresses.

People's Party won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona play a crucial role
After the significant increase in Members' votes and the last regional elections, the PP is focusing on the general election - preferred or not. Their expectations are more positive, because the number of votes, the party achieved this in these elections, is normally twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
So the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while it was in the regional elections in 2006, only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the diversion of the voices of the PSC and the capture of the electorate of the PP - should continue, analysts predict that the PP that could rise in the parliamentary elections, the PPC from 8 to 12 members of Congress, while also CiU four (it now has 10) and the PSC have at least 9 Members (25) would lose.
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose a Member of the ERC - currently has three - while ICV its Members or could gain much more.
Should the election calendar, however, the next date with the municipal elections in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP), the language of the scales in order to put an end to the socialist hegemony in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city of Barcelona Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC cities Barcelona, Tarragona, and Lérida Gerona, in which the Socialists do not reach a majority on its traditional allies and ICV (ERC) can draw, will lose.
After the Republican debacle, it is not strange that this party their representation in the local council Barcelona, where they would have to reach 5% of the vote, will lose.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in their share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, and Lérida Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that we can play the main role in Tarragonas swing. There they had before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
The PP en Lérida lies only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Pietro's, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important areas, such as in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus has had a significant increase in the People's Party.
It is currently the PP in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and the creation of lists in so many places as possible.
The Catalan cell, Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven of the police, the intelligence of the Barcelona police arrested Pakistanis and the Nigerians were from Thailand, dschihadistische cell, the different Al Qaeda groups, including the Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) "and" Laschkar e Tauba "(Let) - the latter was the Rin car bombings in Mumbai, which called for 2008 106 deaths - supplied with passports.
The Spanish Interior Minister, these studies are very important, which goes so far that he assured, with "Operation Kampai "the counterfeiting of Al Qaeda worldwide" weakened "and" thus their ability to act ".
The researchers estimate that in the two years, in which the cell in Catalonia, thousands of passports have been sent to Thailand, where these falsified and then to the groups that make up the criminal Galaxie Al Qaeda, have been sent out, so that their "fighters" were able to cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The cell which have been uncovered is not the only one of the jihadist network, which was active in Europe. That is why we have contributed to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units to the investigation. It is not inconceivable that in the territory of the EU in the next few days to similar attacks like the one that was carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona, will come.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Mohammad Ahmad, Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerians Babatunde Agunbiade arrested) was carried out in Thailand, another in the Pakistanis have been arrested Muhammad Athar Butt and Zee Han Ehsan Butt and the Thais Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were guided by the Bangkok from Spain and other European countries registered cell.
The Catalan network - some of it had been made in the year 2009 - stole especially tourists passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents be issued in the name of men aged 25 to 45 years and had to be valid for several years; they were allowed to have no visa stamp.
In research circles stresses that could be demonstrated no connections between the detainee in Catalonia and the attack in Mumbai, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e Tauba" was stolen, one of the recipients of the groups in Spain and then in Thailand forged passports.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that had been sent a few days before the attack in Catalonia, a money transfer company several thousand dollars in purchasing Prepcom Aid cards for mobile phones "invested", which were later by the members of the "commandos" that caused the lives of 106 people, have been used.
The police have seized an extensive documentation.
PP of Ma's calls for a postponement of the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez Camacho, took the opportunity to present their Artur Mas personally conditions in support of his term as prime minister of the Generalitat. These are no different from those already during the election campaign, and let the primacy of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, like a financial compensation agreement, which intends to propose the regionalist leaders at the height of his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan Popular Party began with the safety of Artur Mas, which awarded her the 18 Members who they won last Sunday - a paragraph, which is more than enough to feel. Because the candidate of the civil CiU regionalist party relies on the fact that contains at least one of the opposition parties to vote when he took office.
The future alliances seeking the regionalists in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress, depend on a possible entente with the PP. The talks, the Mas currently with the other party leaders, however, revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the leader of the party PPC, claims that the term "all discourses, which affect the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial balance between State and the Autonomous Region - as in the Basque country, and the party's chief of CiU even a referendum, to be employed.
The two leaders have in common is that they exaggerated the political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and want to abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
With the details of the negotiations on the inauguration of Ma's focus on the part of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - announced the tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today, he will Puigcercós with Joan (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana) come together.
The care home confirmed that the deaths due to "lack of measures" are due
The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not rule out the possibility that their carers of elderly people killed eleven
Those responsible for the care home in La Caritat Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they were, what harm the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurses, who during his work at least eleven elderly people, for which he was responsible, was killed - had inflicted on the body.
The head of the care home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court, and warned that "La Caritat (like those responsible for the deaths),", but "the right and our duty liability are forcing us to the process and the civil liability".
The institution must not only a social being discredited, because they had not seen the criminal activities of the Pflegers pay on time, but now also a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Dilmé Vila acknowledged that the first crime on August 2009, and that he had murdered since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the care home - because he suspected that no doctor examined the deceased personally, but the formalities have been completed due to their age and disease by telephone.
The head of La Caritat verneinte stated flatly that point and that "could have been a lack of action keinerzeit the cause of the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that it "in the legal dispute no evidence for negligent acts of another person than the accused."
The "angel of death" Getaufte confessed to the killings and said the day before yesterday, the first crimes committed on 29 August 2009 and killed one and a half months later, the old lady.
In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime, in which he had used a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat staff, access to the medicines is difficult to control.
The injections of insulin and tranquilizers cocktail, the carers in six of the nine crimes committed in order to liberate the patients with the death of their suffering.
But the results of laboratory tests to prove whether Vila lying and for his first victims actually chose a less cruel death or whether he ausbrannte this from the inside, they verabreichte Bleichlauge, as he had done, according to the confession of three women, between 12 and 17 October murdered.
In La Caritat if the Pflegers no faith, not even as far as the number of murders say that could be more. This is justified by the fact that very different Vila had made statements in court and that it makes no sense to change its approach after eight successful murders.
They say that they did it for that reason, and to clarify the scope of these incidents of the judiciary.
Posturing of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday on the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our response. "
The spreads in the euro Peripheriländer have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
However, we should have the possibility that can deceive the ECB and the euro has appreciated hardly points, leading to concern, not underestimate.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, to the extent that he collapses, recovered, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investors will lose not far from his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank us to make our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, according to which the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably many times in the future, must make.
The Bundesbank called for the lifting of the plan to buy government debt, as if they were ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. It should be maintained only an einwöchiger permanent access.
After the crisis in Ireland, we expect that the current liquidity measures "until at least March" extended and maintain the quarterly contracts with unlimited access to the quarter end to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect that to continue the program to purchase bonds and will spend a means signal.
If it does not meet the expectations created, discarded the reaction of the markets yesterday, and if halstarrig insists on the fact that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, when the bank not to buy government debt securities and collapsed as a result, the markets could be repeated this story tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and consistent.
In May, showed the teeth and on Wednesday said they bought, too, have provoked a collapse of the market.
Yesterday was the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal rather weak.
The government's asset management, there were only 500 million to 5.28%, up from 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal at 30 basis points across the curve and perceptual reflected a change in the markets after Trichet's words.
In Ireland were published the figures from the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at about $10 000 million in the short term and possible further in 15 000. It is time to February, in order to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility, after it had failed to recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the framework of the rescue plan acceptable and to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the government next Tuesday's parliamentary approval for his new budget. Since it does not have the sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has its discourse on the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December. More moderate. There is a political entity, to show that we play together, the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries of Beethoven's ninth symphony.
The Spanish government President, yesterday the action plan, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, the dismantling of the public deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job-creation measures. Measures, the ring in the ears of investors as Vivaldis four seasons.
The dual effect of Zapatero and Trichet, why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared with February was the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank quickly and convincingly, and we will benefit from the surprise result.
Today, there is a crucial auction of a three-year government bonds, which benefit from Trichet effect. That is why we are in a strong demand, which will remove all doubt about our ability to refinance.
For Spain would be the application of an aid plan a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has EUR 40 billion, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, should be in line with our strategy of the Caesar's wife: "Now is not only that, but also his appearances. "
Only the courage, we create!

Red Bull prevails in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The car will be improved with a software in real time.
Since moved in Red Bull in 2004 in the world of Formula 1, their history in this fine universe of the speed of surprises and successes.
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer and sharply rising despite his background during the last few seasons, the sprint last November at the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without the skills of the German pilots and world mayor Sebastian Vettel or reduce the strength of the engine of Renault, is the "secret weapon", the multinational Siemens Red Bull, and created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, is a powerful software for simulation of trials, the German company 2007 for purposes not related to auto racing, on the market.
This PLM described as a computer programme was for the development of assembling chains in factories around the world, energy plants and precise instruments.
Is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is built, the more mistakes and to avoid unnecessary costs.
Plm has the development of the cameras of Canon, the aircraft Sukhoi and the most famous of Nissan vehicles.
Siegfried Rus worm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that the use of this software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time ," the changes and improvements that are found in the race and the tests that can design and implement.
Russwurm contends that employed 1992 in the Rennställen on average ten technicians who could bring in a season at most three or four improvements.
In Red Bulls team employs 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful computer facilities they lead analyses and all sorts of changes to the racing cars.
The Siemens managers, the PLM software is able to analyse all aspects of the racing cars of Red Bull and, with the exception of the engine, which explains why Renault solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the Aero dynamism and security elements be changed.
The changes can be transferred, thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclave in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the Simulators.
The only limit that this crazy is technical perfectionism, the $40 million in 1 - a formula must spend for his race team in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his racing cars in a 50 km away from London.
They are two buildings where visits - particularly of journalists - are limited.
Everything that is happening is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true formula 1 - zweifelslos hero is the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the huge technological resources, which represents the energy drink manufacturers in the service of his participation in the race tracks, there are other players, whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is zero.
The Technologichef the plant, Steve Nevey, stressed that could be said five years ago that the progress in the area of R & D for racing cars, with 50 percent and contributed to the victory of the pilots for the rest.
Today we have changed the share values. The technology accounts for 85 percent of success, while it is estimated that the contribution of the pilots to 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that can be replaced Vettel and Webber never by computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators ."

Sabadell wants his rivals in three years, a million customers' steal '
The executive board member of Banco Sheba Dell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war debts.
Still, he sees a drop in interest rate spreads, the banks with increases in fees and the cost of loans.
Sabadell expected, grasping, in three years, a million private customers - even to a specialist.
Sabadell has found its way to make full use of the next three years, and to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will introduce a new 2011 Dreijahresleitplan.
The goal is to not only survive without public aid from the FROB, but the market share of about a million private customers - 700 000, if you exclude the customers who will lose the bank - to increase. This is the great challenge facing the bank, because until now it has paid more attention to their business customers as their private customers.
This year, it has 250 000 retail and get 50 000 companies.
Its market share in retail is 3.5 percent, while the business customers more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, Austerität, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank, will present them with annual report.
Only a few banks dare to define it in these difficult times and to publish, as are the financial crisis in the world all the plans of the banks.
Sabadell will finish this year their four years ago established safety Optima. This was initially to three years, but the market situation he was extended by one year of operation.
The customers who will leave the savings banks, are the main objective of the bank.
In an APIE organized breakfast Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great scope".
The manager believes that Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult", in two or three years' work "- essential for the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - punished the interest margins - will abate, the risk increases, the need to pay banks and savings banks for their emissions to obtain liquidity, as shifted to offset sagging profit margins at the price of loans.
"The liquidity and funding issues are of a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We have turned the tap, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," Guardiola.
Banesto issued on Thursday, ordering their Filialnetz, the granting of long-term loans and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco Díaz on 22 and 27 November).
The managers also acknowledged that the banks of the Stategie, "to increase the fees ," but" within a competitive framework ".
Sabadells master plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not preclude a corporate business.
Not for nothing that he assured that in Spain "are bigger companies."
"In the coming year will change everything ," he assured.
He stressed that the need for capital "increasingly fierce" and does not exclude the possibility that swing some Spanish financial institutions in red.
He is of the opinion that the FROB could replace Kaptitalaufstockungen in the money market.
He assured that could survive Sheba Dell also a temporary closure of the markets, he refuted the argument of some bankers who predict a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that you can find out anything, but unlike the incidents in June, could be short-term financing on repo transactions and deal with the crisis.
Ceca fills a second wave of merger savings banks from
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility that there could be a wave of mergers of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
When the concentration of the Spanish savings banks, not several savings banks out of the first phase. They were the second round.
On the other hand, assured the Director General of the Spanish savings banks'Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers. The inclusion in the group of Cajasol Banca Cívica cannot be regarded as the second round, it was more about adjustments."
"Most of it is completed. It may be that we have in place of siebzehen thirteen and fourteen, but all major processes are completed. They were of Banco de España, which has supported all transactions, controlled."
In a group of business leaders and managers Aragoniens (ADEA) organized breakfast Olavarrieta resulted from the fact that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we have to be satisfied with the process, the timely in earlier times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España ," he said.
"The transition from 45 savings banks, with an average of 28 000 million in assets, with 17 per 75 500 million is a historically incomparably process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62%, and they are now much higher, so we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement ," he stressed.
Olavarrieta said, "there were a number unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, the Unseriösität and stupidity" revealed, because "Banco de España exhorted us to complete on time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain is one of the strictest financial systems and "perhaps" around the world, and added that those who anzweifeltenn "without deeper knowledge" would do.
The manager said that in the current economic climate "worry" about the situation of the financial institutions and savings banks, which have a "very significant" have undergone concentration, "as quickly as possible".
He reminded that the Spanish banks' stress tests, conducted by the ECB in July, had been very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the favour of, keeping the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tension on the markets have triggered a two-fold response from the government.
On the one hand, has produced José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the removal of the EUR 426 of support for the unemployed, not unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the Barajas airport and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis herausbeschwört said.
How to understand these events?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro.
In Germany, a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, which clashes with the maintenance of the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of the resistance in Europe begins to spekuliern in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is that a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south to leave the euro area.
Second: the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - though it sounds now for science fiction - supported by a majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a restructuring of the Eurostat according to German proposals. This means that more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; penalties for countries that exceed the targets; möglichereweise the default of some countries, as well as the extension of the costs of adaptation measures on the private sector.
The German position is clear and, for some time. That is why there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits, and the German government is a constitutional reform from the sleeves in order to prevent this from 2016.
It was the first signs of the divergence between what was necessary for Germany (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second message, the Central European country, as hinausschob Merkel's decision to rescue Greece.
At that time was heavily criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion completely opposed to a bailout of Greece.
Finally, Merkel in recent days October anew with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union agreements to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, the private lenders to pay a portion of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, Ireland crisis and everything was as follows.
But her proposal, if somewhat sweetened. In the coming months we will be in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line to.
It says all that - even if they have to be taken now unpopular measures - there will not be as of this date the functioning of the euro.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries should be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and, in this case, the private sector is part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we must take a hard line growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it has been led by Spain in boom times, will not be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly to understand it.
It is not only about runterzufahren the government deficit by the year 2013 to three percent.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is to cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm.
And the opportunities that will be offered until will use the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel's hypothesis to create order in their own house, had their way.
But the Germany of red line is there, and it does not seem that would change.
Among the options under consideration is that we would have to leave the country with little serious cramped euro area, cannot be ruled out.
In this case could say Germany still, it warned us.
Sport and rule circumvention
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged by two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos), launched in the game of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled about whether it is an unsportliche act or not, and whether it should be sanctioned possibly both players by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players for a few minutes ago post-match (their team won already clearly) time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, would give the Real Madrid and his group, the two players the mandatory sanction the next league game against the Auxerre comply with and without the cards in the next phase of the game.
Finally, punished the Disciplinary Committee UEFA's coach of the clubs, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card or similar under such circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football.
It has spread so far that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport followed rules.
Part of that debate about the case to the fact that a team of football clubs Real Madrid (the anthem in his precious courage and honor and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) played the main role, and the proportion of Mourinho, the episode has added a more to its long history as theatralischer provocative and technicians.
In any case, the debate about whether this does not contradict the statutes expressly prohibited behaviour to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts of circumvention rule. Indeed, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter should be examined the damage caused to the spirit of sport.
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players an unfair advantage from the opposing team. And it did not happen.
The paradox is the act of players of Real Madrid, that it is not what we normally under false game or circumvention rule, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly, in order to avoid a penalty, but they should be as visible as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players were waiting and took the sanction happily.
Another issue is what kind of took advantage of the offender from the deliberate fouls.
It should be pointed out that neither of the rival in a disadvantageous position were still erheischt advantages for the feigned game, was the obvious result of this action, that the team with fewer players continue to play.
It is also an useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have the players.
The advantage is clear is that the players in the next phase of the Champions League game without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, because it could leave the team at some point. Moreover, the players with this approach a sanction and go in the second cycle of cards, in which they leave for accumulation of cards with a card less than in the first cycle.
It is not clear whether it really is an advantage.
In the end not such practices against the spirit of sport, are among the strategic decisions to pull out of the maximum benefit.
In this case the players wanted to avoid any sanction (that would be a clear case of circumvention rule), they wanted to elect more when they go through this.
They took a strategic decision, without a penalty to avoid or to flee before her.
Although blur the line between inventiveness and regulatory environment, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: two of exclusions and because of the nature of the Regelübertragung provoked.
The damage was caused to the principles of sport by these actions, is less ethical than aesthetic.

Part of the roof Fecasarm Association (with mergers such as pubs, restaurants and leisure, Barcelona), familiar with the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà pointed out, to see the end of the tunnel and that the overall bookings "very strongly", although the customers' scrape together a maximum ".
The fun at the celebration was not decreased, however, no matter who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme is of great concern in the United States
Islamabad is nuclear weapons "faster than any other country,".
Revelations of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The confirmed by the website Wikileaks revealed the content of the correspondence between the U.S. embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, which is of enormous concern to Pakistan's nuclear program in Washington.
On the fringes of clarifying and hefty details that make the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of the accredited American diplomats in Islamabad, reveal that this will not increase the cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear safety, but on the contrary, "", and that the Asian country more unstable nuclear weapons "to a Rhytmus faster than any other country".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that made up the weapons are stored, but their parts in order to make it more difficult for a possible attack their destruction - to put Washington sleepless nights.
These risks include the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit by the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, said: "The proximity of some nuclear plants under attack by the Taliban, the presumptive scattered of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials ."
The large number of people who are implied in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes, not only by the United States, but also by Russia as over-burdensome and reason, caution, considered.
"Pakistan must be strictly gläubiges staff corps of nuclear installations; because of the low educational and cultural levels have extremist organisations more opportunities for people involved in nuclear or missile programmes to reklutieren ," said the expert, Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his American counterpart.

On the hunt for Wikileaks chief
Obama appoints a heavy responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations.
Interpol is a red warning to persecution and detect Assange.
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, who is a complicated maze, in which to investigate the facts only difficult.
Yesterday there was an Interpol "red" warning "locating and persecution" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional orders to arrest.
In addition, it is not new, it dates from 20 November.
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, which must face the Australians in Sweden.
It also assured the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, "the police know where and how they could contact with Mr Assange."
20. The international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of the order, but it was not until yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities.
As things stand. The 188 Interpol countries need to identify and locate Assange, "in order to arrest and extradite him for the time being."
Although Interpol to issue orders for the arrest of a red warning of an affected individual, many member countries according to the organization's red warning as a licence for an Arrestierung - must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreements, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange, presumably.
The move outraged Assanges lawyers who yesterday published a letter in which they were informed that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks, ready to answer the questions via video conference with the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange's exit from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor, with the sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich security chief Beria, Stalin, compared to the corresponding authorisation.
"This is like a hunting, not as a legal persecution ," will be charged in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and claimed his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son - Assange himself in an unknown location, but not in silence.
On Monday he was the head of the Time magazine by Skype from an unspecified location for an interview. The conversation he asked for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the United States.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the United Nations and has not fulfilled by the United States signed international agreements, they would have to resign ," he said.
His opinion was yesterday from the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd ."
"I am not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website ," he told the CNN.
Obama himself has a heavy responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, tasked with preventing new documents revelations.
The attempt by the spokesman of the Präsidenden Barack Obama, Assange to pay less attention, contrary to the views of the conservative politicians and commentators in recent days.
Congressman Peter King, who will lead from January chaired the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility to put on the Wikileaks list of terrorist organizations, "in order to seize their money and everyone who supports or contributes to pursue."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian Minister Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange "murdered" revoked.
"Obama needs to him in a target and not use a manned aircraft or so what."
Anyone who has not apologized, Mike was Huckabee, baptistischer ministers, a former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was, the government leaked information, he is guilty of treason and everything that no execution, is eiine too lenient punishment ," he told the broadcaster Fox.
Puigcercós, with a nod to the Carod shoulders of peace in the ERC
The Republican leader of the party a secret ballot on his continuance in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the General Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time, an internal rebellion in the ranks of the following the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes rudderless ERC.
The party chairman is aware that his threat on the shoulders of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod Rovira. But he also knows that weakened the influence of this sector today as her mentor, and he will not bring the same headaches, like other former currents.
Therefore, trying to win the leader of Esquerre with a nod to the new critics, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For a start announced yesterday that could make the region more than 200 members of the Council of ERC about his stay in office.
With ballot papers, not with superior hand.
If the Carodisten wanted to miss the Präsidenen a parking ticket, could they do this without fear of reprisals.
Indeed, the boss wants to avoid the impression of division, as well as the submission to his person.
In several interviews he reiterated that he would not feel with half of the votes plus one, and he added without giving any percentage values, an outcome "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good.
The Carod someone close call from the president more than just the party office. Insufficient gesture, as Puigcercós controlled the supreme organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to the promotion of resignations, they agree with the Board's action plan between now and May.
They expect that, in the drafting of the document on strategic direction that the leadership on 18 will present to the Council, to be able to participate.
Its intention is to underwrite Puigcercós. In return to this promise, the Congress in the autumn of 2011, what does the leader for a fact.
The party leader of the ERC is of the view that the "Polyphonie" pity the stability and he is seeking once and for all, to bring the organization to wash their dirty linen behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, signed the Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog, symptomatic.
With this in mind, this is a Puigcercós ideologue, the holders of Innovació it for a fact that the party chairman "in exchange for various objectives".
He was one of five, two of which are in the foreground.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the board, so that this represents at least 90 percent of party members that the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet proposes ERC should abandon the principle of the General Assembly as a functioning.
So he verfechtet a reform of the statutes, which should enable the congresses of elected delegates.
By the end of the General Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team who fought in the last two conferences on how obsessed.
Indeed, on the bebenden assembly of 2008 the party leadership with the review of the General Assembly, on a Congress that should concern itself with the reform of the statutes,.
This date is yet to come, as infogle was not the internal Aufruhe of recent years tackling this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors on the wings, could be the time to take up this matter once and for all.

"With your voice, to which we are waiting, now is the time to listen to you ," he said.
The news has been widespread after threatening the 42 Republican senators to block all voice for any law, except for the extension of the tax rebates from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, which was announced at the 42 Republican senators signed a letter, could affect the vote of the Dream Act - legislation and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blockade of the Republicans of Dream Act and other projects, said the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs, he is confident that, if resolved the tax issue, could be drawn up a timetable for the other projects.

"We all agree that must be dealt with the tax issue before the end of the year..."

But the supporters of the law need to adopt the initiative sixty votes, so they have to rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At the time of the organisations of the advocates of a strong influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, said one of them, the Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, he would vote against it and only a Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced its support of the law.
That is why we must get the defenders of the Dream Act, several Republicans on their side, if they decide to other Democrats to the initiative.

Other Republicans who supported in the past the Dream Act, Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said, not to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican, who had voiced support for the bill, John McCain, has not defined its position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate before the biggest obstacles.
Literature with his finger on the wound lay
The second round of the love of the language was a stroll, in which the participants for the strong narrative,
"With the sex in the language, I understand, yes, but... The finger on the wound? What is expected of me?" Asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, the second round of Los placeres de la lengua 'should open up, a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and used on this occasion the subtitle of her question (at another event was devoted to the round table of sex in the language, she said).
The finger on the wound... "brings us into trouble ," spuckte Argentina's Schriftstellein sweet, contrary to the audience, made up mainly of young people who, at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) were able to attend this of Mari Sol Shultz moderierten round table, which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text, which she devoted Gonzalo Celorio, characterized the Shultz and then as a great narrative. Luisa told in the first person and is a champion, the search is to know what a "wound ," and from doctor to doctor, of which they have no answer, but evidence for the guide their narrative.
The Infektologen leaves convinced them: "patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating rapprochement with the clinical trauma theorists, the raubte in the middle of the track your breath, and her but that wound is not a scientific concept, the enthült psychoanalysts the mystery: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative includes sighs of relief and that she "learned from the wound that this truly open and that does not exist". But it is convinced that confuse the desire of the language and their traps.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguans Sergio Ramírez was also an entzückende narrative, which he praised "the invention called, and not in the finger in the wound, but will be discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism, he tells of a famed sorceress who touched the clouds, well travelled men did or the wiederherstellte by a girl lost virtue. The narrative made an U-turn and reported from America, the great novel, it was not on his own singing, and he cited Bernal Díaz del Castillo, the abundance of the Eroberen criticized told stories.
"Cervantes, all of us (the writer), spottete invited the false witnesses who appeared in the stories set out to be true, but in some other way would have been the story of America never - with imagination, the lost even the shame."
However, he stresses, "the madman and liar who imagine things best", and closer to the truth and lie to each other, where we no longer know which side is part of the narrative, where the fictitious literature to the summit.
He calls the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him, to be what is told."
As was Montero Mayra, annotated and praised the writer, the diversity of interpretations, the invitation to the FIl round table'the finger in the wound "had contributed.
The Kubanerin and Puertorikanerin devoted their part of the major wound of social violence that affects their country - as the whole of Latin America - as a result of the fighting the drug trade.
"I believe that good literature, poetry, good songs a tacit, not deliberately planned commitment ," she said, after she had emphasised that literature and binding communications between the author and readers like a" chemical reaction ".
The evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution is also "the finger of the writer in the wound of the author" hevorhob.
He said that in a fast-moving world of the intellectual habits and the control of the consciousness of dogma, forgotten and that "behind every confirmation of a'no', and behind every denial a yes."
"In our thoughts and the reality of the situation, we must qualify: Nuancieren often means, to put our finger on the wound and harassing those who feel a lot happier if they are in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in ready-made ideas without nuances, harassing and powerful men who prefer to the world in black and white said he and invited to rediscover a sense of the letter.

Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in Endspielen, he has seen Aufs (and in his career, but he has had three important games, and so far has kept it well, and this opportunity is of particular importance for him.
The Argentines has played up the medal for the second champion, he is not a step behind the victors and amazingly, he fought with the same team consecutive Endspiele.
The santistische strategist peaked in the first end game as a coach in the Torneo Apertura '2002', when the Morelia del in the driving seat, with whom he learned Toluca with 4-2 against a major defeat; later, in the '2003' Clausura he reached the crucial match, which he lost, with 3-1 against Rayados.
With Laguna Santos on the Torneo Bicentenario '2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, had to Rubén received a setback, as was the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of the game ended in a draw, but the penalty he came forward with 3-1 and had two opportunities to take his title, but ultimately failed three of the eleven players and the game went on a 4-3.
Rubén had two Endspiele with the Diablos Rojo and Monterrey, one of his major rivals, lost. That is why he would not repeat the disaster and rid themselves of the bad magic, in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he stressed that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I would like to be champion, I would like to break no statistics for a club, for my affection, I hingebe me, and that is why the title to me, but what happened in the past, is the most important thing ," commented on the tax man, when questioned him about the lost Endspiele.
The end game, it is still very much in mind, he assured, learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from this is that he blew until the end of the referee, we can celebrate, we are on the line, the players, because the last time we were prepared with two Elfmetern, getting out, and I think that is a lesson that is not over until the game, there is no cause for celebration."
To know that this series of penalty shootout could be decided, does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive in the penalty shoot-out, we would like to finish in the regular season game, but sometimes there is no alternative, and we must be prepared, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately, we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the intense desire to keep the title in the hands of the left us something for the final, and we hope that it will not happen this time."
It is in Romanso power, not to be only the second champion and cost for the first time the glory of the title.

450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro Quebec has approved by mutual agreement project planning firms $450 million in contracts for the hydroelectric project Eastmain- 1 A Sarcelle Rupert.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the most important, namely the project management, has received a total of $295 million without tender.
The consortium, called "gérance Énergie", was 2004 as a side effect of the decision of Hydro Quebec, the private sector accountability, this important to entrust hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of $5 billion, formed.
In early 2005, earned the consortium "gérance Énergie" the lucrative contract, without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois the embrace of business consortia a serious ethical problem, raising the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase.
"This is a new way of a conspiracy and refuted the competition."
"That means that instead of taking fixes rather than on secret manner in an open manner ," said yesterday Simard Sylvain, representative of the PQ, at the press conference.
Early in the morning Simard had raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems to him hard to understand how to serve the public's interest in this way.
Ressourcenministerin Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon, when she vehemently denied that it had acted on this treaty is a stitch-up.
"I stand by my line ," she railing, nourished by the PQ" dishonest ", and" lack of rigour ".
She said that it was "the least" that the PQ apologize.
The model of the consortium is common practice.
It is usually a time such temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in a bid to a tender for a complex project.
The project "East Main" has a high level of complexity in terms of its labour scale.
The construction is under way and should be drawn up until 2012.
However, it has been awarded the contract without a competition could take place; it had already made in negotiations.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in the Quebec even with relatively simple projects no longer an exception.
As the newspaper Le Devoir "noted last week, is in a civil engineer and advisory system used model of the consortium of government investigations.
A short screen of the Quebecer company register makes it possible to identify more than 200 consortia, of which appear to be of some duration consistent.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau is working in partnership with the majority of its main competitors, CIMA +, Génivar, SNC lava Lin or Roche and Tecsult, together.
Any link, and there are several dozen, at one and the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
What the consortium "gérance Énergie", Normandeau minister stressed that "is subject to the territory of the Baie James special labour dynamics and that is Hydro Quebec this fact since the 70 s in a particular way '.
Réal Laporte, the major employers of the Société d énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that the nose on the fact that frowning has approved the project led to agreement.
"If you are an invitation to tender and there are few applicants, will your prices."
"You have two options: either you do the people who are in this Walmart and saying you: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that is not the price, but the expertise of the people ," said Laporte.
The consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50.000 of the Parti Québécois received $.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro Quebec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain- 1 A Sarcelle Rupert.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts, the companies or their subsidiaries including, in particular, laboratories, resources have been allocated between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC lava Lin had tightened up 22 contracts per se, Génivar Tecsult had received 16, 14 and 10, Dessau without their participation in the "gérance Énergie" mitzurechnen.
All of these contracts were negotiated.
It is worth a total of $344 to 449 783, including the contract with "gérance Énergie" about $295 131 in 564.
Sylvain Simard had indicated that the four firms, which make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM Axor) and the "libéral Parti du Quebec is well known ."

Barometer verantworungsbewußten consumption - The "green" label is not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence among the main actors of sustainable growth, however, nor to the unmarked stamps or organic labels to steer his election.
It is a shame, although basking in a media-oriented universe, where abound of information in favor of a more responsible consumption only: the scoreboard responsible consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, a deficiency, which impede his commitment, as the first reading, which was held yesterday.
Although they have encouraged the use of the so-called socially compatible products in 2010, the Quebecer, however, those who try to sell it to pay little credit.
Two thirds of the population Quebecer admits, in fact, the commitment of the firms as little as the green corporate advertising, betrays the responsible consumer Centre at the University of Sherbrooke sophisticated measuring instrument.
Another result: half of the consumer doubts the reliability of the official, the supposedly fair products have made allowances, but also the credibility of the products and brands, who declare themselves as environmentally aware, the scoreboard.
Following the same pattern is the discourse of the politicians on the subject of only 14.6% of the population Quebecer seriously.
The information on responsible consumption, it seems, however, important to stimulate consumption this segment, which is now being revived by nearly one third of the Quebecer consumers.
In fact, viewed as dampening emptiness and dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is after the higher price of the products, the second part of the barometer identified brake.
In addition, a third of the Quebecer indicated the performance of green products and services to them is trying to suspicious.
According to a different communication had already changed more than half of the consumers in 2010 and changed their habits of the brand of one or more products in order to give their conviction.
According to Eurobarometer had preferred it to 61% of their purchases of dealers city area and encourages the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of the environmentally friendly consumption had reached this year, 64 of the maximum value of 100 - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of the recycling, which is trying to reduce its left traces in the environment, he cares about animal welfare.
But the social and environmental consciousness seems to be still in his car, so the scoreboard: just 28% of the Quebecer have indicated, in 2010, public transport or the Mitfahrzentrale to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also advocated by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which keeps the stereotypes.
Government loan for the takeover of eXcentris
The Quebecer government, which has been asked by the Société Angus and the Parallèle companies to participate financially in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris, with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a loan deal.
The developers society Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of about seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois, eXcentris cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, to entrust this back its cineastischen function, not what they have demanded.
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, however, to their own conditions.
Instead of the expected Quebecer donation offers the government a bond in lower than initially expected, which could create a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least in the view of the state from the scaremongers entnehmbaren sources.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the Bittgesuch has been corrected since the overall, it once again.
A proposal, together with an action plan were already by the President of the "Société de développement of entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, sent to St Pierre, the minister in charge of the eXcentris acts.
Several days ago, he had to send a final technical report.
The proposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, however, on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to this.
In any case, seems to have been pushed the premise of the Heads of State donation really on the side.
Let us remember that had made the Quebecer owners community of cinemas and cinema complexes against direct government investment to support the takeover of eXcentris by made the argument that the Culture Ministers have to provide financial aid for real estate projects, he also have other cinema halls.
Several other participants in the market segment of the market, there have, however, by contrast, substantial economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois was reported after the construction of the self-financed cinemas over ten years, with great difficulty, the authors cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception from the treasury.
The lack of cinema halls, the independent films in Montreal, is more than obvious, and eXcentris knew to keep its clientele.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, a privately financed campaign in which they hope that a sum of $700 000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle.
The aim of the prospective purchasers, the three cinemas on 27 February next year with a demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "hommes et des dieux 'to open.
Christian Yaccarini but the newspaper "Le Devoir recalled" and not ignored, he and his group of the enviable proposals, which they did.
The secret of komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted
The new, American diplomats, who were told by Wiki Leaks, open up about what the United Nations under the Minderwertigkeitskomplex the Canadians to the Americans, however, with the same blow the mixing of the latter to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters at the ballot kanadisch American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce its budget by 2009.
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were told yesterday, offer more juicy details as the substantive content, in which the very people.
One of 22 September 2008 carved, i.e. in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage in full swing, reported, which do not join the United Nations more of their political leaders discussed operations.
To the astonishment of David Wilkins, in Ottawa, the American ambassador.
Mr Wilkins offers a variety of channels this situation.
"The Canadians led to an almost innewohnender Minderwertigkeitskomplex, perhaps the Canadian political leaders have much to talk about the issues of everyday life, as the United States in this election the can (as in 1988 when the campaign on free trade) ," he says.
The United Nations, he concludes, is "the proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to speak of him".
The ambassador understands the "deafening silence" the less, since the two countries have close political and economic relations.
"Logically ," he assessed," it should be the ability of a candidate of a party, and much more of a party leaders for holding such a crucial relationship, which has in the polls as a key factor in the spirit. "
The other, this sense of importance is in on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, broadcast, communication is to prepare the President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Their trip will help ensure the continuation of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February, which will give Canada its first deficit after more than a decade known, which is due to a recovery program in the 30 to 40 billion dollars ," describes Breese.
Nowhere did he mentioned that the government's parliamentary session before Christmas had to be postponed, so that Parliament would be overthrown by the coalition and would be the case with the opposition parties on the quality of the proposed recovery programme.
Further, in January 2008 and carved from the ambassador Wilkins written communication Washington from the increasingly negative image that the broadcast on CBC, dramatic series by the United States.
The ambassador is worried about programmes such as Border, Mosque calls on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly" list can observe or payments for the purposes of Muskelprotze of CIA interrogations.
Yet another communication widely reported, as asked Hillary Clinton in her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting on whether Europe is prepared to accept some detainees from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question, however, on the basis of an individual "case by case" decision.
Àm at the end of the meeting, described as ", he has given the state secretary a paper on Khadr Omar, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslims. "
"The Secretary of State has pledged to look through the acts again".
Finally, we note that Discussions passions on the Web site Wiki Leaks.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely related adviser, declared on CBC that the people responsible for this massive leak "should be killed".
He had talked to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
A global plan for renewal of the lighting
The U.N. has yesterday in Cancún a plan to renew the lighting of households, Trade and Industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFCs), equivalent to almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes his position in the concrete steps of major projects, the implementation of the U.N. in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries.
After yesterday's plan would be the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) can be avoided, because of the lighting of the earth, CFCs, if the weißglühenden pears, which has a monopoly of between 50% and 70% in the market, by fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (LED) would be replaced.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of global vehicle fleets.
In Copenhagen last year had to exhaust the big emitters like the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans, which should lower the global CFC emissions from 53 to 49 Gt Gt.
This review should be deducted, however, still 5 Gt to stabilize between now and the year 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent this is out of control.
In the weißglühenden pears show 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% of the light.
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen, reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs this energy demand once again twice.
The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average between 6000 to 10.000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those expressed by the manufacturer Philips this week on the market, the company has also participated in the study - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, which gives an indication of the savings of the replacement plan, which is to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that iese completely new light bulbs very little heat, they can work with a rule.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts have pointed out that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury and therefore must dispose of hazardous waste, which is not always possible in the developing world, except the producers are an adoption agency.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal plants that emit more mercury to produce the weißglühenden pears wasted electricity.
In the United States alone, these coal plants 25.000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits, which would account for each country, thanks to this international program.
Indonesia would save as, for example, a billion dollars annually in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose edification Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.

Clotilde Reiss affair: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediating role for Syria
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who in Iran for "espionage" was detained, the French public in breathing, enabled the diplomacy in alert and focused the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the attentive eyes of diplomats from the United States.
The Wiki Leaks and obtained by the newspaper Le Monde durchgesehenen American documents give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had told the Americans that his strategy, which went as far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of Wanderern).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman the release of Majid Kakavand, have an in France, and by the American justice due to trade with material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program Iraners wanted to Gegeleistung.
Finally, they put the way in which to manipulate the French Presidency has tried to use the media to make this the idea, the Syrian President Bachar Al Assad have played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss, in a harsh light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
An on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatic telegram entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hijackings ."
François Richier, Elysée adviser in strategy issues addressed in the company of Mr Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay in North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They said the French method.
The advised the Americans to do everything we can to rückzuführen their own nationals who were forcibly detained in Iran.
"Noise ," they said," articulated loudly and clearly and without letting up, "the words' basic human rights, ""innocence,"" immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to bring the Iranian regime in embarrassment that respects very sensitive to its image.
"This is all the more so, since you ask the Iranians not to do it ."
Because "silence solves nothing ," over the discussion about attempts to unauffälligem routes, the Iranians' master in evasive manoeuvres ".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of a "normal," Iranian tactic: "hostage to political blackmail ."
He announced the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (on 16 August should come into being, on the day they take refuge in the French Embassy) "demand the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" ($230.000) bail.
And he said, the Elysée am anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will get worse ."
The Iranians could "arrest in the near future, another of the roughly 1.800 French citizens who live in Iran ," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been sacked twelve days from prison, is still in Iran.
The information was circulated: the Iranians Kakavand Majid, whose extradition to the United States due to illegal trade in empfindlichem electronics materials to Iran, has been sacked after a judge's decision in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, questions on this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, the illegal Iranian networks of the nuclear programme of material, the release of Majid Khakavand bad news.
France has taken a horse trading in purchasing?
The liberation of the Iraners against the French woman?
During a meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, not only was "completely surprised by the decision of the judge ," but also tried to rebel against.
"There has been a heated exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot Marie), "the French government cannot change the past ," he says.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Kakavand Majid under "strict supervision" of the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, again, the American diplomat, the Iranians "are currently in the chair of the Iranian embassy buildings in Paris ."
While not without damaging the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran the Elysée his efforts, through statements by the media and organised "flight testing "judging, the Syrian President Assad Bachar Al playing a" significant "and" influential intermediary role ."
The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony and that the manipulation of the fruit, as reflected in several press articles in the official French version.
One of 25 August 2009. The datierendes telegram "media blitzkrieg of the French authorities".
Why there was so much "thanks," Mr Assad, wonders the Paris embassy.
"Despite their declarations of Lobpreis, the French authorities to secretly, that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians".
The document also deals with the reasons that have brought the Elysée to indulge this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aims to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," he said.
2008, launched a policy which at that time "was perceived by many critics votes in France and abroad as premature and undeservedly ."
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "is trying to bring Syria, can achieve what we laud by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "discord between Syria and Iran ."
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August had entrusted to François Richier her, "of course we do not know whether the Syrians what happens".
"But we have, despite everything, they thanked."
"This should at least cause confusion for the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss, on 16 May 2010 to France.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives in the Elysée.
In a statement he is grateful to the president of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role for the release of our compatriot ."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government is a law, known as the "Cinderella", which will allow young people to play after midnight Games online, by blocking access to them, as suggested by government officials.
A draft law, which is expected to call on the online games operators to prevent young people under the age of 16 after midnight access to these Games, will be presented to Parliament in December, schilderten representatives of education and family ministries.
"Many children play Games all night long and then have difficulty learning in school and also to lead a normal life during the day."
"We are of the opinion that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep to ," said Jo Rin, with this draft law betrauter ministerial representative of the French news agency Agence France Presse.
The online Games were then again from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies would have a year's time to prepare for the application of the law, he clarified.
The government fasser as well, to ask the manufacturer, the daily for access to these Games to reduce the time limit for those young people whose parents to ask a question, the person responsible.
He will also allow those who want it, Gratisprogramme available that allow the Internet to limit time spent.
South Korea is one of the most "wired" countries, and the newspapers regularly report by different, with some heavy Internet use related events.
The country is also undisputed champion in global online Game competitions.
In November, had won South Korea with 58 other nations four gold medals in the World Cyber Games.
The 2018-2022 World Cup, FIFA appoints the Olympic Games
In a corruption suspect appoints the executive committee of FIFA on Thursday the host countries in the world championships in 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice, in which the Rangeln for influence and threaten to push the lobbying the technical criteria in the background.
One thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the grasp of the FIFA is in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands).
The 2022 edition will be something exotic; hopes the International Football Federation, after the first of its kind on the African continent in 2010 new countries (Australia, Qatar) win for himself, or his office in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to pursue.
The list of personalities, the delegation of (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beck mothballed, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of a world championship.
The machinations behind the scenes are threatening to hold until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of the candidates.
After the evaluation report of FIFA, English, Spanish, Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees at the election so important.
The Sunday Times, the achievement of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) was at the beginning of the revelations, as well as opportunities for their own country, the cradle of football, can ruin, which was allowed to carry only once the World Cup, in 1966.
The BBC had given the ground again on Monday, when they had broadcast a documentary report, the three senior members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz Issa and Hayatou under fire.
Reason enough to upset the FIFA and the leaders in English, which had operated primarily with David Cameron over the last few weeks, an intensive lobbying.
The head of government hopes for a repeat of his predecessor Tony Blair successful chess train, which was made in 2005 for the organisation of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
This would be sufficient intensive use, to enhance the image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain Portugal does not lack assets with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (82 World Cup in Spain, the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 92, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture.
But the economic and financial drawbacks of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become the weighty outsiders, rise.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided, however, the unumwundenen suggestion to the Bezichtigungen the English press "unfair competition in the run-up to the vote" denounced by the Committee members.
"We bewirft it with dirt, they are trying to embarrass them ," Putin railing.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, to be the logical favourites.
First world economic power, FIFA headquarters of the main sponsors, the country seems a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up separately on a very good project.
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA are eagerly awaiting approval of the 2026 World Cup in China, the Asian opportunities to 2022 lapses.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn with the leaders futuristischer stadiums out all the stops, FIFA their expansion in the direction of new areas, however, these two countries a greater risk, for sure.
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea among the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (due to the time delay) suffer, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
The Offenkundigkeit second mandate:
De Gaulle had whittled away.
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
Nicolas Sarkozy and even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next.
The current head of state will be making a candidate in 2012.
But the Offenkundigkeit is the side of the Mysteriums, which evokes the presidential function, not.
So we have to do so, as if the doubts from now on.
In one, as well as in the other direction.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without believing themselves.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy in serious Tone, his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011".
He Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians from the perspective of "two mandates" would let it be known that had spread a little Fieberhaftigkeit.
This was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The president was simply remind you that will limit the constitutional amendment of 2008 the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement that no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have the worst case, seven and a half years with me, or at best ," he told them in July 2009.
A new in May 2010: "does not mean that I do not think about the stage."
His words of yesteryear do not make him more candidates than the previous day, no less.
Should they cause, then from a double.
The acceleration of the Wettlaufes the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal, who is Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal themselves.
On the contrary, it is obvious his candidacy in 2012, which was adopted by many members of the PS as early warning to the challenge.
The bad opinion polls on the other side.
For the first time, the voters of a candidacy by François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to the poll BVA L Express) prefer.
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," responded immediately and cautious in the context of the Prime Minister.
"If he would be a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe, to be able to win ," corrected Alain Juppé, who has resigned with the Offenkundigkeit.
Euro: the ECB is forced to retain their purchases of government paper
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how exiting from the crisis, or at least announce the layout of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures, the end of the year to conclude.
The duty of the European debt crisis, the Central Bank in Frankfurt cannot afford without a doubt, even today, to put more than tense situation in the European bond markets, not to cause the deterioration.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday at a press conference the stance taken by the ECB, active role in favour of the resolution of the state budget deficit.
It has not dared to say whether they thought the central bank could do even more, for example, by boosting its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my reasons for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean Claude Trichet, President of the ECB had been an eloquent speaker of the previous day in Brussels during his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament for its projects, but rather to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities in the secondary market "dismal" and that we in the Assembly on Thursday "to see how the decisions".
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically low level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the treasure chamber of the ECB last week to around 1.35 billion euros.
According to leaks and some traders should they have made yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government paper.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 purchases of 67 billion euros.
Among the dealers will be questioned the anticipation of a further implementing the purchase price in any way (see page 29).
The economists expect no more remarkable change.
If the bond deals of over three months from the arsenal of the ECB, will be to create the latter still unrestricted cash reserves to freigiebige type, over a period of a week for up to three months.
The economists bracing themselves today that is going to expand this measure for some months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will amend its programme on essential nature".
"Otherwise, they run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term ," says Michael suspected Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"For the first quarter of 2011, provided for progressive withdrawal seems more likely ," anticipates, Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In its intervention in the market for government debt, "the ECB should aufrechthalten such a purchase volume of bonds, which revived the sluggish market ," adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the markets of the national debt in the euro zone, the central bank has no other choice than to maintain their presence in the market.
"They must at any price to the Steller lack of investors in the market and will act as the hasty enthusiasm on the weakest states paid to prevent returns ," verve yesterday an important bond holders.
Because if interest rates are soaring, would prevent the states even more to reduce their debt or to stabilize.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Berlusconi government in Italy in coverage
After a few weeks earlier for disturbing Italy has the situation yesterday with the decline of the Eckzinsen 10 years a little relaxed.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional chairman Giulio Tremonti, the situation as "unentzifferbar" and qualify him with a "unpredictable" weekend, expect to hear what the person concerned, however, immediately denied.
On Tuesday, in any case, would have achieved the gap with the German interest rates his record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out in his Council of Ministers that the discrepancy in the German interest rates by 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni advocated, had to be "seriously concerned" by the "market turmoil 'and a possible contagion from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro zone, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy and Portugal ," said Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In other words, the problem is the absence of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtigen tax receipts, the state is in danger, not to be able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future is expected to be an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... Although calculates that the Senate before budget with 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, calculated as the EU Commission, will make up the budget deficit next year to 4.3% of GDP (as opposed to the governments of the predicted 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (2.7%).
Hence the turmoil to a new collective budget, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, must be adopted new austerity measures ," says auditors Olli Rehn.
On the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are settled, we already have for a long time ," said Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustees of the International Monetary Fund, which is charged with the IMF with Italy.
"At the moment there are no problems, not on short-term or long-term view, because of Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, and A. R.) calls for lower stabilisation progress than from other countries ," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There remains the question of the political Unstetigkeit.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure of the Chamber of Deputies, which secured preferred could be organised the elections at the end of March.
It is therefore a little good period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the development of crisis-management measures
Christine Lagarde stressed it was only yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think we showed it on Sunday afternoon and evening: Europeans think clearly, are engaged and prepared, its currency and to defend its currency area ".
Although relatively completely - the withdrawal yesterday, in the interest of the European government bonds was grist to the mill of the governments and the ECB.
From the beginning of a normalisation can not yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it can debt to Portugal, perhaps the most effective target of speculators nowadays, lower.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which rests on the banking systems ," the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, given that "the political time passes much more slowly than those of the markets".
The European countries, both this gap as well as the danger lurks, are well aware of the discussions aimed at strengthening the existing crisis-management measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected by finance ministers and, by extension, with their counterparts of the G20 are progressing well.
And in terms of the meetings of Ecofin and Groupe early next week.
The ECB meets today.
In the plan is the lot of unconventional measures to support the strengthening of the countries of the euro zone in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As for the EU Stability Fund, has begun its Executive Director Klaus Regling said on Tuesday in Singapour his Asia tour to inform investors in the Far East on the developments with regard to the crisis in Europe.
If this is not the purpose of his visit to express fund-raising, as he put it on the ground.
The first Werpapierausgaben on the part of the EU Stability Fund are planned for next month.
Yesterday was entrusted to an official representative of the American agency Reuters, the United States supported a possible increase in the additional, direct involvement of the IMF mobilized funds.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, for its part, structural reforms, to take over, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms, in addition to the austerity measures designed to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid go down a different path, as did Greece and Ireland.
Both one and the other is to avoid at any price, ask for international assistance to before they set up their own budget and corrective measures have decided on essential structural reforms, the them back to the trust.
The European investors, in turn, chatting about the options available to speed up the process of the markets of bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on 24 November in transit in Paris, had produced the first to the idea that if the 750 by Europe and the International Monetary Fund mobilized billion enough, the Union would not hesitate to pick up again.
The economists at Barclays Capital, the market of the European public debt is at the forefront of player, judge, an extension of the 100 billion would be enough, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
This means there is money: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently stands at 60 billion euros.
An Advisory Council, has all the chances, examined closely in European capitals.
Above all, get worse if the market conditions.

The DGAB recommends the airline passengers to contact their airline.
The airports in the south London Gatwick and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial vignettes
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile de France in full swing, it rains.
At least in the discussions.
Recall, in particular, the $23 billion for the Grand Paris metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to guide the start of construction of the SGP, has declared a state of the capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme is the amount that would allow the SGP and to give the markets a portion of the financial sum on her Zweifachen.
Today it is finally to first projections.
The supplementary budget for 2010, looked at this morning by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, which contains measures to raise the first part of this money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of office on the Ile de France.
The former, remove Article 15 of the bill, "for the benefit of the public service broadcaster Société du Grand Paris".
This is calculated: "The product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year ."
Zweitere is an overhaul of existing corporate taxation: "to modernize them in order to increase the resulting from their product and to entrust this increase the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it?
A mystery.
This amount is calculated not in the text.
Of the 4 billion is far away.
"It is said that the fiscal resources will be added to the 4 billion euro capital endowment, which will be paid by the state and the Société du Grand Paris gradually for the project ," says the explanatory statement.
The SGP is not this system at all offensive.
"Since the moment when we recorded revenue (the two taxes, that R.), the design over three years and then take heart from the 4 billion ," he says.
"This will be noted in the budget and deducted gradually".
The SGP estimated that will begin in 2013, taking 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, which promised 4 billion people will be able to look for a long time, had a right to parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rachsüchtige hackers is spies and
The affair Wiki Leaks has a double meaning.
On one side, it turns out the obvious scandal, a scandal, which is simply a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy, the Beziehunge between states, the public and the press.
On the other hand, it announces radical changes at international level, and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But we are moving in the right order.
The first aspect of Wiki Leaks is the confirmation of the fact that any of the intelligence produced a file (x) any nation composed entirely of Zeitungsausschnitten.
The "extraordinary ," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw anything more than what we had to read for months anyway in any particular x Journal (except for those whose owners Berlusconi), and the appalling karikaturierte Gaddafi's profile was Kabarettkünstlern already for a long time for their skits.
The rule, not the secret files from previous news, is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a library dedicated esotherischen publications, you will see that each plant (the Grail, the mystery of Rennes le Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) exactly the repeated what has been written in previous works.
This is not, therefore, that wants to publish the author occult texts (no research yet, therefore, that he did not know, not to turn to when news of the exist), but because those who dedicate themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing else than to believe what they know and have already confirmed what they have learned.
This is also the best mechanism of Dan Brown.
Similarly, the secret files.
The informant is lazy, lazy and (or limited mental) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be, for example, editor of Libération), the only considers to be true, he acknowledges.
The Top Secret information on Berlusconi, who had sent the U.S. embassy in Rome, the Staatsdezernat were the same as those who had already Newsweek published the week before.
So why was made such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier?
On one side, which stipulate that any educated person knows already that the messages - can call at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the Government each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a few small representation tasks, have turned into espionage centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that acting to ignore it.
Still, the fact to repeat it publicly, the task of hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second: the idea that can tap a x any hackers geheimsten the secrets of the most powerful country in the world, poses a significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats.
The scandal also produce fewer victims, rather than the "executioner".
But we are of the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, to Orwell's times, was able to concentrate all power as a Big Brother, every gesture of his subjects are controlled.
Orwell's prophecy could prove as absolutely right, where you can monitor any movement, thanks to the telephone, making any transaction, visited the hotel, the motorway and so on; the citizens would become the victims of the eyes of the total power.
But if you consider what is happening today that can escape, not even the secret Krypten the power of the control of a Hackers, listening to the control of, unilaterally and will zirkelförmig.
The power to control every citizen, every citizen, or at least the hackers - acquired as avenger of the citizen - can bring the secrets of power.
How can a power that is no longer able to maintain their own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel said that is a real mystery a hollow secret (and a hollow secrecy can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically a secret free of Geheimis because it exposes the public sphere; to lay in the styles of Wiki Leaks openly that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets, means to deprive them of any power.
Wiki Leaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Angela Merkel, but on the other hand, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this violation that has been inflicted on such a huge power?
It is obvious that the states in the future no longer reserved for information online - which would amount to the street corner angeklebten posting.
But it is also clear that, with the current technology is to be hoped in vain, to be able to keep confidential reports on the telephone.
Nothing is easier than figuring out whether and when to move a head of state in a plane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
How could be maintained in the future, and only to some ears certain relations?
I know very well that my prediction sounds at the moment, science fiction and romanhaft, but I feel compelled me to imagine the government agents, in a secret way preoccupied with uncontrollable march routes, moving their communications anywhere else than the mere memory in order, and the few written information that they have, in the verbergend footwear sales.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically has enjoyed the espionage attempt by Watergate less success than Wiki Leaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology now like a cancer, backwards.
A century after the Telegraph wireless communications, reconstructed the Internet with a Telegrafen (telephone wire).
The video cassettes (analogue) had enabled the researchers film, a film auszukundschaften band for band by was able to lift it from behind, spulen and all the secrets of the assembly, while the numerical (CDs) allow nowadays is to jump from chapter to chapter, macro portions.
With the high-speed trains you drive within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires by plane, including switching three and a half hours.
It is not unusual that policy and communications technology on car and horse.
One final observation.
In earlier times tried to understand the press, which have been forged between the secrets of messages.
Currently, the messages, the confidential information from the press.
Climate: amount as France its financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to comply with the quickly resolved financing promises (also known as "fast start" funding or premature), which were carried out by the developing countries.
And already are exposed the rough French blandishments.
With the Copenhagen Treaty have committed themselves to developing countries, 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France (1.26 billion euros (420 million) per year.
At the opening of the COP16 has learned the EU out all the stops to convince its partners from the fact of its commitment to the fast start funding detailgetreuer approach: report of its Member States, press conference, great side events, distributing leaflets.
The operation transparency is noteworthy and I feel valued for its real value: the developing countries and civil society would like, if developed countries were all the same thing at the same level of precision.
The EU announced, released in 2010 2.2 billion euros, which it puts on the right track to Respektbezollung commitment of $7.2 billion in 2012.
If you look into the details, but things are a little more complicated.
This money should, according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" to ensure that has been tabled an additional commitment, without benefit to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain members states, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considers to be the best.
The EU Commission has chosen, for example, a benchmark for those of 2009: the international financing will be retained, and within the framework of the "fast start" funding over three years to 150 million.
Other countries have similar guidelines, either in a year or about conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France was of the opinion that the financing "of all new projects" 2010 "new and additional".
In other words: there are no benchmarks in the spending of the previous year or at the global level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of French support for developing countries stable (or decrease) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional" to keep funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
Moreover, there is no rule, and everyone chooses its calculation method.
Some, such as France, 1 Euro borrowed as being equivalent to 1 Euro donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the trouble is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects, which are based on maximum technology) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro, the captured as equivalent to a donated Euro... They should be counted only the cost of borrowing for capital commitment as a donor country (that is, the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing other than in accordance with the following comment: "respected" its commitment of EUR 420 million, 91.5% of loans (389.8 million) and donates 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince themselves.
France is the only land of the EU that loans.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) to their commitments to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union in 1 Euro to fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and understands including a comparable effort.
More beautiful hocus-pocus!
All in all, France in his fast start funding with a double deception: part with a Weiterentwicklkung the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France will succeed, believe that there are 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promises and save 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it appears that it was Bercy, who carried out the arbitrage) could have a negative effect on twice; once the EU (why the other member states with the donations, but if there is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, since not all developing countries are completely...
The chapter on premature, only a small issue on relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions on the climate.
But it may be too much of the drop in the machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year premature funding.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for his commitments and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring the discussions on the subject of long-term financing forward (another key topic) and at the moment: you can escape the Verrechenbarkeit "or" not the kind of recording its loans.
France could change its position in order to be as advanced in terms of the issues, as is the case with other things.
The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and his vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would increase by nature, the international confidence, which is necessary for further discussions.
The alarm - of children's pesticides
A child of 10 years, on the day of 81 different chemical substances, a this Wednesday by the Association of Générations futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect generations) published study.
The association, said that its results ", given the small number of samples analyzed no statistically significant value, but character illustration of the problem ", between July and September, usually within four years or so, bought from a child to the meals consumed food plus a meal in supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
The typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products and three 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as biscuits from laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The authors review is stunning: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possibly or probably carcinogenic (and five karziogen classified as safe, as well as 37 substances with Endokrinin glitch, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Even if in the now all of the cases the legal limit for each chemical, not be exceeded, individually, so removed from this survey is very good that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogens or substances with Endokrinin glitch, is worrying ," said the association.
At the breakfast contain the butter and milk tea with more than ten of potentially carcinogenic residues and three as proven carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues, which may affect the endocrine system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an interim meal for the study, six traces of chemical substances, including one in France banned fungicide.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including in the lunch where the traces of a study in the EU Insektizids strictly banned.
In addition, the Hacksteak, the tuna from Pandora, the Baguette and chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals.
The tap water have brought the analyses the presence of nitrates and Chloroform to light.
Dinner was the salmon steak with 34 identified chemical residues, the "richest", and even for putting the meal in the microwave used plastic plate was not free.
The schlußendliche risk this pollutant "cocktails" for consumers "will probably undervalued ," according to the study.
"The Alliance Europe Ecologie Les Verts" EE (LV) has, for its part, "given the urgency of the situation," proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, "the increase in diseases of civilisation".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for the presence of residues of 365 different, in fruit and vegetables identified identified pesticides, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
