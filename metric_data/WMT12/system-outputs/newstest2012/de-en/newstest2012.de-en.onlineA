No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by the Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused the request to abolish those clauses in the context of a revision of the Penal Code on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced.
The members of Parliament at the second reading of the application to mitigate the punishments for economic fraud rejected the new rules which would have can pave the way for the liberation of the imprisoned ex-Prime Minister.
Timoshenko had been sentenced to seven years in prison in October due to the conclusion of a supposedly negative contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, the appeal of the condemned in court should be negotiated in December.
Timoshenko itself referred to the ruling as political revenge of the regime and also in the West of the process was the suspicion of bias of the Court.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365, the former Prime Minister was convicted on the basis, of the Penal Code was supported by 147 members.
226 Votes would have been necessary to its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of Libyan liberation or Libyan rebellion has already their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert, and without him the war is over.
Now, only the winners are to define.
As usual, win him this region in the elections of Islamists, the question is which - the moderate or the radical only.
The National Transitional Council known to the common law of the Scharīʿa from which you now have some idea when God.
Libya would the country without crime, because for stealing one hacks in short from the hand.
Women should forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, any religious apostasy will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the company themselves will in future United mutually feuding tribes of the Qur'an.
In short – in Libya an order that would be in this country hardly imaginable and in particular hardly desirable will prevail.
Only - our lifestyle is now times not the only and objectively probably also not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans variety.
Viewed it rather surprising, is that the Muslim fighters at all of the infidel dogs help left.
To their apology, probably only the fact may serve the air strikes of NATO not by any General from America, but from Allah himself were taken, whose Allmacht was praised after each successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not include.
We took part only in a shootout, served the interests of Islam and our politicians from in the person of the dictator of a political allies without having this brought any advantage.
The fresh and bad experiences of Afghanistan and the Iraq we saw rather from a military occupation of Libya.
Thus the natives are the expulsion of the Crusaders a concern RID - namely.
Get the oil companies but also without occupation of the black gold to the dirt cheap?
Hardly and so the West can boast once rightly his selflessness in terms of protection of human rights.
If the representatives of Scharīʿa not this ruin them.

Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech the Czech selection will mix with so next year at the European Championships, it is also gratifying that a premium amounting to about 200 million flows to local football.
From the first minutes on fairly militant football was played.
Both teams combined lengthy and so was played mainly around the center line.
Also in the second half the pressure of the home team remained, the wide reductions before the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.

The menu of an obese child: It not breakfast and eat sausage for dinner
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children are overweight.
Current polls proved to be - obese children come mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
Demonstrates once again the environment is as important for the healthy development of a person, in which he grows up and the examples are surrounding him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more frequently on the table, as in families in which normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had French fries for dinner the day before while under the motto "Obesity is no accident".
In families with fatties also sports not just to the hobbies, what concerns but also the majority of today's students - replied only 15 per cent, is one that is her parents find least once in a week time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, while nearly 900 children from primary schools in the Czech Republic were interviewed.
This was already the second year of the action "Obesity is no accident", which is supported by the general health insurance company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th took part in the project classes.
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors which are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of children with obesity or even obesity.
"Only half of the interviewed children stated for example, five times a day, in the mode to eat - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet breakfast second breakfast lunch Vesper dinner", is one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as important are the regular breakfast time in the family, for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, but only 23 percent of the families of the students have breakfast.
And in most families, each on its own breakfast.
The finding was the worst that ever is not breakfast in every tenth family.
The breakfast is as a cornerstone of healthy daily diet.
The survey test brought among other things on the day that you consumed more often unhealthy French fries in the families of overweight children.
And almost everyone - regardless of the weight - drink sweet soft drinks (70 percent) every day
Although more than 40 percent of surveyed children play sports, but only less than half of their parents do that - only 15 percent.
Make up your own menu you
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) from facilities offered to appetite and opinion to assemble their own diet.
"What prefer Czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition, is far from the ideal of a healthy diet."
There were many pastries, meat dishes and of course sweets among their favorite foods.
"Above all the large popularity of sweet soft drinks is alarming," stresses in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, so the main course, pasta just before poultry won.
Pulses almost not at all liked children and also the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunch was very low.
Come out to the health
The survey also showed at the same time that the children are quite prepared to change their eating habits, if they get the correct information.
It is listed in the results of the project "In the control group of the Umfragebeteiligten completed the questionnaire after the informative lecture"Obesity is no accident", was to have a significant shift in the preferences to principles of healthy nutrition in many cases".
This was obvious, for example, when the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children crossed in the questionnaire also more often chicken or fish as the main course of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet dishes.
Professionals claim – a stylist must be also a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists, I had bitching a bit that was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
Since I felt what still is not at all.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar about how that works "on the square".
It will be even worse.
Depending on the test moves closer, more information and practical tasks us ahead.
But even if the course Saturday and Sunday takes place each, he is still full.
This time we debated how it attracts a woman, who has not a perfectly proportioned figure with Director Alena (no one man takes part in the course).
And most of us are all the same.
Some have a short neck, the other a to boyish figure without proper curves, and still others are chubby.
It is visually to disguise thing of stylists, wide shoulders, to extend the neck, or to conjure up the necessary curves.
We got also tips on how you so cute and figurbetont attracts the type of a woman like Jennifer Lopez - with large breasts, wide hips and narrow waist, without that it acts too provocatively.
If for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really doesn't fit, should be made-to-measure tailor themselves at least a piece.
You will not regret it safely, because well fitting clothes is simply priceless.
In such a tailored skirt you'll feel much better than in a out of the box, all the time high and slide, standing off in the waist, etc.
In turn, boyish figures can allow to wear with wrinkles, Bauschen, applications, embroidery, or gathering.
For this information and figure types, I am glad that a whole week I time, thoroughly through your head all me to let go.
And still, I am afraid that it is almost not to create given the on homework.
Each of the participants got assigned to a celebrity namely, for which it matching outfits should - think from day wear and evening gown.
We should consider the current look, the fashion style of the corresponding star and whose character type.
I want to Miranda Kerr "attract" might know Victoria's secret from the campaign.
Inside I Exult, because for me personally, this is much better than to attract such as Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has increased probably to the hundred pounds in recent times (okay, that's a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez.
The garments should we from magazines cut or search in the Internet, print and then graphically edit.
Is in the "mood Board", as the entire result is called, our personal style and our relationship to be then graphic design to express.
It is indeed very important to reflect also on the graphical side of stylings.
The stylist attracts models namely not only purely physically, but designed the so-called product page in the journals (according to concrete specifications, such as the trend handbags, coats, etc.).
It told us the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But that only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday lecture filled with details of figure types was flavored three visitors from the industry:
by the stylists Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and this should be capable of a stylist, to exploit this.
And a skilled stylist can do with a single article in a very different way to work.
The magic word is variability.
So you can wear as usual for example a trench coat over jeans, so like a shirt or coat, you can wear it but also on the naked body, to attract sales shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and just the whole look looks very different.
He stressed "Plays it,".
Most came but I located the following Council: "First you must know perfectly the rules."
"Only then you may break it, Jakub said.
Finally is me why we need to bone up on all these dogmas, what can be combined with which clear and why, even if you will see often quite different in Modejournalen.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing options, as he eventually photographed.
So you must be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (say ten outfits) it to style at least fifteen.
And also, that the clothing in the photo in combination with further accessories sometimes look very different from, as in reality.
So, with all this, you can expect in the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes half of the success of make up, this was confirmed by us also Jan Pokorný.
Since you need Madonna only once, to see a not just a brilliant singer, from the image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic it is facing the services of stylists rather reserved.
Also notable people deem it frequently throwing out money (the main thing is that I bring something, how I look it is secondary).
And if somebody of us style, then we should expect that he or she imposes a different (smaller) size us most likely, than he or she needs in fact.
Then you then just have to Google to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes the corresponding celebrity have to again or taken off, needs, etc.
Jan and Mario laid us on Sunday to the heart, not to believe that a stylist on fashion to focus and then "to assemble the outfit" need.
In his work he must communicate primarily with the people which he styles and he must be a clever psychologist.
People estimate, without to delivering to and stand to his opinion.
"If any Manager ordered us to sift through their wardrobe and to supplement beautiful pieces, then we can eliminate it not the whole closet and say - my God, this is so terrible."
"You need to find at least a few commendable things, which it recommends what you can wear", says Mario.
He showed us also concretely what must include as a so-called "space bag".
So a bag you to buttons at the waist and where to wear all required Proprietäten to himself.
Except such clear things, like scissors, dispenser to the hair removal or safety pins it contains also such utensils such as a nylon thread (so that the stylist for photographing of products such as handbags or hats helps out), special clips which back the clothes is killed, if it is too large (pins or other terminals are prohibited, so that the fabric is not broken) and of course sewing kit.
So that we must not only listen to, but also practically can try something, we learned how to properly under sticks shoes.
Also when shooting in the Studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the sole of the shoe, let the outside.
Us o stuck and we stuck...
With scissors, you may not even touch the shoes for you Yes not damaged.
So, you must proceed really sent.
Mario delighted me by he praised my "creation" without any restrictions.
The mentioned skills is namely not just my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we at got to listen to the second weekend continuation rate.
One has become now clear to me - is the styling on a professional level to dedicate a no brainer.
V need for speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree journey is through a series of completely avoidable, this error to the routine trip to the early shift.
Though, managed to fulfil the ambitions for the most part, but what good is that if obviously nobody had desire to do a bit more.
Even before he came on the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
Promised he but the already elderly game series "need for speed" again a piece in a new dimension to move and the playable demonstration examples, he seemed to actually be not only one of the many action racing games.
We were also curious as fail the fitted passages, in which the main protagonist of the car rises and continues walking.
But as it is already used for NFS, much is different in the end than had been expected.
There are certain – potentially pretty decent Arcade Racing, but overall the game is diminished by some unnecessary errors more or less a few years are present in this series.
So there are signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developer actually no errors more, but rather.
The adventure starts very well.
First one is introduced in the story, whose Hauptfigur Jack has certain problems of personal nature; the only solution seems to be an illegal race across America to take part in.
In San Francisco, so on the West Coast, one sits down at the steering wheel - whose mission is to be the first in New York City.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting items.
The entire route is divided in 10 stages and more than fifty individual race.
This means that every race on the other line is held, and that the individual stages in different, sufficiently different and interesting environment take place.
One gets the impression that game would no moment again and again the same offer.
Some environments are still very pretty to look at, although the technical level of the graphic does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing earth-shattering.
But the journey through the desert, by autumnal landscape or high above snow-covered landscape gives visually very pleasant you a feeling.
Occasionally non-standard elements bring a little variety in the individual race.
In the desert such as the, one is surprised by a desert storm which heavily restricts the view.
In the mountains in turn you have to watch hellish, it is buried by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are fitted quite well in a row.
Only a few, but they range.
A while attempting to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (basically a classic race), then one has time to catch up (Classic race against the stopwatch), then still a personal duel with a single counterparty expected one.
And to even the police intervene, which screw will up the whole thing one.
Passages, where Jack leaves the car are a novelty.
It involves rather certain interactive animations, in which Jack flees from anyone and where the player must help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are in the game of much less such passages than one would expect (actually probably only three).
Ultimately this thing is more for the benefit, because this element has at least a chance to be boring - it is promised to the elements which make the game interesting in the context of the above.
The driving model continues in the footsteps of the previous parts.
In other words, seen from today's point of view, it rips off although no trees, on the other hand it could be said that it would be bad.
Those looking for realistic simulations, must look elsewhere.
But the local driving model is also still quite an action-packed racing, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then everything best is fine so far.
Real problems only appear after a certain time.
In contrast to the driving model the collision model is not quite OK
From a game of this type is hardly to be expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically before any impact with an object, any idea how the car behaves, then not everything is fine apparently.
Case in point: when you close overtaking or passing of oncoming cars "it touches" the other car in some places only slightly, but in the slings to get in another, almost identical situation and turns wild pirouettes.
Or just drives the cart to scrap.
Thanks of the restart system makes that although nothing further, as it is always annoying.
The remaining images are so solved: If one has total loss or lands far away from the track, then the game throws one back at the last clue of the route.
Only - in every race there are only five remaining art.
If one has exhausted it, everything from scratch to go...
The remaining images are so rather something like a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but it leave you not should be preferred.
Sometimes helps but not even the restart, since nothing else helps to learn as the critical section of the head.
It is very uncomfortable that the same things often happen in the same places.
You must go through some curves for example in very specific ways, otherwise you pay not by.
Elsewhere you meet at the appropriate place of "civilian" cars always in same configuration, no matter, whether as first or fifth, formerly of five seconds or a minute later comes.
This is annoying especially in situations when one sees that the counterparty a playing passes to two oncoming cars, but until you go there yourself, the cars are already in such a position, that one must they drive around or brakes.
And it is no matter when there arrives, everything is so designed that there always densely is this situation in your face.
The opponents have other advantages.
There are a few places where it is being over always in the same place by the same opponent in the whole game and again regardless of the time.
This is the roughest on the conclusion of the game on the long bridge that it happens in the opposite direction.
The counterparty must one here obviously to Devil come out to overtake.
And if it is then ever before, then he takes the view a course, so that there initially a few times in Equinovarus driving your car.
Clear - it wants to make the game simply thrilling and exciting but this intention is so clearly that they quickly vermiest the joy of playing one.
And that is a pity, because despite the simpler model of driving, the game is overall quite entertaining and at times so action loaded that we hardly know where the head is a.
And, in principle, no matter what the concept with fifty unique routes "blame" - is the arrangement of the race in a way that no boredom can arise, or something else entirely...
An unusual idea is also change of cars during the race.
You should not overlooked the gas stations on the line, because here you can change the car, although in most cases the car enough, that one just has.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports car are well suited to the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and Super exotic sports cars for the technical journeys, for example on the winding in the mountains.
Also the tasks mode (challenges) - so the race in the individual locations familiar from the history goes hand in hand with the mode of the game story.
Here, there are not only medals but also experience points for the own profile to win that is common for the tasks (challenges), and the story.
To get to the higher level of the driver, various objects need to be closed: starting from the car, and the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected to the online function AutoLog that compares with other players including the own results and also provides other collective functions.
One of the more obscure carvers is a situation in the last race of the history.
Here you go namely by car in an underground tunnel (all right), where long locking you in the dark on the tracks (all right).
Look at the speedometer digits between 150 a 200 km/h (all right), but then comes suddenly from behind a rapid and uncompromising driving a wreck.
In our editorial staff, we will argue probably long about whether that was a blackout of the Spielgestalter or whether the authors deem us as stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there even brilliant.
Even more annoying is that when some exciting moments the refresh rate is slower and sometimes quite dramatically.
This applies however, namely the accidents with larger number of involved, where a continuous FPS anyway does not help one.
The sound is so far OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to attract an as wide as possible scale rather young audience, was a soundtrack of a Lá "of each something"-but who buys himself such a game yet because the music?
The overall impression of need for speed: the run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game would diminished by the mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we had can claim with the shrug of the belief that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But as the game looks somehow unfinished.
For which a class treat, but you should prepared be, that these errors stand one with the power of airport lights in the eyes.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation of Negativisten and Euro-sceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty brought tangible the balance among the different institutions from the lot."
"I would not expect that such a tough war rages."
"It will take five, six years until troubled waters smoothed itself and will have all become accustomed to their new role", began her talk at the Law Faculty of Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply.
How she Verständlich and openly takes seriously the motto "on Europe", showed already in the first part of her lecture in which it managed to describe that as lecturer of the Law Faculty of the Charles University would have can below them about the individual bodies of the EU and their mutual relationships in a such manageable and understandable way.
Mrs Vicenová commended also the new permanent President of the European Council Herman van Rompuy:
"Initially was loud, he is too unobtrusive - grey officials who was not up to such a role, but I have to say, it has all the breath devious how well he has taken the matter."
"He is a man, which it completed will patiently listen to twenty-seven Member States, to communicate with them and has above all a clear idea of how to proceed with the EU."
The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and security policy said they then as an answer to the question: who is this actually - the European Union? What number should I call? ", as a major step to the unification and better readability of the EU countries, such as China or India."
No one wants to ban us our Ölmützer cheese
Mrs Vicenová devoted himself to the agenda, according to which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago, she called success.
The Czechs had overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also the Summit of Eastern Partnership organized.
The fall of the Government during the Presidency, she called big negative point that have severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech delegation in the EU has to do all hands full.
With the words of the Ambassador told it went to quite hectic not just the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis which has still not been overcome until today.
And since even the seven year budget of the EU must be approved, what makes much more complicated the matter precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether it is a sleek and economical budget which sectors of the economy get priority, which more countries and which less - promoted all of this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls their own slogans, with whom she came to Brussels: "Verständlich over Europe".
"If I don't like something, then there are greyish abbreviations, foreign words and jargon, which nobody understands."
How do I actually know as citizens whether one thinks out really curved or round cucumbers and different sized bananas in Brussels, or whether in fact someone wants to ban the cheese us.
It would also like to used the floor of the EU to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in Vista
According to the EU Ambassador, the Czechs in reputed to be more Eurosceptic are the negative than perceive the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
Many factors are responsible, including the retention of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
Besides the successful Czech presidency, she pointed out the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called v4.
"Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian comes to me and is a Slovak close, then thinks the Frenchman next to me:"Hey, what's her since the heads together - this is your v4 again?"and it makes a pretty sour face."
Mrs Vicenové according to especially hard rules for the budget policy of Member States expect the EU in the future.
It looks at the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds as much real as a "European Federation".
"We have the euro-zone countries and the countries outside the euro zone."
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of reinforced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries you want to work, who want it and those who do not want it to be quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately amounts to a strong"Europe of different speeds"," expect woman Vicenová.
In this regard she acknowledged also the role the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle according to which all issues which affect the whole of the EU from all Member States must be discussed, and not only by the countries of the euro area.
Brand story:
The innovator IBM enters into the second century of its existence
Wanted to you looking for a suitable word, that the strategy of IBM most accurately characterized, then this would be the word "Longevity" probably.
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, known as a modern company, although already a century has elapsed since its inception.
Already their first chef - the visionary Thomas j. Watson sen laid the Foundation to this longevity.
Already he was the slogan that numerous global problems could be easily solved if people would be willing to think a bit.
His slogan "Think!" was to a trademark, the life of the future giant should take place (and at the same time the title of the in-house magazine to publish began at IBM already in 1935).
This was also the basis of the corporate culture that is thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle move to the future."
IBM survived and was successful because it has stayed true to its principles and was not afraid to change anything else round about also a whole century.
That allowed us, in the course of our first century, the technologies to transform business and society.
"We hope that we create even more in the next hundred years", said Samuel j. Palmisano, the current Director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Sophisticated system
Watson operation already in the 1930s social care of his employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Bata in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had as one of the first American workers paid leave, insurance by the contractor plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and an ingenious system of remuneration for the best innovators and dealers.
Long-term relations of IBM are just as sophisticated with their customers.
The company was from the beginning, awesome in the talent - as one of the first companies worldwide IBM picked up any discrimination - and could choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the top of IBM alternated next year by a woman from Virginia Rometty.
Which is already 30 years at IBM, so far she took up the position of sales, marketing and strategy manager.
IBM makes adult's so-called online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - ideas there enough, almost half a million people is employed in the company.
An institution with good reputation
Its unshakable position in the business the company guarantees a strong image and this towards the inside and to the outside.
"The concept of an institution, as a mere technology company from the outset had IBM rather", Economist said the Professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems by using of technologies", George colony added to by consulting firm Forrester research.
As the company itself emphasised, is there a difference on the market to be only present or to shape him directly by this presence.
IBM - in the States of their logos due to familial "big blue", in a century has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting, and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
From all us technology companies, IBM has the most patents and already five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Prize.
Among his most famous inventions such as ATMs, credit cards, Finanzswap, bar code, or also the disk.
With approximately $220 billion market capitalization (market capitalization) IBM this year was the second-largest technology company (immediately after Apple), which it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The view ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers – unhappy were for example the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online service prodigy or the computer IBM PC Jr.
"Business is based on the forward motion, so you must bind itself not emotionally to the past," said Samuel j. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem to build its foundations on various platforms - and to leave them if they don't work, again.
In contrast to rival Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system stands or falls.
Promising technologies
The profits from IBM services participate to a great extent, software and hardware to participate to each one-fifth.
It was still 1990 most represented hardware containing more than fifty prozentigem.
Since 2000, IBM sold theirs off little gain in assets valued at $15 billion, at the same time, however, it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-oriented technologies.
In these investments, IBM will continue after 2008 as swept the modern financial crisis for the first time like a storm across the world.
Also IBM remained the legacy of his first Chief Thomas j. Watson, increased the amount of its investment in the middle of the great depression.
So far, it seems that the company IBM without prejudice to survive today's crisis.
The value of IBM shares rose like a rocket since 2008 by 120 percent and net income of the company grows kontinuell.
The customers of IBM is: everything can change - only the values do not.
Also, it can be expected that this flexible giant masters the next crisis.
IBM history: from the cheese cutter to space flights
Initially, the company IBM (international business machines) founded one hundred years ago in New York had a rather complicated name - computing Tabulating recording Corporation.
She assumed the name of IBM until 1924 – originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The merger of four companies, whose history dating back to the eighties of the nineteenth century laid the Foundation for the later company IBM.
They had technologies such as for example the famous Stechkarte clocks to register the start and corresponding.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, which held until 1930 also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
And it was Flint, who was the head of the rival firm Thomas j. Watson, so that this helped him in the direction of the company.
This leader then even the founders of IBM in the shadows - on Watson's ideas was based until today the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, began, as the name reveals, the production and the distribution of all possible machines for trading - sausage and cheese cutters up to cash registers.
He doubled their sales to nine million dollars in the first four decades, in which Watson led the company, and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company whole forty years sitting in the Executive Chair, until he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop of artificial intelligence to work and developed also the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computer from IBM NASA helped to direct flights into space - the mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of people to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with same computer architecture - the series of IBM System/360 in 1964.
A classic PC, which determined the computer standard of at the time, came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its PC production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand however bought the Consul tante part of the PricewaterhouseCoopers company and entered the hereby fully in the business consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that pays off IBM in the past three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It is the intention to use technologies in a clever way in so far not even planned areas, also to improve the situation in the transport sector and in the city administration.
In the trade sector IBM introduced recently the platform "Smarter Commerce", is designed to help dealers manage the commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932, IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia - ever first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM operates Czech Republic, including a strategic outsourcing Centre in Brno.
Moved the Head Office for Central and Eastern Europe in Prague and also a top team of world-class, located here that deals with the technology of voice recognition.

You can keep you iveta - this ass, I no longer want him!
Says Darina Rychtářová (53) - now it's!

But now it is final with patience over and she has set out clear rules for more life.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
Darina Rychtářová of singer I Bartošová had offered refuge in their own home, her would be invaded probably not even in a dream, as this goes out with her husband.
Iveta back off and back moved at the urging of her out after 30 days Říčany, Josef went with equal.
Yes, it publicly known that he loves them.
Over time, Darina resigned, yes it even seemed as if she wants reconciled again with her unfaithful husband - but now she gave him definitively the governement.
Rychytář it does not matter, with whom his wife sleeps
Rychtář iveta Bartošová should but leave in the future, he will be received at home not sure open arms.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to choose his days in our common home, then I will not drive him."

The worst female Untugenden: What is's with you?
If one asks the men to to call some typical female Untugenden, then they shake some invariably prompt from the sleeve.
Dear women, recognize you are in the following lines, where we review a few were let through again, that the blood in the veins undulate allow men?
Shopping addiction
Accuses her husband them to be addicted to shopping?
Need to buy yourself a week at least a Hader?
Go like shopping and it may be just a bit more action?
It is in your case probably really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware and reasonably try their shopping desire under control to keep.
But hand on heart, which woman holding out there already, looking to stroll after a well-fitting outerwear only by a clothing store and not just to try out all (in all possible colour combinations) in the cabin?
Even when shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is pure hell often.
Consider how often they said her husband doch mal - stay times rather out there...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too thick?"
'I would have to diminish at least five kilo, should I start to jog or to make gymnastics?'
"You at all like I?"
It is found that somehow known them?
Yes?
Then you probably also belong to the women who are thorough owned them, what they look like.
That long does not mean that you go to can, but many men are allergic react if their wife constantly whines about her appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints, the women are always more.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Window cleaning, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and this at least twice in the week.
Rant with her partner, because he once again trampling with dirty shoes on the clean floor tiles, you scold the children because the just frayed sink is dirty again, and the glass door to the living room Cabinet again has fingerprints, where polishing but makes so much effort?
Should suffer this kind of "Deviance", then you should know that you may exaggerate nothing and that order and cleanliness in family life in the first place.
This excessive purity alternatively can harm ultimately also the mutual relations and above all tranquility in the family.
Jive
"Dirty collarless come in the laundry basket."
"Do you attract really tomorrow again the old socks?"
"You cannot simply throws a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a rant, you may not be surprised, that this brings him on the Palm.
Clearly, this is not bad meant, they just want that everything has its order.
If the men knew this women needed may be not so much to gripe.
Gossip
Some women gossip and gossip like, as is getuschelt behind the back or even slander or it forges alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, therefore it heck through such issues like for example - who, where, who, how and why.
Probably each of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip on Commons.
Hand on heart - that is inherent to all women.
This is however not to be confused with Klatschtanten of grossest caliber, where nothing and no one is holy, which probably despise anyone in their environment, and which pose a significant risk for women collectives.
Jagr and Voracek helped Philadelphia with their assistances to victory
The NHL right winger Jaromir Jagr had the Monday game of the National Hockey League with two assistantships large proportion of 5: 3-victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and this is again productive Czech players in the NHL.
Beneficiaries of the overview of neununddreißigjährigen ice hockey star was both Claude Giroux, which added still an Assistant and was proclaimed to be the best player of the match.
Even Jagr's teammates Jakub Voracek had two assistantships in the same game.
Jagr claimed after the game journalists, he did Giroux a great evening prophesied.
"Before the match I tells him that today a Hattrick succeeds."
"I had that somehow the feeling."
"Every now and then such a feeling comes over one", said Jagr, whose action Giroux at the first shot the flyers scored one goal.
A bit later, also the second hit "a Czech track" had.
Voracek won the puck behind the hurricanes and presented him to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
One second before the final whistle of the first third of the home players Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second third belonged to the flyers again.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with Jagr, he scored his third goal, after Wayne Simmonds drew shot to the fourth gate.
"I love it, to play with him."
"I will not say that he is the best player in the League, but certainly he is three among the best," Jagr paid tribute to its Center.
"I would not invaded in life, that I play at the end of my career with such a hockey player together, like with him."
"Glad huge."
"I cut with my game on I."
"All those years in the National Hockey League, my teammates set their game on me and now the Pike turns around," Jagr smiled.
Carolina made game still on a play - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who came from a penalty shot, it came up on a goal.
Matt read prevented but any further complication, in which he was successful in power play two against one.
"Excellent Pronger acted in our zone."
"He had the puck, I took up ride and (read) moved to more distant post."
"I tried to meet him and am glad that it worked," Voracek described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
By this victory, Philadelphia sat down at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech Defender Montreal Jaroslav Špaček, injured in a game against Buffalo, and retired in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens lost along with their experienced Beck also their leadership a unverloren in penalty shooting 2: 3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not transform one of penalty shots.
More than the lost points, high disease-related failure on the defensive ached probably the coach of the home team - they played the game with only five does to an end.
"That's bad."
"We played only with a single experienced player to end the encounter, the rest were young players."
"But because nothing can make, which we need to be ready," said Jacques Martin.
"With each change a wave after the other and we had nothing to counter the."
"We could make the game easier and the puck from our third take out need to."
"Here there was still", said p. k. Subban, one of the defensive player.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec repelled thirty shots of Tampa Bay and contributed so significantly to a 5-2-in victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats hereby, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were ČSSR only five authorized State agencies in the former: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies sold mainly only travel in the Socialist bloc countries, were at that time only select in the West.
And so travelled Czech tourists on the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - East Germany), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea, and after Hungary at the Lake Balaton.
A clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to the former Yugoslavia, then, Yugoslavia set a pro-Western course and therefore trips were limited to the former Yugoslavia.
A great paradox of those Socialist times was that it was not even allowed citizens of the Eastern bloc (including the Czechs), to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If a citizen of CZECHOSLOVAKIA wanted travel for example individually to Poland or even in the Soviet Union then he needed to a so-called letter of invitation, otherwise individuals were not possible.
Already at that time, the travel agencies offered also travel to the West, then had to you but huge snakes in buying take stay also in the sleeping bag before the travel agency, or have at least "good friends" in the travel agency.
So the thing had not been still long.
The so-called foreign exchange approval - the condition for a departure to the West - has been granted only "politically reliable" people – the others were allowed to travel do not.
The Czechoslovak currency was namely not freely exchangeable currency, without foreign currency commitment it would have been impossible, to raise the necessary funds (Western currency) for a journey to the West.
The Afar most Czechs spent therefore their holidays at home, no wonder that the Czechs countless pavilions and cottages bought - a habit that continues to this day.
A travel revolution of the Czechs followed the Velvet Revolution of 1989 on the foot.
While until 1989, a holiday in East Germany or in Bulgaria were the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries of around the world last year.
An enormous paradox, there is today no longer aware, is the fact that you ever not could travel Croatia in the most popular holiday destination of the Czechs - until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of 90's of the last century the foreign exchange requirement in the neighbouring West European countries was lifted, causing a massive wave of short visits to Vienna, in particular Austria and Germany.
The Czechs could have simply not enough long time of their travels to the West, everyone wanted to have been at least a couple of days there.
So, the Czech tourists when travelling to Paris slept in a tent in the Park, because who would have had at that time already the money for a stay in the hotel or in a boarding house.
A typical feature of travelling by Czechs was a trunk packed full with canned food, beer and summer sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of freely exchangeable CZK - after decades of our tourists could buy finally free the Western currency.
Our standard of living and thereby also the average salaries increased to, which in 1997 resulted in a more important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel after 1997, the travel agencies began regularly by Charter flights to prepare journeys, which incredibly prices plunged the airline travel thanks to the possibility to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past.
The Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payment transactions with all advanced countries of the world, had the late of 1990s which made the trip even easier.
A further interesting moment in the history of "post Velvet" travel occurred in 2000, when thanks to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - was placed under Thailand.
Since then every year direct Charter aircraft fly with Czech passengers to distant sunny countries; This year, it flies to 12 exotic destinations directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 thousand. Czech travel annually to exotic countries!
A further significant moment in the era that featured our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the visa requirements for Czech tourists picked up the United States, which our country definitely filed a under the advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history it issued more than 15 thousand. CZK per head for a single stay including the costs at the resort.
The annual general meeting is to find a new Chairman – again threatens a stalemate.
Almost five months of Czech football has no Chairman and thereby threatens that Ivan Hašek successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) not even will be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
Until today are according it the electoral code should be dialed: still no agreement.
And without this, at all, no vote on the three potential successors is possible.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek retired from his position, where he called on his colleagues at the departure to had to agree and to find a strong personality that could guide the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hasek the old quarrels between the two chambers of the Federation broke out again, which themselves cannot agree on a joint candidate.
This was clearly on 16 September, when the new Chairman should be selected.
The delegates of the annual general meeting had come completely free in the Volkshaus in the Prague quarter Smichov, because negotiation led to no result, and was not only to the election itself.
One could indeed not even about agree, who is actually entitled to vote at the full collection - only the statutory representatives or officials equipped with a power of attorney.
On this single point, it reached at least some agreement, which contributed also the recommendation of the Institute of State and law, whose opinion a representation on a proxy basis is not permissible.
The disputes over the electoral code take to still.
The Executive Committee also brought no more clarity on the matter at its meetings – regardless of whether ordinary or extraordinary - in nothing else more on the agenda is the principle at all.
Although the views on the choice changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: what should we do round in the 3rd, to avoid a stalemate?
"The point of contention concerns the question of whether one should proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether a completely different model needs to be found," Dušan Svoboda, said that one of the three Deputy Chairmen of FAČR representing the professional football management.
According to its registered model, those candidate who receives the larger percentage support in the Chamber for the Perben WINS in the third round.
Moravia is reportedly ready to respond to the compromise that WINS those candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both houses.
The Czech side in turn is on the condition that the winner of this percentage counting receives at least two-thirds.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no sense whatsoever, this mode would make the entire dual-Chamber concept into question," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, that it would be best not to turn to the electoral code, but to choose according to valid Statute.
Surprisingly also Tomáš Paclík agrees, even if emerging that the statutory electoral code of all candidates will most probably Pelta contrary to.
"My wish is, that as far as possible is selected according to the articles of Association."
"So that no unreasonable spare variants are thought of as at the last annual general meeting", explained the owner (of football) Victoria Plzeň, who stood for the first time and in his opinions, especially Pelta to delimited himself.
Pelta remains but optimistic.
In his opinion the new Chairman will be in Nymburk known and he believes that the candidate in the future will also constructively work together.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the euro today would help ensure calm the minds."
"If the football only riding on the euphoric wave, then also the willingness to cooperate is greater," says the official from Jablonec, which brings the greatest experience of all three adepts and this professional, as well as regional level.
Rajchl is as restrained.
"I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts"to turn their way the rules for his own purposes"."
"Therefore, a renewed blockage at the annual general meeting is not excluded."
"However, I hope that the common sense WINS eventually", said Rajchl.
Only - plenty of time to agreement all sides will remain no longer.
Some negotiations should play is supposedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the generality of football will be completely up to the qualifier at all.
The Charter plane which, among other things, Dalibor-Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not start due to a technical malfunction in the morning in Prague and so it sought feverishly for a replacement version, how to bring a part of the Executive Committee yet on the venue of the barrage Hinspiels.
Finally the meeting at ministerial level is crucial then surely, which supposedly is to occur on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, which would have been Minister for education, youth and physical training like an agreement moves the divided parties within the largest Sportverbands in the country.
There is much at stake: State benefits, the trust value of Czech football, and also the upcoming AGM of ČSTV, that is to have the new direction the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into battle to the position of Chairman, because he sees no suitable candidates
When Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner football players before the extraordinary general meeting could have made out a strong candidate, which would have fulfilled all of his wishes on the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would have admitted is at all not on the battle for this leading position.
"If there were a good candidate, then I would for him fight and forego the choice."
"But in the current situation, was unable to find a such adepts", Paclík, CTK said.
The main reason for Paclík, to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is it so to avoid that which reaches supposed favorites of choice, Pelta, to the top of FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that he only one year to exercise the function of the Chairman intends in the event of his victory so until 2013, up to the date of the annual general meeting.
In the position of the Chairman he would have liked learn a top-manager, which is not too much in the football events.
"With some eligible people I've spoken personally."
"Hard to believe that me some said they wanted to identify currently not with Czech football."
"Such views would have gladly changed", he stated.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disturbs the connection of Pelta's with the Chairman of the Pilsen District Football Association Roman jumpers, a man with a controversial reputation, which is behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegates votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, it is unacceptable that Pelta had held the position of Chairman for this reason.
"In his victory would the State of today's single konserviert and Czech football it not go ahead at all."
"The support of jumpers, one would get excellent businessman, football double bad", stressed Paclík.
Hereby he plays on also that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone taps to determine in a Korruptionsaffaire, but punishment emerged from the Pelta.
"I a victory of Pelta don't know (Czech) which prestige which" "Football should introduce."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA" řekl Paclík said his "he will sell the Pilsner Football Club earlier saying, when will Pelta of Chairman", but already somewhat relaxed looks.
Should Paclík in the Thursday election win, he could imagine but quite a future cooperation with Pelta.
Just think an another candidate - Rajchl, the Paclík had supported before the general meeting in October ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go."
"He has great ability".
"I could imagine him well as head of the national team."
"But I don't think that he is able to lead the Association as a Manager."
"I stick my nose but not in matters of which I don't understand anything", said Paclík, which thus had caused September stir, that he was behind the removal of the referee Commission with Luďěk Macela at the top, replacing the Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík even claims that he feels has grown the role of Verbandsvorsitzenden.
And refers it to his abilities in the direction of private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, which with its support in May the first victory in the League celebrated.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain culture of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeals commissions, what degenerate until in sickening situations", noted Paclík who makes no secret of his antipathy for example opposite the Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský.
As one of its priorities, he would see to the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, which he lobbyieren would the political leaders for this, that more money from the lottery tax in the sport.
"That is one of the crucial things the new President should address".
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their reasoning, then they must say but also quite and clearly where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsen Club looks at also Paclík not as a handicap, even though he himself stressed the Chairman of FAČR must be "nonpartisan".
Pelta in turn is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Dukla Prague.
"This is not exactly ideal."
"It but also doesn't make much sense, Club hypocritically on a third party to transfer my shares in the Pilsner to return after one and a half years my opinion", Paclík made it clear.
Pelta promised new rules of FAČR, which will exclude a stalemate.
Two days before the annual general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Chairman of the Board, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised he will strongly become in case his choice for this, that the FAČR gets new statutes exclude disputes over the election rules from the outset in the future.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiating in Nymburk and believes the election will defuse safely on a possible success in the Czech selection.
Pelta promised already before the unrealised election in September, he would focus on the national team and the acquisition of financial resources in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last minute, to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so the two month pause liked help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and to present in a broader context.
"People at all levels focus on the football, they are impatient and expect therefore that the Chairman is known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time, that the Association is led by someone, says the man who Club is connected above all with the Jablonec, but also many years at Sparta, and the Executive Committee acted."
Also, he thinks that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria is responsible for today's problems with the election, who ruled at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately statutes were approved at the annual general meeting in June, which were not so perfect, as all had accepted it."
"If they would have allowed different interpretations, we would have had already a Chairman from September", said Pelta.
He used just the revision of the main document of the civic association as Attractants for the delegates.
"Should I become President, then I suppose this personally to me and am ready to bear responsibility if it doesn't work out personally."
"This is a fundamental thing, without which it can not be," said Pelta.
In addition, he is not trying to differentiate itself compared to his counterpart.
He had earlier announced he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first Deputy.
He no longer attacked also Tomáš Paclík, who in turn had no dry thread on Pelta.
"In football, he moves over a year and can already point to some success."
"His attacks were putting down however, and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That is also why many of his real character doubt now", Pelta addressed his rival who probably remains true to his Proklamierungen, he expressed in September.
In his opinion his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football of the lowest leagues up to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would try also to end all affairs - from the causa Bohemians, up towards to the halls to of the corruption scandal last year."
"Equal then I would throw me on negotiations with the private and public sectors, to ensure sufficient financial resources for the whole football", the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate CTK said two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would mean no personal cleansing.
"I would have to make me once familiar with the job content of all employees," he said where due to the long anarchy understandably nervousness prevails in the direction of Strahov.
Despite the UN time-catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming annual general meeting, he believes that the delegates go not in vain on Thursday to Nymburk.
"When really, the only contentious point should be how to choose in the third round, then we come across it."
"The football needs credibility and he recovers only, if he finally has a new leader," remains optimistic before the possibly decisive day of his official career Pelta two days.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR below it starts to work hard
If the existing Deputy Chairman, Jindřich Rajchl, at the annual general meeting should be chosen on Thursday as the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, this would despite the mood said many people in the Association.
Rajchl promises, namely, that you begin to work hard in the event of his election.
He wants to introduce the system changes and blaming the members of the Executive Committee for individual football areas.
In addition, he promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money in football, and otherwise continue working the previous Chairman Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As President I would like to dedicate me football as a whole."
"From the international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, about the national team, professional football, up to performance football for youth."
"So I will not say that I want to do everything alone", Rajchl said in a talk for CTK.
"I am a team player and would like to distribute therefore the responsibilities the Executive Committee so that each Member dedicates a certain area."
"And I will distribute hard tasks so that football in each segment with street steps of progress."
"In many would not exactly delighted because she, even now really hard to work would have to start instead of criticizing only the work of others,", he added.
Because the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered, to no longer be a candidate.
"I is known that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people behind me are not constantly throw me stick between your legs and challenge every step I make," he said why he had hesitated as an explanation.
"Many people told me but that I not should give up, because otherwise, others would do it."
"That's confidence that we must not lose," he said.
Allegedly motivated him also, to continue the work he started on Hasek.
"In two years, we have dealt with a great piece of work and I want to not just throw away that."
"Processes were launched, will probably only be implemented in a few years and I would hate to see that she stop someone", he said, and hereby expresses his concerns to, that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return themselves to the days before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic approach and that is something that does not bring Mirek Pelta."
"Especially people who would make football so that he would be only for chosen as stand behind him."
"One can not accuse probably a lot me, that I would be biased."
"I try, to be objective."
"I want football for all, and not only the elect because it then goes all," noted Rajchl.
It contradicts also the assertion that he is only a Chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people the opposite claim I really intend to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether you should divide the League not in a Czech and Moravian part, whose Gewinner then rose to the first division."
"Then it could not happen, that today only three Moravian clubs in the League play, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia", says Rajchl.
Because now the boss of the Pilsen Club Tomáš Paclík joined the battle for the function of the Chairman, Rajchl not dares to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me to its Deputy President and now recognizes that measurable results behind me are," noted Rajchl who sees the saving of umpteen million crowns to unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and negotiations over the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand he is holding it that the Association not at a single strand draws in part.
While he of Pelta says "he was initially disqualified new confidence to help Czech football," he keeps the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who have to offer something really to football.
"No one can be in question, he has done excellent work in just one year in Plzen."
"Should he be elected, then he would continue probably things, initiated by Ivan Hašek and he would obviously not basically change the staffing in the commissions."
"He would want to turn to the things not to abdicate", Rajchl says about his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Wading pool in UFO ornamental pools in Budapest: who travels through Europe, can be blue wonder experience - and rest tired legs in bubble baths after a city tour or a walk.
A book shows where wellness in the water is at its most beautiful.
When IRIS went Meder in the past one and a half years on a research tour, one could not lacking in their baggage: her bathing suit.
Backwards lying on the water, looked she highly artistically designed domes, she swam marble putti, waiting on the pool edge to them, and marveled at meticulously restored art nouveau schwimmhallen.
Liked her a bath, she recorded at once it in your notebook - along with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and presents them in her book "Bathing" published just now: people schwimmhallen in Munich, historical palaces of bathing in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She led their "journey to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe" through 13 countries: apart from Germany, Austria and the Switzerland, she attended places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, the Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each is a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-jährige is a real bathroom culture enthusiasts.
With sport, she had not much to the hat, says Meder - only in the water, that was different.
Annoying only listen that swimming fans must resign themselves with blue tiles and stench of chlorine, while joggers inhale the beguiling scent of spruce forests or happy birds in the Park can.
"I asked myself one day why swimming pools must be always so ugly", which says living Meder in Vienna.
"So I began to collect beautiful baths."
Water surface doubled architecture
So Meder was therefore as large, because all the senses are served splash in the pool and sauna essential oils - the Wellnessfaktor in bathrooms.
And if the builders have made effort, a true feast for the eyes can be swimming pools: "Instead of a floor, it has a surface of the water in bathrooms."
"You is transparent on the one hand, on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubled optical: high arches, colorful tiles, stepping stones.
The small-format illustrated book "Bathing" provides information about the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness oases on 190 pages - makes but mostly feel like a dip in the blue.
The pool collector discovered remarkable specimens Meder during their research in Hungary.
In addition to sumptuous spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing waters in a cosy cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a thermal spa, whose Becken are filled with alkali-containing water and are in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Offer spectacular views, however, many heated outdoor pools in the Switzerland and Austria: while you have the entire city in the eye of the Zurich roof swimming pool, you can look in the outdoor swimming pool in a bath in St. Anton at the Arlberg snow-covered - and: in the steam room, there is a window from which you can watch the bustle on the ski slopes.
The perhaps most unusual pool design expected bathers in Längenfeld: the Ötz Valley Aqua dome looks like a UFO gelandetes just in the Alps.
From three shells open to the top, it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötz Valley in the Sky Tower.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in any swimming pool, the smell of chlorine in the nose rose the pool collector Meder.
Many thermal baths smell after sulfur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békéscsaba stinks to be so strong it after fuel oil, it is hardly believed landed in a health spa.
The smell comes from the alkali hydrogen carbonate containing healing water that is almost black and the Schlick one sticks to the skin when you slip into the basin - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, Iris Meder in their search was also disappointed after beautiful swimming spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech bad Luhatschowitz, she found before an area blocked off.
The bathroom designed in 1902 by architect Dušan Jurkovic was closed.
As media took a look through the weathered Windows of red, white and yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw how grown weeds between the tiles.
Maturity counteracted has one, however, in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais thermal in bad Wildbad.
This bath has three stages of construction already behind him; Discover can be not only neo-Romanesque elements that originate from times of its construction in 1844, but also as a Moorish Hall in Alhambra style that was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation of 1995 the favorite pool of the pool expert IRIS Meder - and this is the Palais thermal not only because she originally come from the black forest.
"It's an achievement, to merge different styles to one so great," says Meder.
When such a Palace, the dive in the swimming pool is apparently just a minor matter.
Agri speculation
Deutsche Bank can shed light on raw material business
By Christian Teevs
Gives their business with agricultural commodities on Deutsche Bank?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the Chairman of the group will then draw consequences.
Hamburg-
For the Germans, the thing is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it according to a study not acceptable, that banks with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn speculate.
Two-thirds of respondents want even that Deutsche Bank and other credit from this business get off, because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest people.
This is the result of a Forsa poll commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that the Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges driving the prices up - and the banks therefore bear a complicity in the global problem of hunger.
The campaign of consumer protection aimed specifically against Deutsche Bank Chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley to act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were it intended to protect merchants against price fluctuations.
But now, most experts are agreed that the gambler decoupled of supply and demand, and at the expense of the poorest profits make.
Unlike the US competitors Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the accusations and said that no business is "worth to use the good name of Deutsche Bank" it.
After information from SPIEGEL ONLINE is an international working group currently reviewing the accusations from the Foodwatch report.
The test to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank - including recommendation, how so that should be handled.
End of January the head of the Bank wants to tell then what conclusions she draws.
At the end, a reduction of the commodity business could stand, or even a complete departure.
Ackermann tinkering with his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting on rising prices of food shows very dramatically how reckless banks today damage the public good."
Ackermann stand as top Bank lobbyist now especially in the obligation.
"Deutsche Bank must delete all attachments from their portfolio, in which money is used for betting on food prices", said bode.
"Regardless whether it is Mr Ackermann people suffering hunger or to the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Chairman of the group a few months would like to give a perfect picture before his his departure from Office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chairman of the Board other than planned not to the Supervisory Board will change.
With a shift away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image.
And to possible losses it needs hardly to care - so that his successor would have eventually to do.
Every second would cancel raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep up the pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users took part in the campaign of the organization.
Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November 1001 has surveyed people on Tuesday.
Just eleven percent therefore consider it legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offers equipment, bet where the food prices.
Many bank customers would draw personal conclusions when they learn that their bank is involved in such dealings: every second would cancel all systems according to the survey, where money in the commodity speculation.
43 Percent would advise against friends from one such Bank, 49 percent indicated that to think about, to terminate your account, and to switch to another institution.
21 House in Vienna
The Pavilion drawn to
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with UPS, downs and happy ending: Of Brussels in 1958 of the Austrian Expo Pavilion won prices, became the Museum in Vienna, stood empty and degenerated.
He is now reopened as an exhibition venue.
If modern post-war architecture, carried by clear forms, glass halls, courageous turns and new building materials, that are typical for the faith in technical progress, then the Austrian Pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels world fair is a true and famous example of 1958.
Schwanzers Pavilion got at that time the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its slightly and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made known the architect so that the built Austrian Pavilion at the next world's fair.
With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus Bowl-like outhouse in Munich, he became famous in 1973 finally internationally.
His Pavilion planned as a temporary exhibition had after the World Exposition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Station erected, converted and opened in 1962 is a Museum of the 20th century - it was called the "1920's House".
Suitable but was neither spatially and technically as a Museum - no walls hang the art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used as long until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new House.
Since 2001, the building stood empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the Pavilion, he is now called "21 House" and is used in the future as a Museum for contemporary art.
Dienstagabend, the Belvedere Museum, to which belongs the House, opened the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every way there.
By Agnes Husslein-Arco has the new beginning, was the 2007 new Director of the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, Ph.d. by art historian with considerable career and others in the youth as Eiskunstläufererin, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and a founding Director of the Museum of modern art was the tag Salzburg, strongly politicians and heritage protectors, she procured public funding and private sponsorships, and set the use.
Except for contemporary art the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba by the eponymous Foundation should be issued, there should be a cafe and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built to do so.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was then the ideal person for the implementation.
Not only because he had Joseph Olbrich secession in Vienna sensitively converted and extended, and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at Vienna University of technology and the Pavilion for him was a "hugely important place" where he "almost every weekend" had looked at the exhibitions.
He knew the original draft, and he knew the problems of the building lost at his transfer to Vienna and its conversion to generosity and lightness.
At the current change, there were far bigger problems: the building was "an energy spin", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, used glass-reinforced insulating glass and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Bridges steel beams are strengthened or replaced, and asbestos-filled blankets were renovated.
Two underground floors took place for the new use, a sunken light trench between home and street ensures the exposure, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building.
The original exterior doors have remained, the House is painted in the old reddish rust colour.
And the cinema is even still exactly as he was earlier.
And all under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and is cheap and liked also the historic preservation Office", says Krischanitz, and points to a bumpy floor in the basement.
Despite all constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and light.
It had been difficult with the Pavilion "which came therefore from Brussels" Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop in-the-city history".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and wants nevertheless "a real consciousness awaken".
In this case, however, the 21 House not in the wrong place, is because it has occurred a urban fluke: to the Swiss garden around is just the newly planned "station hotel", with Office and residential buildings.
And an other godsend is perhaps still enter: 21 House could get amplification of an another Krischanitz build, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought Temporäre Kunsthalle Berlin, and as we hear, she negotiated with the city a neighbourly site in the Swiss Garden.
Train planning winter anti-crisis package worth millions
The railway has studied a crises plan, which is intended to prevent cancellations in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
This costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related cancellations and delays Deutsche Bahn also emits a newspaper report that this year about 70 million euros.
The "image" newspaper reported advance, citing an internal crisis plan 2015 investments of a total of approximately 300 million euros are planned.
A better availability should achieve of vehicles and rail network in extreme downpours.
It is planned to include a doubling of internal and external staff for the removal of snow on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000 persons.
The objective is to free platforms up to the start of the operation and 90 per cent of the essential points within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago Bahn CEO Ruediger Grube had warned after a meeting of top Government and industry cancellations and delays in this winter.
Last winter, the railway passenger services had significant problems, as lacking her among other things in difficult weather conditions in reserves.
So, many new regional trains wait for years for authorisation by the federal railway Office.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train makes to create significantly more likely in the Workshop examine axes of ICE trains must allow, after an ICE Cologne main railway station had a Achsenbruch also for years.
Deutsche bank pays million penalty in the United States
New affliction from the United States comes after the turmoil to boss Josef Ackermann: Die Deutsche Bank there a fine of millions pay.
As if the problems were not enough at home for Deutsche Bank, now his past in the United States catches up with the industry giants: the Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison of 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It involves the sale of mortgage securities.
Finanzmarktregulierer NCUA accuses a number of big banks, having led the cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they have played down the risks.
Such papers lost during the financial crisis, strong value and tore the banks with in depth.
"We are pleased that we could resolve the issue, without having had to move the parties before the Court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said.
The Bank admitted no fault with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup committed to pay $ 20.5 million.
The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed concessions the two sounding.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. credit unions and jumps for bankruptcies, to protect the customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get replaced the losses of billions.
The now closed comparisons are the first of its kind.
Regulators had other big banks made above and in summer sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The questionable mortgage securities is known as mortgage-backed securities.
Home loans are based on these.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, this a wide range of financial firms was undoing.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers tipped to.
Even though the events some years back, so a sharp wind blows forward currently in the United States the banks.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits, to receive compensation or to penalize misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has raised the largest wave of litigation.
She accuses 18 large international banks to have disadvantaged the two State U.S. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage transactions with a volume of around 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also is facing a complaint of FHFA, we are talking to several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurt for "substantial losses" are just, without however mentioning an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and said to want to defend themselves.
Warren Buffett rises up with 10 billion at IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the large American Investor Warren Buffett had always declared not in it and computer companies to invest, because the long-term development of the companies poorly forecast let.
Now have however read the annual reports from IBM he changed his mind about investment in the industry.
He did need to understand much earlier that IBM offers mainly services and obtain computer systems for other companies IT departments.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered accolade in the financial world.
As a result IT veteran IBM may call themselves now "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett revealed now in the US business channel CNBC that he bought IBM shares worth $ 10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM thus with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM so far had known some of the commitment.
He praised the management which had ensured even in the economic crisis still decent profits.
"You have done a great job," said Buffett's strategy.
IBM opts for the lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for quite some time.
Of the more than 100-year-old physicist offers also software and consulting to, as well as powerful business calculator.
Buffett had technology firms to date rather shunned.
He says he will invest only in companies whose business he also understand.
Instead, Buffett continues to such as a freight railway at a lubricants manufacturer or mechanical engineers.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns in addition to about 80 own subsidiaries also shares in a number of major corporations like Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-Jährige had taken over the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it to one of the most valuable companies in the world with wise investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
Therefore, he is a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of the money-making has earned him the nickname of "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of the Buffett investment, Aktiengesellschaft, the IBM stock rose one percent.
"Big blue", as IBM is also called, is a total of more than $220 billion worth on the stock exchange and thus along with Apple and Microsoft is among the most valuable technology company in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said he would not go but.
Founder of Bill Gates was a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the detection of the "Zwickauer cell" doubt Turkish media at the German rule of law.
A newspaper even mentions a "bloody ideology", which again live.
The murders of eight Turkish gang members and a Greek small businesses in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-extremist background.
This message is responded to in Turkey and in the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
Because for many German Turks long dead geglaubtes the ghost returns thus: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993 there has been no comparable power with right-extremist background against Turks.
That there are xenophobia in Germany, was still never in question.
The right extremist network face-up but reveals proportions, whose Dimension is already impossible to predict.
"The bloody ideology lives on again?" headlined the Internet Edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", however, stressed that one of the perpetrators was an informer of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities in the right-wing radical swamp might be involved.
Considered the Turkish village of Germany responded: you are reminded at the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish leaders in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of German-Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.
In cheerful colours, the balance was staged as a story of success.
Since the reporting of some Turkish media seems like a slap in the face: "Germany's gift to the 50th" reads the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which expounds the backgrounds of serial of murders.
Also the Germany Edition of the "Hürriyet" can not resist, making this Association.
"It begins to stink", is the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
It is stressed that people were murdered, who paid taxes and would have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
The conduct of the police is extremely critical in German-Turkish Internet forums and discussed the later success of the investigation.
Why it not much more was invaded the German authorities, to search for suspects in extremist circles the authors wonder.
Some shows are at least rhetorically to drastic means ready: "If here continue to carelessly, nothing else is so migrants left as self-defence and arming".
"This will probably be the best self-defense".
"The quality of education and adequate punishment of the entire network of inner peace in Germany depends very strongly", writes "Selenium".
What does it mean if the inner peace in Germany in danger is, demonstrated the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the ruins of Solingen is deeply rooted in the memory of German and Turkish.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that can lead to mistrust and distance in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the we feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at that time especially the failure of German policy was criticized after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
He sent a condolences to the President of the Turkish Republic, was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel but at the funeral service in Cologne after the arson attack of Solingen - Kinkel listed at that time in his speech, how many charges were the local Turks.
So, as the value of a person calculate according to the amount of his taxes.
The current Turkish media coverage shows, once again, the mistrust of many Deutschtürken in the local rule of law since then is how deep.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive clarification and reassessment of right-wing terrorism in Germany it needs this time open words.
The scandals the Zürisee Bank
The most adventurous Bank of Europe sits not in Italy or France, but in the Switzerland.
UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then slithers from one crisis to the next.
Now, a German is to set it.
So it had not thought themselves safe Axel Weber.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was in July become known, that he join a new job almost as spectacular 2013 would: Chairman of the Board of the Swiss banking giant UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, praised the Switzerland whether her beauty and the UBS whether their newfound solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"UBS has managed the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But in September it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A trader of UBS in London had bypassed all the Bank's security systems and approximately 1.7 billion euros of audited.
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, a banker marxloh not only in the Switzerland, had to go.
The President of the Board of Directors of UBS considered since then also defeated - and all ask: when will at last Axel Weber?
Already, it was announced that Weber must advise the Bank of February 2012 to.
And he takes over the Presidency of the Board of Directors already in may - not only in the year 2013, the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is hard.
Instead, it is not a banker, Professor of Economics and central bankers and would have certainly needed a training period.
In one fell swoop he then takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a Bank, which just once again proved that long ago "largest scandal Bank of Europe" deserves the title.
Because UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently, she was the biggest asset manager in the world — and on the other hand slides for years by a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems is saving the once-proud Swiss Bank.
It all began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also savvy Swiss asset manager had combines them with ambitious goals: you wanted to be a big number also in investment banking.
So managed the UBS 2007 with $1.6 trillion customer vermögender more money than any other Bank in the world.
And on the other hand it was advanced as an investment bank in the League of the world's largest banks.
This made impression.
The former banker and later longtime Professor of banking in Zurich told Hans Geiger: "My students I found out UBS then always as an example of a good Bank."
"From today's perspective, you ask yourself: how could I be wrong just so?"
He erred tremendously.
In 2007, it was for the first time revealed that something went wrong part in UBS.
Middle of the year Chief Executive Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, which was until then considered high intellectuals and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later you knew why he had gone.
The investment division of the Bank had the audited themselves with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To shoulder that, UBS announced a capital increase amounting to no less than 13 billion Swiss francs.
It found they actually investors however which, would have wrinkled on the many people until shortly before even the nose: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was so secret that it not even learned his name.
But that was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The Bank had to new multi-billion dollar losses announce Chairman Marcel Ospel, 2006 the Board of Directors at the second-best paid the Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, followed by the disaster: the UBS faced collapse in the face of their bad investments in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the State.
The National Bank bought from UBS for tens of billions problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation were six billion Swiss francs for a forced-convertible bond which she could become co-owner of the Bank.
The whole Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed it is dramatic for a small country, if it is home to large banks.
Finally, the total assets of UBS was 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of the Switzerland (see chart).
"Once again we could not save UBS", says Bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster the second joined.
A few months later surrendered the UBS tax dispute with the United States and declared himself ready to give customers vermögender the data, who probably had moved behind taxes with the help of the Bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions including criminal charge.
Thus the UBS known more or less openly, to have helped in tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that had been their capital has always been in the competition for rich clients: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of Chief Executive and Chairman of the Board.
And the exodus of deposits.
So, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central divisions within a few months: in investment banking through the false speculation and asset management through the help of tax evasion.
And just as it was a bit quiet, just as you thought, now the UBS will manage again, because this unfortunate dealer story follows: A single merchant shipping audited EUR 1.7 billion, before the Bank realizes that something has gone wrong.
And it will be obvious: with the risk management in investment banking it doesn't obviously always still.
"With the fall of Adoboli one has realise that controlling risk has changed too little", says Martin Janssen, an economist and Professor of finance at the banking institution of the University of Zurich.
Also the CFO of a major German bank is sure: "The problem of UBS is that she has the control not under control."
While it had been but just the idea of caution, with the Swiss came to bankers long ago, to be guardians of the great assets of the world: no excessive risks, ensure security for the money - the world liked break down beyond the Alpine Republic times.
The vaults of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly fine chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the elegant Swiss private bank - it is just a bit larger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank is headquartered at the Zurich railway station road, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are palatial, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss tradition shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks reside here: by the National Bank of the Palace of the Credit Suisse up to elite private banks like Julius Baer.
Entering the reception hall of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are marble streamlined, prior to that, thick leather chair next to the Bank logo are a great sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what is looking for the customer here: security.
Two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have displaced but eventually this idea of the Swiss bank - or betrayed as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds.
Rather he wants to read his name in the newspaper, finally he makes business like all Swiss Bankers, also with the two big banks.
UBS has become far too big, he - finds particularly in investment banking, where also the Anglo-Saxons had spread.
The Swiss would have to say nothing more.
"And if they are, they have adapted long customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact it was investment banking which changed the UBS, earned her first high profits, and then the debacle the Anglo-Saxon: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the sub prime jungle such as the Swiss banking giant.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was visible.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest bailout in the history of their nation", writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion Swiss francs, or around 45 billion euros granted the politicians to save the standing before bankruptcy major bank.
How could it happen?
Talking with Swiss Bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks teamed up to a huge group.
It was a bank that was too big on the merger grew for the small Switzerland - and always on.
Helped that two different precursor banks of UBS complemented himself: a rich, but sleepy Bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers conveniently came to much money they could use to turn a giant wheel.
Two names are connected with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 CEO of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought, Wuffli and Ospel had a dream team", says Bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high intellectuals, humble, who understands much of models and statistics and Ospel, the belly man who is above has worked up by the banking apprenticeship until quite."
But Ospel had rely finally on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: high spirits came before the fall.
Employees of UBS clearly remember the managers meetings, where CEO Wuffli were repeated from same slogan: Goldman Sachs come from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful Investment Bank in the world.
It led to the "League tables", leaderboards, documenting the success of the banks of at the time.
Then, UBS wanted to at the top.
Some steps were already succeeded her.
In the foreign exchange and equities trading she starred at the top.
Management consultant, which were commissioned, but stressed a weakness: in the international business of interest, in the language of the bankers "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance to the biggest banks.
UBS have gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that the existence of almost cost them.
Hungry invested for growth, both the Bank itself as well before their based hedge funds in American subprime assets.
It developed itself into a huge machine, which packaged securities based on us mortgage loans and submitted further - retained risks but also themselves.
Even when other banks long searched for the phase-out.
"UBS there has bought in the summer of 2007, when the US real estate market on fire,", says Bank expert violinist.
So great euphoria, so the case deep.
A Manager after another had to go as the attempts to clean up were harder than expected.
Post at UBS became the ejection seat and are still shaky.
Who leads the banking giant, has a nearly impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a Bank, which all nearby business models are on hand come.
Bank research Geiger has already an idea: an end to investment banking, focusing on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
Quite so far the Bank wants to not go though (yet).
But the investment banking is to shrink significantly, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new Bank Chief Sergio Ermotti of the world will present its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was intended only as a temporary solution, as the Bank is surprisingly by predecessor Grübel separated.
In the meantime he has prevailed: he is to permanently carry on the business of UBS, Zurich Bank communicated on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return mid-nineties to the Investment Bank to the State.
He deletes 3500 places.
This is not enough however.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What will she make money?
These are the questions, which now already turns Axel Weber.
Publicly, he only says he will look once an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.

Smart crows spread between cities
In many places, rooks are considered "Problem birds": but the highly intelligent animals can no longer distribute from the cities, experts claim.
Some love it, others want to get rid quickly: crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities, residential complaints pile of dirt and noise of animals.
It is a remedy for the "problem"birds not yet in sight.
Rooks were from the cities not out more to get, said experts at the first symposium of the Crow in the East Frisian leer.
There, specialists from all over Germany of possible resources advised.
Looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists attributed the problems in cities it also to the rural exodus of the specially protected rooks: the use of chemicals in agriculture are increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing construction and the cases of typical breeding trees the birds made difficult life.
Crows are.
There are large colonies more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westphalian Soest, in the Northwest in Jever, Diepholz, and Achim, near Bremen, among others, as well as empty.
There, a controversial project to the mass killing of crows in the district had 2005 created negative headlines.
Critics had called the trapping of animals in some and the slaying with clubs particularly brutal.
"Nothing brings the normal displacement, the Vergrämen," the urban and landscape designers detected empty Werner Klöver from.
Nests away spraying with water or trees cut, have often undesirable consequences, the environmental expert Manfred Emperor of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg, also said.
"The animals back out, split large colonies on and distribute elsewhere."
Vergrämung is conceivable only as an exception to hospitals, old people's homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we no longer get away."
Without the surrounding area leave does not solve the problem in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner out empty.
A combination of Vergrämen of animals from sensitive residential and bait advertising is possible to resettle them again in other places.
"Information boards instead of chain saws" recruited, however, the psychologist and anthropologist UTA Maria of Jürgens for an entirely different use of the animals: "we can finally best confidently endured A pimple on the face."
Had crows trail co-founded Jürgens in Schleswig-Holstein the ash's, where signs of life the highly intelligent rooks inform.
The project will now already adopted by tourists.
Also to the criticism of the noise of the birds, an opinion had Jürgens: "There is plenty of communication, who have to say much."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: rooks use tools not only to get a treat, but even make your tool as a tool.
Behavioural scientist of at Cambridge of University tested recently on four rooks, how far does the intelligence of birds.
In an experiment, the birds soon learned that they must bring a framework with stones down, so to obtain a moth larva.
Without much training, they realized purposefully what size and shape must have a stone to make the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the clever crows had to then solve a kniffligeres problem.
In a vertically set cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With its beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However the researchers had put pieces of wire them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, which they then angelten the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four rooks this was even at the first attempt.

Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive and generous starts Peter Englunds's new book "Beauty and terror." "Tells a story of World War I, in nineteen fates" with a long list of characters which one goes to heart.
Here's a tip, what you could do: simply cutting out this page carefully and make them to your bookmarks.
You will learn about these people in Englunds romanhafter story very well. And these principals will work as your GPS as a lighthouse in those few moments where you lost men and women in the fog of war such as Englunds and your illusions are deprived.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature.
He has written an extraordinary book that he describes as "a work of anti-history" not poorly.
It contains just a few big names, major contracts or famous battles. There is little Ambassador, rabid reporter or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he said but rather "a book about it, as it was". It is of "Emotions, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and terror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less discreet men and women on both sides of the war together, schoolgirl and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose a limb, be crazy, or die.
Each of these life flickers as the Votivkerzen in a church, some come, while others go out.
Englunds book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the first world war was only the devastating atmosphere on the Western front.
"Beauty and terror" moves with expert views on other battlefields: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Fall beehives on the soldiers in this book, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
Almost from the outset, this is a moving book.
The war flooded the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, which smells of cordite.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children, and cannon fire heard in the distance. Stay or take flight?
Whoever comes at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happens or why this war ever occurs.
"Missing facts", Englund notes "were with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors revamped."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, a British nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were collected mainly memories, letters and other already published material.
Their life stories can be frightening or poignant, but they are very alive in Englunds of losing details collection of small moments.
Many of them deal with shortages and to manage.
In the history of a German Schulmädchens, telling: "replacement, anywhere replacement."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminium, false Eraser, paper associations, buttons."
He tells more of the spare supper in Germany.
He describes "meat, was made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and most recently was served with a wrong bones made of wood), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato peelings, shoes that were besohlt with wood."
There was, as he recorded "837 registered food substitutes who were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered substitutes."
Some stories deal with honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to the savagery and says about the war: "One feels that is that despite everything, what more was intended for men to sit with the Abendblatt bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, as in an armchair, and to do so, when such a facade mean civilization, and as if there were no barbarism behind the own stronger and MISTED Shirtfront."
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he will probably die and nobody of note taking or worry about.
"If you take distance from thought, to sacrifice themselves, one would like to think that this is done before an audience", he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations be of old Europe, which falls apart, and new types of terror.
"The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition," Englund writes "a war between the factories."
He begins a the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still-young century": "The word applied and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a tailor-made suit, which slaughters, while behind a desk sitting."
People behave in unexpected ways, and there are also frivolous behavior such as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers actively trying to infect himself with a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease to escape the Frontdienst.
"The grotesque expression can be detected in the trade of gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and is smeared on their genitals to come in the hope, as in the hospital", he writes.
"Those who were really desperate, rubbing it in the eye, what caused that they were blind to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter graves, Englunds poetry is supple and yet unobtrusive and adapts itself perfectly to his human duty.
In dozens of small scenes he captures a way, like war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why they bring their leaders to fight.
The best books about the first world war were usually rather distorted like Paul Fussells "great war and modern memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarque "West nothing new" as a comprehensive history books.
Englunds band joins a Bohemian Hall of Fame.
His book has the worst end, from which I've read in a non-fiction book.
I am no longer produced it.
But it is as if he would have caught us off with his book of this page with the main characters in the face and lit with a match.
After an early mistake a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wore use helmets.
We opted for the night from Monday to Tuesday because at this time there are hardly any people in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials have been informed. All the others initially believed to take part in an exercise.
Police Chief Raymond W. Kelly was among them, and his presence underscored the fact that put the operation full of challenges.
The events of the last few weeks as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which is against the rules of the program and provided a huge increase in public sympathy with the squatters, allowed to repeat themselves no longer.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by they were watching how occupations in other cities were handled.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall's Iceland.
Officials increased the so called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the quick set of a large number of police officers - to concentrate on lower Manhattan.
The last training session was held Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to move into the Park, came "at the last minute", said someone who with commanding the familiar is what spoke for a declaration as an "Exercise".
"The few police officers who I know were involved did not know that it went around the Zuccotti Park", someone who wishes to remain anonymous said.
"The only ones who knew that it went around the Zuccotti Park, were the senior officials of the Department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that had come to the city.
On 14 October, officials wanted to give the Park, differed back then but, when hundreds of protesters along came after they had learned of these plans.
Officials of from different police units were involved in the operation Tuesday, including Einsatzkommando from throughout the city - hundreds of mobile official, usually used in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that in the course of the day, many people in the Park enter and leave, almost like commuters, so that 1 am is a good time in the night to go.
"It was appropriate to do so, if the minimum number of people in the Park," he said.
Ambulance with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before departure at Pike slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the prerecorded messages that boomed from the speakers, many protesters seemed to intimidate.
As the public officials invaded their bright blue jackets in the Park, many protesters cover together simply their belongings and left the place.
Police said that by 1: 45 P.m. no tents would be handled, to give the protesters time to pack their belongings and goods together.
Other teams of officials were seen, how they are gathered in the area, to intervene, arrests in the Park should be necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the Park.
Paul j. Browne, spokesman for the Chief of police, said that this had happened to their own safety.
But many journalists say that you wanted to keep them from, to observe the police actions in the Park. And they said the handling of civil servants had been very rough.
Mr Browne said that television trucks had can make the Park photos in Church Street on the West side.
When were moving the police towards the West by the great confusion on personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turf, and bags with clothes, followed her the cleansing Department employees who picked up what was left.
Some protesters who refused to go were to dragged out there. Pictures about this appeared a short time later on the Internet.
A main core of protesters took position in the vicinity of the kitchen area of the camp in the Centre of the Park.
Some erected barriers and police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp tied together on her arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to lot what.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests in the park were conducted until about 3: 30.
The evacuation was completed according to the police after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said that 142 people in the park were arrested.
The most arrests occurred, he said, because of "Improper behavior and resistance to an arrest".
The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph j. Esposito, the head of the Department, the highest uniformed official in the Department.
Phil t. Pulaski, Department Chief of detectives, was also there.
Despite his presence "Mr. Kelly directed" "the operation not", as Mr Browne said.
In the event that they should be accessed, waited a second group of officials on the East side of Broadway, between liberty and Cedar streets.
Barricades were erected at Cortlandt Street, a block north of the Park, and in the Pine Street, one block further South.
It could be observed as from these locations the police further expanded the perimeter around the Zuccotti Park around.
In one place many of them with obstruct, persons observed, as several officials after drove out there.
About 28 persons were located in the Northern District.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the South of the Park.
At 5 P.m. a protesters on the roof of a police vehicle jumped South of Pine Street and other protestors let out the air of the tyre of a police bus.
The amount a piece of plywood threw in one place.
At the end of an official and a protesters to the hospital came.
Trade Union of the workers will submit complaint against the city due to layoffs
The Union, which represents hundreds of school workers that their jobs lost last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies due to their inappropriate influence on the schools, teaching poor students, were unnecessary and discriminatory.
The suit is probably the last option which is still open to the Trade Union, District Council 37, in their efforts to undo the redundancies.
Six hundred Zweiundsiebzig school volunteers, care coordinators and other staff who belonged and on 7 October in a move had lost their jobs, have described the leaders as political revenge for that one last year had refused access to a health fund, the working groups entertained, the city, with which the budgetary gap should be closed to the worst paid employees of the city.
This accusation categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council Dennis M. Walcott, Director of schools, said last month the redundancies were part of the budget that we have adopted in June.
A member of the City Council fired back and explained to him that in the budget not specify that the school help people would be laid off.
Officials of the 37 City Council said they had and the Ministry of education warned a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference, on the submission of the complaint before the Supreme Court in Manhattan is formally announced.
The action is Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of education of the city as defendants list and score eight laid-off workers as plaintiff, which are all colored or Latin American women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said the complaint would be not for the city, and thus their individual claims could not be commented.
According to a case design that is the New York Times, the Union has focused on the number of redundancies at the schools in the poor districts of the city, to support an action for unequal treatment. She claims that poor schools would have lost more helpers, because they are chronically under-funded.
You sets forth that while there were no redundancies to Staten Iceland and only a few redundancies in the schools of the upper east side or TriBeCa, lost 17 school helper in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers in the 8 and 9 in the South Bronx districts were dismissed.
Noting the loss of five of eight school workers who were employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students in poverty live, the lawsuit says: "This is no neighborhood of wealthy parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of 36. District was reduced this year by 3.26 percent. Also, funds were lost when the city changed their method of calculation for the extra funding for any poor schools enrollment.
The Union also complained that the heads of high schools were discharged by the language in a memo to mislead, which approved the dismissal of care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess", to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: transfer) in the United States usually the change of a teacher from the payroll of a school in a pool available workers describes, which are paid by the Central Office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," States the action design.
Mission ended, Congress prepared with regard to Libya communicate
It finally looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington were already, to communicate with regard to the riots in Libya.
Everything that was necessary for this purpose was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the cessation of American interference.
On Thursday, the Committee for international relations of the Senate approves a resolution, which is under the Chairman John Kerry (mass.) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), where it praises Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "courage".
"This resolution honors the brave people of Libya, who have started with the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry.
"It's a confirmation of support its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far, nothing was easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawmakers of both parties and the White House disputed the wording of a number of resolutions to the approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain put forward a resolution which approved the limited use of military forces of the United States in Libya.
The law has been rejected by a broad fringe group of both parties in the Senate and there was no vote.
But on the same day this Bill in the Senate fell through. In addition, the Chamber overrode a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
Thus the U.S. Mission fell into a kind of legislative purgatory — with a Congress that was indeed upset enough to criticize Obama's approach, within the framework of the mission but not angry enough to finally pull away the ground him.
Then, the indecision of the Congress of the events was overhauled.
Tripoli fell in August under the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
NATO's mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate is now perhaps ready to act.
Resolution of the Committee on international relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and their extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partners that support the military operations to protect of the people in Libya, for their exceptional bravery and their professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirmed "the national interests of the United States on Libya a successful and irreversible transition to democracy".
Will the new measures receive the full support by the Panel for foreign relations or are they the lawmakers split, as did the law of June?
The latest version encounters the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), of the Committee's top Republican.
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he has still not seen the final version of the new law.
According to the United States Capitol, it lies on the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional Legislaturperiode of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the budget or other area, which currently comes to a vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far unsuccessfully tried to bring their changes, although they have tried often enough to vote.
Goodlattes change is just one of 68 constitutional changes that were submitted to this Congress and include a whole range of topics.
Some are duplicated--the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate and others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of the change in compensation budget and a further dozen that "would control federal spending" alone in the Senate.
Some of the laws are also identical, but they admit the possibility that their clients - especially beginners at the Republicans who want to Polish up your CV - brag that they "have authored such a measure".
The budget control Act, which was passed in August, requires that Congress about a change of equilibrium as well as Senate vote.
In March, 58 Senators for a non-binding resolution voted, supports the idea of such a change.
The budget also, some members want can submit the number of provisions, members of Congress, limit, while the Republican wants to remove the limit of two terms of President Jose E. Serrano (New York).
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has a number of changes proposed, which guarantee, inter alia, the right to a good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage under sex is a recurring template as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators want to also allow the repeal of federal laws, if two-thirds of the States reject them.
As eager as the members suggest changes, so non-faster they move like in the past.
111. Congress submitted legislation of 77 such changes. 110. Congress 66.
The pace pales in comparison with the early 1990s, in which members every two years suggested regularly more than 150 changes, so the numbers that makes the Senate library.
But they were not much better than today's.
The last change that add is - the 27-, ratified in 1992, proposed but in fact already in 1789 to the Congress.
"Hit, but not defeated", so Giffords in the first television interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man from closest distance had shot during an election rally in Tucson on them, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) occurred Monday night on national television. You sang alone at the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said the desire to recover, is greater than the to return to Congress.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer in "20 / 20" ABC News, rank it according to and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed heavy slow recovery from the damage that caused the bullet that pierced her skull split, the left side of their brain and crosses her head from the front to rear.
Three months ago she returned surprisingly in the Congress, to cast their votes to the debt brake triumphantly.
In her first television interview after the assassination in January, killed six people and injured 13 in which smiled Gifford, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied: "Quite good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" specials, recorded shortly before the release of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The special tracks Giffords recovery since the assassination of the January 8.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see it in the hospital bed, with bald-shaven head and a long scarf over the forehead.
She can raise only one or two fingers when her husband encouraged it.
Giffords months later sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nod his head.
A twitching with the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She want that their breakfast is changed.
Videos that play on the ABC show, show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: man looks like the members of Congress along with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "girls just wanna have fun" and Tom of petty's "Free Fallin' '" sings.
Giffords who spends two hours a day with therapy, that she can not remember the day of the attack, said in an interview with Sawyer.
Her husband said that he had read an article in a newspaper about the assassination Giffords on 12 March, had been killed when she interrupted him and asked for the first time after six people during the assassination.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forcibly medically treated, while he waits for his trial.
"Many people have died," told Giffords Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of recovery of his wife, so told Kelly Sawyer, she said: "I was hit."
"So, I would say:"Gabby, you're not defeated"?", Kelly said.
You have just taken.
And you will get this through and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street Gala, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss.
Gathered on a keyword to one hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in black Tuxedo stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and servicemen were seen as heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A senior military officer at the Gala, which was observed by the Chief of staff and former Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, looked different to the role played by the troops.
"They were introduced such as orphans," wrote the officer in an E-Mail.
I'm sure the organizers have meant it well.
I know that.
But it really wasn't no respect. It was pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and the American public usually distanced, sometimes admiring.
The troops will be showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say Dienstangehörige.
The general public behaves suffering increasingly so, as it did the people in uniform.
"We were not victims", said Brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in the Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently is the only way that support is the one to squeeze us into the role of unfortunate souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders who want to appear not ungrateful or in conflict with the public which they serve.
They have also recognized that the rage in recent years of the Viet Nam war against struck the returning troops, was much worse.
As a result, talks about compassion in the breastfeeding and private between veterans of war take place.
After his two sons from fights with the Marines have returned, the Colonel (Ret.) mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military realm could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would regard it with a sense of AWE as she rebels defeated and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a "raging, violent veteran beneath the surface" hides, said Cancian, who had fought in the Iraq and has acquired a high State post in Washington after his return.
During his employment, he said he felt that some of the interviewers subtly erfragten whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"If you talk about your service, you must keep the negative impressions, however," Cancian explained his sons.
The missing ease of the military is rooted in part on behalf of the Americans in the war missing.
Services on the battlefield will be from a country that has little experience with the military, and sees little benefit in the wars in the Iraq and Afghanistan, singled out rarely as praise.
"We as a nation appreciate military heroism no longer so, as it was absolutely normal in the second world war", said Lieutenant General David Barno (Ret.), who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a Dienstangehörigen.
Troops gain recognition for the number of attacks that they have endured, the number of friends who have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military is under increasing pressure to the harsh crackdown on rape
This week, a major hearing decides whether 28 women and men are indicted for non-intervention in a rape before the military court.
Should it happen not hundreds of applicants for the next hearing are available.
Upper Gefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 week pregnant, when she was raped by a soldier colleagues at night.
It was in October 2008 and returned straight to their barracks in Miramar, North of San Diego from dinner with a friend, when she met a male colleague, a 12 Pack wearing beer with him.
He asked her whether he should accompany them for a drink in your room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texas brushed aside their concerns.
I thought: "Oh what, is he 19."
"He is from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they had walked in Lyman's room, was the man behind her, pressed it down and raped her, she claimed.
Lyman and 27 other present and former military employees anxiously waiting this week, on 18 November, for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, decided whether a complaint they have collected against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, is allowed in court.
The suit alleges that gates and Rumsfeld right of the soldiers are those that have not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional.
In February by Susan Burke, submitted a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the suit initially 17 plaintiffs, which rose but in the following months to 28 included: 25 men and three women, who all claim that by colleagues of the soldiers have been raped or sexually abused, and that the military failure to identify, condemn or appropriate case law after the alleged attack to make a.,
Burke says she follow the top military leadership since the problem there will start.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals that are in the position, the culture retaliation to eradicate the?" "The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted almost 400 more survivors since February, many of them could be part of future actions.
Their strategy: instead that all plaintiffs lay eggs in a basket so to speak, they will submit, if necessary, many more complaints, to maintain the pressure.
The team of defence for the Ministry of defence, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, submitted a request to dismiss the lawsuit.
The files of the Court, which are Newsweek, lead to in detail the defense strategy in the first place, that the military can, are accused by current or former soldiers for violations which have occurred in the armed forces.
Pursuant to a law of the Supreme Court from the year 1950, the so-called Feres Doctrine, liable the Government not for injuries, which currently soldiers are added to the active duty.
"The alleged damages during the military service of the applicant", says the document.
The Defense Ministry denied any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women still not to serve in the fight are allowed, so the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
Both the Iraq and Afghanistan play increasingly important roles, especially in contact establish teams of soldiers with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars 150 servicemen died two thirds of them in combat.
It is time that the military is being modernised, says Burke.
And she is not alone in their fight: three more complaints except their are pending.
At Yale Law School the Veterans' prepares legal a lawsuit against the four main military academies due to alleged support of a misogynistic atmosphere services clinic.
Thereof regardless which collects non-profit Viet Nam Veterans of America a lawsuit against the military before, where the diagnosis of "Personality disorder" focusing, received the rape victims to dismiss them from the service - a usual practice according to activists such as ANU Bhagwati of service women's action network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed lawsuit against the Veterans Administration (GER.: management of the war veterans), in which she her discriminatory practices in her dealings with power demands for persons accused, which stated that to be sexually abused been in service.
Nine laws was submitted independently the Congress through a mixture of Senators and representatives of both parties, providing a series of clues.
2010 were according to the sexual assault prevention and response Office (German: Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse) displayed DoD 3,158 sexual abuses.
But the most abuses are not reported at all, and on the Pentagon's own estimate account this number approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases which occur each year.
The report, which was published in March, examined the law enforcement rates: 2010 20 per cent of recorded cases in the military court came, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, so she says she was asked 11 times to tell the details of their rape of a number of policemen, doctors, and military commanders.
Had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex it had before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people said as Charakterzeugen in the name of the alleged offender who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember well the day when the verdict was read out", says Lyman.
"I thought the contractions would use." "I ran screaming from the courtroom."
"They brought me in the psychiatric department and I remember that I, when I came out, said to my Commander: this was not his procedure." "That was my method."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist, who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder, and declared for members.
In January 2010, she was dishonourably dismissed so that she receive no support.
Whether the complaint, Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed, progress, is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of law at the George Washington University law school.
Nevertheless, as he noted: "My opinion they should come forward."
What is between them and a verdict is this doctrine which is criticized, since it was taken for the first time in question.
Throughout his life, I am a critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military lags a decade, because they have not the same incentive and the same deterrence, which brings a liability.
He adds: "the odds are against them... but it is important for them that they try it."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing follows not their way, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiff, will begin with their hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will fight on the military in this respect, until it comes to reforms", she says.
Or until we die, what occurs also as first.
Walls have eyes: how researchers watch on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many guys who sent their anti immigration opinion online.
On Monday Breivik, who has been committed in a killing spree in Norway in July to have, where 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has much time spent to his attack before his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists, who support extreme right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how to find it?
This is easy - you must log in only on Facebook.
"We have noticed that it was not difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report of the British think-tank DEMOS of digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding place personal data is so enzyklopädisch, Bartlett says that the researchers simply must use the advertising tool of page, to set your desired demographic data with scientific accuracy exactly - so how marketers for years do it.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing extremist groups throughout Europe and she proposed to then adds, but instead of going with a new band or a new diet product to link, the adds invited users to a survey, in which according to their level of education, their attitude towards violence and assessing their own future was asked.
Bartlett and his colleagues able to consult more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without them even once had to leave her Office were thanks to Facebook.
"It is a new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprising. Online sponsors of right-wing extremist groups are mostly young, male and fret about immigration.
But in a surprising twist "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism rational, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
DEMOs work is just one example, as Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, scientist and medical researchers are using the site, to study everything from health issues to social trends such as in "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add three content per day on average, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom, who in the past five years to nearly 800% increase in the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title.
For some researchers, it is beauty of Facebook the fact that one can study through this site people, that is usually not reached his Clipboard on the road.
"If you previously tried to interview people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to first inform the party and would have granted never access them," Bartlett says.
"On Facebook falls it all away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the page provides a way to identify social health problems and to solve.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken stupor on Facebook tend significantly more to the problem drinking as students who were silent on this subject.
Moreno proposes equal students, such as the residential Advisor, to monitor the page and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can not solve a problem, if you have not recognized", said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno co-author and Director of child health, behavior and development at children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook taps constantly to the data of its own population.
The data team of page has created statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's day, turnout at the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (and first and foremost information were used, that only Facebook has access - master of digital freedom for a long time know that the page should make available their large data found mine to others for research purposes.)
However, the users of Facebook know that the page they observed whether they now want that or not. With a friend who is thousands of miles away to be able to play Scrabble, to bring out the own personal data allows one the page.
But what, if the users of Facebook are part of a survey, which they don't even know something?
While researchers have laid down strict guidelines, how they collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users of the fact thought that a researcher might study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London knowledge lab, a study from the year 2006, in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As regards it, went there only to them and their friends."
Then there is the question of the methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information provided in a user profile and contributions are true.
"What they say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things" says Selwyn.
Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as a technology research that a Clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no substitute for this to get out into the real world and to speak with real people", he says.
"Social research must worry about the social - and social life of lots of takes place yet always offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed two rampages where this summer 77 people were killed in Norway, has described fighters even in its first appearance in a public court in Oslo as a "resistance".
"I'm a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knights Templar of Norway," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I raise an objection to the Court because you have received your mandate of organizations that support the ideologies of hate and this supports the multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I plead not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monologue because he "not wanted to allow Breivik, to take advantage of this consultation, on which he can express his views as a platform."
For the same reason he refused Breivik, who brought an advance written speech, permission to use at the end of the hearing on the relatives of his victims.
Nesheim also arranged that retains the Breivik police for 12 more weeks in custody, four weeks has no access to the media. He said that the authorities over a period of eight weeks exactly will control all visits and all correspondence.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some were hoping to be able to see Breivik in the eye, others wanted the confirmation that he remains behind bars.
All took part in order that everything on a closing off amounts.
"I thought he looks cold and inhuman," a survivor told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK about Utoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a bit further after I've seen the suspects and heard."
Breivik wore a dark suit and blue tie and worked during the whole hearing, calmly and professionally. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered the building and left.
Despite Breiviks bizarre note, he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill the judge and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Like some like it, that apparently the work of a single extremists was the attacks on 22 July and not the a group radicals.
But this automatically facilitates the grief and the confusion that still feels a whole nation?
"I wish he would look like a monster, but he does not do", said the family members of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he would do it."
7 Lessons of the interview with the late Steve jobs, which was shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve jobs on 5 October, some comparing it to Henry Ford and thereby stressed the engineering genius as a large modern inventor.
What Apple fans but perhaps most aufschlussreichsten find jobs-interview recently again discovered, which was dusted down this week before special film screenings in the major markets, is how much this creative mind understands business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organiser who worked diligently on charts - a man who believed that many Managing Director suffer from "a disease of thought", "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work..." [but] there is a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product.
1995 developed Bob Cringely TV-series "Triumph of the specialist" on the dawn of the personal computer. And he sat with longer than one hour jobs, where they led a rare, detailed discussions.
At this time were as 10 years passed since jobs from Apple was marginalized. And he was already hard working on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide adoption of the Internet.
While a small part was used by Cringleys interview in specialist, he says that the copy templates of the interview in the delivery were missing.
Only after jobs death discovered a full copy of the VHS in the garage of the Director.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68minuetigen film "Steve Jobs: the lost interview", which is this Wednesday and Thursday at the landmark theater.
For someone who has known that he abhors extensive interviews, jobs appears here surprisingly eager in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview there is 10 or 15 seconds contemplation, where jobs weigh his thoughts clearly and order accuracy is trying four times longer pauses between question and answer.
There are also moments in which jobs' perfectionism is days when he seemingly impatient responds to Cringelys questions and it anschubst, to respond faster to issues or subplots of greater significance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded the lost interview appears somehow weird far-sighted if jobs rated, what do other companies of in his view true or false and represents its own vision on the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous tributes of career jobs'. But here to see jobs, who is on the verge of greatness, as the greedy dreamer is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he everything had done this here, he moved off and made it.
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of lost interviews:
He learned how to run a business:
"During the whole year in the business, I always ask:"Why you are doing things?"." And the answer that you get always, is: "Oh, so it is done simply."
No one knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business really in-depth thinking about things.
I've found that.
Further, jobs performs his efforts to streamline the accounts at Apple.
Dumbfounded, as costs were recorded - usually began with standard cost"", were estimated at a mere presumption towards, which were then adapted with "Deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the costs could be determined up to the smallest.
How was ridiculing the Pope:
A device with which one could creep into the telephone company and long distance lead free tells of the "blue box", which he has built with Steve Wozniak, jobs.
Much has been written about the device, but jobs enthusiasm, as he describes the blue box as an act of empowerment is infectious.
He also describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, make a call and is then connect by an AT &amp;amp;amp; T network to another while she grinding as many satellites as possible through.
"We sent things a half a dozen times around the globe and when you grölte in the phone, it came out a minute later next door back in the phone," chuckling tells jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we ourselves can build something, that can control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We both, we knew not much but we were able to build this small thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think that Apple would be without them.
Jobs retold from a glorious prank the Wozniak and he almost had deducted, when she called box in the Vatican in the dead of the night via blue and wanted to speak with the Pope, while it as best they could have made to Henry Kissinger.
Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the dead of night to talk with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh off before the Pope himself on the phone came.
As he fell in the technology (and unprepared called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts, to build a frequency counter, he sought Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, jobs got a part time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable influence on me." "It was the only company that I'd seen in the age and it shaped my views about what was a company and how well it treated its employees."
Later became jobs of one of HP employees who visited the laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer that ever made".
He was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell in love in him.
I would climb upwards at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine, and write programs for it.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview talks jobs in, how you invent spontaneously new products.
Early in his career, when he built some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment of only 30 days and had to think through both the Assembly and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later at Apple he remembers the problems that he had in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember disruptive arguments..." "They shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse, that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse, we build them for $15. That was incredibly believable.
About large companies that allow to:
Long before he revive Apple, jobs predicted the paths on which so many industrial giants with their visions came in tripping and lost control of their shares.
"We say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, na and?"
Have the monopoly on share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it successful, so [there are such people], which eventually lead the company and the product with which the people from decision-making are pushed.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly is eradicated vs. bad products, people who have no concept about good products - craftsmanship necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox would have to have the entire computer industry.
You could have ten times greater, could have the Microsoft of the 1990s...
You have caught defeat from victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"A lot of handicraft, situated between a great idea and a great product... If you developed this great idea, she changed and is growing."
You can learn much about its intricacies.
You shall provide votes, certain things that you can't, but electrons, robot, glass factories.
You must memorize 5000 terms, these concepts, and they all bring together...
Ultimately it boils down to the taste, it boils down to that one, apart sits down with the best stuff that people have created, and then seeks to bring together these things on what to do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made great Macintosh, was that the people who work there, musician, poet, artist, zoologist, historian were, which happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
It was not the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health laws, as court takes case
A day, around which the Supreme Court behind closed doors gather, to discuss the question of political sharing, whether it will hear a challenge of health laws by President Obama, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas attended, a dinner, which sponsored was by the law firm that represented the case to court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when met all nine members to a meeting to discuss the petitions to the test.
One of to treated cases was an action which raised 26 States against the far-reaching health care reform last year adopted by the Congress, a law that anywhere was at the conservative activists in the United States a buzzword.
The judge agreed to the hearing. Actually a 5 is expected in March 1/2-hour basis for discussion, that probably will stimulate probably 2012 the presidential campaign whose outcome, which will be in full swing at the time at which the Court's decision is announced,.
The lawyer who before court and claim, that the law is to tilt, probably Paul Clement will, once Attorney-General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, a long-established group, dedicated to the defense of conservative principles.
Another undertaking, the dinner made, Jones day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of independent business, which challenge the law.
An another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., is greatly involved in financially as a result of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the Court about the case had advised, in a Washington Hotel.
Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a declared opponent of health care reform, among others had service
Dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: for years, the two judges attend events of the federalist society.
And that would not violate moral rules.
Indeed to judge of the code of conduct free, which governs the actions of the lower federal judge.
They were there, they would fall probably 4 (c) of the code under principle, which States the following: "A judge may on fundraisers law near and other participating organizations, where the judge no speaker, guest of honour or according to the program, not a guest of such events may be."
Nonetheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas were to two of related the case relating law firms as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this from, to alert the morality and Government activists.
"This amazing break with morality and the contrast with the code lie punishes the actions of some judges, the Court think the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of common cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending proceedings of the Court."
Their occurrence and their support of a fundraiser for this event undermined any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they would too easily mix legal issues with groups that be guided from the agenda, like for example the federalist society.
And that Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
However, claim the Conservatives that it was judge Elena Kagan, have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Attorney General under the Obama rule, the first law disputes in the first instance court.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias, because it involved too much in defense of the law, to be impartial.
Kagan makes no move to do so.
Boeing pulls record order of $18 trillion in land
Airline ordered 50 two-course aircraft of type Boeing 777s with an option for 20 more aircraft Emirates.
In addition Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $ 1 trillion.
It is really a rare message that a company gets an order for 50 units of its products.
But it is a big business, if is the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft in total is a record amount of $18 trillion.
The buyer of Boeing is also unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East requires series 2,520 aircraft worth $ 450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order of ever for commercial aircraft at the weekend, measured at the value of the order: 50 two-course Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer job came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline has also, Boeing it Dubai announced 2011 air show on the an option on the purchase of 20 additional aircraft that $ 26 trillion rise the entire list price.
On Monday, Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which dramatically improves fuel consumption and comfort of the passengers then ordered six according to Boeing Oman Air.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Exchange expert of Morningstar.
"The quality of this particular customer is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are in the possession of the oil-producing countries.
So, they have not only the money to pay for the aircraft. Rather, it is an increase in oil prices, which harms the airlines generally, because this is one of their biggest cost is not so harmful, as worthy of the country to a higher oil price.
This is important, because they tend less than other airlines to cancel aircraft orders or move, if oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural hedge," he said.
The order Emirates confirmed Boeing's leading position in the market for wide-body aircraft and helps to keep the SAS Airbus competitor in chess, attacking the supremacy with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would move the introduction of largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
You moved the introduction to gain more confidence, after the customers had demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67,94.
Sister of Mexican President apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa María Calderón claimed that drug traffickers helped opponents Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for Governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón has apparently lost their bid for the Office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favour of one of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results of the institutional the Revolutionary Party, the PRI, Fausto Vallejo has won the race for Governor in the Western State.
Luisa María Calderón said "The intrusion of organized crime during the entire electoral processes, and especially in yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country", in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls..." "They have booths occupied, roads built up... and instructed people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled the Presidency seven decades in Mexico, until they in 2000 lost.
But they strive for a return and in Michoacán, the victory is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just defeated Claderon, which still led in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolution Party, PRD, the currently incumbent Governor, a heavy defeat for the split and hapless left lead for the presidential election came in third place, 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the provisional results.
Vallejo, former Mayor of the capital city of Morelia, denying links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán for a long time was ruled by drug cartels, which specialize in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderón and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still continuing.
A PAN Mayor was killed a week before the election during an election debate for Luisa María Calderón and numerous candidates has risen out of fear from the local elections.
For the PRI victory strengthens the party, no matter, the elections in Michoacán also appear as distasteful.
The man probably represented the PRI in the race for the Presidency is Enrique Peña Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think that this victory can be boldly look us in the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help in the rescue of the euro area
The Development Bank of Asia (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls India and China, to support the rescue of the euro area in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the economy of Asia in its heavy debt crisis.
Rajat nag, Managing Director who ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies must do "everything in your power related" of the world, to speed up the recovery of move either by the International Monetary Fund or direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the countries of BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China), "dispassionate" overlooking the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of the European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We are all in the same boat."
"So everyone is helpful, which can help Europe out of this crisis," he told the financial times in an interview on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it is not immune."
"If China and India so can help then by all means."
Europe's Monetary Union came in the past months in a serious debt crisis.
The past few days Italy's interest costs increased to dangerous and the Prime Minister both Italy and Greece are resigned.
The emerging heavy debt crisis in Europe stoking fears that it could plunge the global economy into recession and led to calls the leading emerging economies would have to do together to support the euro-zone.
Mr nag predicted that any support of Asia is channelled through the IMF, but said that greater bargaining power offers mutual arrangements - such as for example the purchase of bonds of the EU Rescue Fund, the European Finanzstabilisierungsfazilität (EFSF) - European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do all what is in its power", since now suffers the own economy to help the euro area, falling exports and foreign capital flow drying out.
"No one wants that the euro area is still unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing great challenges and we need to receive a high level of growth."
"It is not an option, it is a job, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have is no reason to help the rich Europeans if they even face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at the Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million by $2 or even less on the day most live.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks with 50 to retire and spend some nice holidays at the beach." "Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Executive Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to Greece the numerous and well paid employees in the public sector to keep jobs in poorly Chancellor, a loss-making institutions such as around the railway.
Mr nag said that the crises in the euro zone will have "significant knock-on effects" on all of Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with economic growth to 7.5 per cent in Asia for the period 2011 / now threatens "the risk of the gradation" due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would need to create "Contingency plans" to protect itself for a downward trend and a significant Kapitalabwanderung of their Wortschaften.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defense
Defense Minister Leon Panetta heated up the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed. Thus, he unleashed a financial chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon to the battlefields in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon thinks through reductions in the amount of $450 trillion during the next decade already, but now fears that further cuts to $600 trillion or more necessary be if Congress did not graduate issues can be achieved.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the Ministry", Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress in achieving a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure would lead to 23% overall reductions, as well as an end to numerous new projects.
"Such a high reduction performed in such reckless ways, would most of our ship and construction projects make unenforceable - you can buy not three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We were also forced to involuntarily separate us from most of our civilian staff and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with certainly, to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously harm."
"The cuts were ultimately the combat forces meet", Panetta said.
"While the war time quotas in the fight for against terrorism by the seizure are not directly affected, the serious interference in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort", Panetta warned.
"Recruitment have been reduced, which would lead to delays in the settings and the setting's attendant, who support the war."
"Would cut the salaries of staff resulting in late payments to war time traders and legal as well as political support would be disturbed."
The two Senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of defence.
"The consequences of the confiscation of the Defence Ministry would launch a rapid decline of the United States as a leading military power in the world."
"We are strongly against this draconian action", said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they released the Panetta letter.
"This is a result with which we can not live, and it is certainly none that you should push us up."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and whose occurrence should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta letter and the new warnings of senators will increase the pressure on a compromise on the budget or demands will, step up to take the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta has expressed increasingly bluntly the possible cuts, although he could gain experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House many years before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is serious decisions to.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Minister painted a grim picture of what could be - come a military shell, but without core.
"There is a ship without sailors."
"It is a Brigade without ammunition."
"It is an air force without sufficient trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings, and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force lacking morality and alert and that is not in a position to take on potential opponents."
"You can get a really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta spearheaded new details, such as reductions "creates significant operating risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations of our global deployment and intervention capabilities, resulting in an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects of strike victim could fall including those that already have been tested and are already in the early planning stages.
This list includes also the fighter pilot strike fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the army and Navy need F35 joint to replace the Humvee.
Would you stop the continued development and testing of the F35, would this over the next 10 years save up to $80 trillion, but proponents say it is an important next step for upgrading, so that cannot be dispelled by China and other opponents possible dangers.
How is revealed to be a lie
A look at the current headlines shows deception and lies in everyday life are how widespread concern and far.
The presidential candidate of the Republican, Herman Cain, is busy to tackle the allegations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
The direction of Penn State is accused of perjury because it allegedly has held back reports, according to which a retired football coach sexually has abused boys.
Last week was with a liar heard over an open microphone, as the French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed the American President Barack Obama to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself fool, when he installed ABDICATIONS in circulation, which were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate of John Edwards is accused of violations in the campaign financing which is related to cover up an extramarital affair.
Then no one who has seen it, forgetting of course the media circus, which President Bill Clinton has thrown when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating in school and College exams are widespread.
There were incidents where teachers have given the exam responses their students, so that they were good even when their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite, sending a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception are we experiencing?
Studies show that we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies are but considered Marxist.
Another study shows that stranger lying to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To detect lies or "to uncover lies" is one that is important for everyone to learn, both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game as away to such charades, in which it is the target, "don't you!" to call, the Enttarnen of a deception is a serious knowledge based on scientific data, which were collected in the course of the past six decades at prestigious universities, who conducted extensive research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that the most ancient myths about the lies were unmasked.
Lies look one in the eye.
You stutter, stammer, blush, and suffer not always.
From this we may not conclude but that these liars are difficult to uncover and to unmask.
A skilled Lügenenttarner can penetrate to the truth by he learns about the structure of claims that the fine facial expressions, questions and timing.
I have spent several years to examine the scientific results of the extensive and ever-growing range of exposure. And it is clear that the Enttarnen of a deception is a modern capability that is easy to learn and helps us in finding your way around in our complex world especially when setting or the request of persons or negotiations or management belong to the own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good to appreciate other people, arousing their interest and control own emotions. And they feel intuitively, as others are perceived.
Thanks to the research we, extroverted people lie more often than introverted people know that men dish up more often "self oriented" lies than women whose lying more "focus on other" - usually, so they want to protect the feelings of others-, that married people less often lie to their partner than unmarried people (but the lies that they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that, if a person as a culprit was revealed to be other less feel guilty, to have lied to this person.
How to detect, whether someone is lying?
First by you observe the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It is for a reference point to later evaluate changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of their subject.
They should know better when someone usually constantly trips with the foot, so that they not accuse him if he trips during a meeting with the foot.
Then look for clusters of striking verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
See these clusters as alarm bells ringing, shrill as evidence an exposure.
People who deceive, maybe freeze when trying to remember their history. Perhaps have their feet towards the door or they sit in the direction of output, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxation after the interview", this deep, relaxing breath and the change in attitude, if all the hard questions are over.
Interrogative signal often erroneously that an interview is over, only to this relaxation after the interview to look.
Pay attention also to the language of your subject.
The crash of Scott Peterson is famous, as he used the past tense, as he claimed, his dead wife is live and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can use a distanzierende language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman..." "Miss Lewinsky" or if you reviewed a tricky question in a whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language", if they answer a tricky question: "well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know is... to the best of our knowledge and belief."
This, the answer is rather increasingly true as factual, which often ringing alarm bells.
There is no magic to the Enttarnen of lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to which an exposure is possible.
Thanks to these abilities, everyone can be rare victim of scam artists, both in the private like in professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is being revised after exposure by the delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama Government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, which one angered the unions and at the same time calmed environmentalists, the company be built the pipeline aims to reschedule the project so that you can return to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it will lead to the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building by Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company was still confident that the pipeline is ultimately approved, albeit with a different course.
This occurred after an announcement of the Foreign Ministry last week, after the one you would postpone a decision concerning a federal approval for the project, until the new possible course is verified, which avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska, as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, compared to Fox News.
The new environmental review, which has ordered the Foreign Ministry may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections in the coming year, although officials deny that politicians in the decision were involved.
Obama said in a written statement that the decision is a task of the Foreign Ministry last week and said his support.
The 1700 mile pipeline was Canada with the Gulf of Mexico link.
She would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
For this purpose, the pipeline would have to cross six States.
Environmentalists hate them, but they love labour markets, because they appreciate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But the legislature of Nebraska, who are opposed to the plan, weigh the laws to force a move away from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found out that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that that has requested a separate probe of the review procedure with principal investigator of the Ministry that focuses on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist who was recruited by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company was commissioned to carry out the original study, was an inappropriate choice because she is linked with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused because she allegedly forced a toddler out of fear to vomit
A New York family claims that the disco Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of their building section of Manhattan would get a maniacal attack, her little daughter had transferred so in fear that she have passed with fear.
The tirade of "Lady marmalade" singer made such fear that suffer them to "Personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers", the 18-month-old Genevieve monk said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year, when the stagehands Kevin monk, his wife Corporation, a kindergarten teacher, and Geneviève wanted to break up for a family outing.
While Kevin monk brought the car, Corporation monk went Boulevard with the luggage and Geneviève on the arm in the lobby in her building at Riverside.
Corporation monk said she had stopped near the door and dropped off her daughter for a moment.
"Someone was behind me and said:"You know what your daughter doing?"" "I said,"Yes", and went to take it again in his arms," she said.
Labelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"In an aggressive tone, said:" you should sell your daughter away from the door, said Corporation monk."
"I told her:"It interests me not what you say or think"."
She became angry and began to scold - it was very noisy and used the F word and the A word...
She had a bottle of water in his hand and began to tilt the water from the bottle at me.

Climatic adversities slowed down the economy
In his first year, Mario Lopez Valdez is the Government, rose in Sinaloa unemployment and undeclared work, while decreased foreign investment and the economy stagnated.
2011 Sinaloas in economic history will remain in memory. It is the first year, Mario Lopez Valdez, who identifies himself as the initiator of change and stirred up great expectations regarding economic growth, is in the Government. However, as a result of climatic adversity, no question can be growth, but on the contrary, the most important economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in the millions in agriculture, but put down narrow limits the growth of Economics in addition and caused a general decline in who goes economic activity by 3.6 per cent this mainly on the historic dismantling of agricultural development 31,16% in the first quarter back, had a surge impact on other sectors of the economy.
According to one of the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo rural report issued Sustentable (GER. Mexican Council for sustainable rural development) on the effects of frost 582 000 hectares of agricultural land damaged, of which 78,03% perfect and the remaining 21.07% were partially destroyed. Above all the vegetables, corn, and chickpea crops were affected.
The decline of economic activity through November have continually rise in the Mexican State unemployment. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid rise in unemployment in the first quarter because from January to March, 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, corresponds to what 4.53 per cent of the labour force. In the second quarter the unemployment rate increased to to 5,28% and from July to September 6,19%, resulting in 74 000 unemployed people in Sinaloa resulted. That is 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year comes from several factors. Economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of social sciences of the University Autónoma (UAS), commented on the policy of public institutions will explain the growing unemployment indirectly.
"What we are seeing now is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors." "With loss of liquidity on the market as a result of the reductions of appropriations by the legislation adopted to combat money-laundering in Congress because, for those who illegally amass dollars, among other things, it is not easy, these work for themselves to make, invest, or use for something else," he said.
Migration stopped
Lopez Cervantes pointed out that also a demographic factor inherent in rising unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, particularly in the United States, has fallen." This is on the one hand due to the problems of immigration and on the other hand, because it's also there trying to work to find. "These people stay here and here looking for work, allowing unemployment to rise," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, bearing in mind the high proportion of undeclared work. This includes according to INEGI 60,38 per cent of the country people who have work, without having to pay into the social security coffers.
Get low wages to unemployment and undeclared work, the lowest in all Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Institute of social security) and the Secretaría del trabajo y Previsión social (Government Agency for work and social welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa amounted to September 5352 pesos; This is a lot less than the average General Government, which is located at 7375 pesos.
Decline of the ADI
In addition to the reduction of economic activity and rising unemployment, the strongest decline in the foreign direct investment (FDI) of the last ten years is listed in 2011. According to the Secretaría de Economía (State economic authority) the ADI from January was 630 597 dollars, to June which corresponds to a loss of 87,74 per cent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period in the previous year.
In turn, the Secretaría de Desarrollo Economico del Gobierno (Government Agency for economic development) recorded a total investment amounting to 17 280 000 pesos in the year 2011, which comes above all from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
Given the economic crisis, the Government requested a loan in the amount of 3 000 000 000 pesos, which should be invested to the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in 18 communities in July at the National Congress. The provincial Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive effect of debt on some of the industries have been detected until November in the country.
Reactions
For the representatives of the business community the first year Mario Lopez made obvious Valdés Government disability.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of industry in Mexico) represented, that no efforts have been made to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the Government, in 2011.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year." It must be worked hard to regain the ground lost in this year and 2012 we must strive twice. "The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well harmonised a Government team have been matched not sufficient", he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo Lopez said that the economic development of the country's complicated events, such as the Frost at the beginning of and slowed.
"The low economic flow is the result of multiple events, including of frost." One of the main effects is a slowed economy, which is not sufficiently in motion to produce an economic dynamism that could produce a decent flow of processes, products and services. "That is why we will close the year far below our expectations", he said.
Redefine appeal
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederación patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexico's trade association) in Sinaloa stated that one must cause the State to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general we have seen, that worked." "We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to the redefinition of the economic appeal and line of the country, because it is important to enable all the material and human resources of Sinaloas," he said.
There is much to be done
Chairman of Coparmex stressed how important it is to develop a perspective that directs the efforts of the Government in better ways.
"In general I would say that the Government in various fields has achieved good results." "The economy has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He stressed that the current Government had made progress with the Government.
"There are areas in terms of it can be said that the Government has acted more broadly." "What I can say is that was working and that the Government is aware that still a lot of work before it is", he said.

The head of the Municipal Department of social development said that, although the works are already advanced, they now hover in danger, since the State Government not has paid her to resources, exceeding 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million Peso which fell 25 per cent to the State. So far only the Federación and the community to the construction work would have funds contributed, why a delay of the completion is expected.
"12 Million must do it, and though the year to end, they gave us a penny, and that, although they have a us already in July would have to pay part", he said. "To be not too late, we have already begun with the construction of the work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the rule of Jesus Aguilar Padilla Government not fulfilled his obligations is, which is why the community at the beginning of his reign had to borrow in the amount of 7 million. This would correspond to the amount that the Central Government would need to spend.
"That had gone to us already during the last parliamentary term, because the State did not have sufficient economic resources." "Continued the programs and this year we had to raise the funds us, that the State had not applied to take part in these programs," he carried out.
Even if the State authorities for the granting of those funds are obliged, he commented that in the Ministry of administration and finance, was requested to expedite the administrative work and to pay off the outstanding amount as soon as possible.
"Nearly 12 million must do it, and though the year to end, they gave us a penny."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogue to digital signals worldwide among the main changes in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice (SCJN) Mexico pointed the constitutional claims, which were submitted by the Senate and the House of representatives against the presidential decree, and virtue of the switching needs to be brought forward from analog to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 due to missing eight votes, needed the legal challenge, back.
A minority of four Ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that the President Felipe Calderón have not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree-law with the details about the switch-over to digital terrestrial television.
With this decision, the constitutional dispute launched by the Senate in the life was rejected because he was not the required qualified majority of eight votes, so that the Court could decide on the constitutionality or the non-constitutionality of. The law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit, which has been prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, Decree-law proposed for unconstitutional to explain da for the radio and television regulations concerned the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible, which is why the decree-law would contradict the hierarchical principles and the law subject to.
For the benefit of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita voted Luna and Sánchez Cordero itself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies submitted a constitutional appeals against decree-law. After the adoption of the complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero applied Decree-Law no longer and ceased all activities to set up the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers rejected also the complaint submitted by the Chamber of deputies without doing in the debate about the project for which the Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible, to enter.
In his speech, the Prime Minister expressed to agree in the sense that the Länderregierung not with General rules shall regulate the measures that the public administration will take not with the arguments of the project.
"I don't think even that, if you would do that, the independence of the regulatory body would affect". They also recalled that the Central Government is responsible for the planning of strategic policies, such as, for example, the sector of telecommunications, for constitutional reasons, because it directs the Affairs of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes, that has taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in a better use of the radio-electric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponement of the changeover, she said is a deferring of the use of digitisation, which is a decision in the public interest, have not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and technical aspects."
These matters, stressed, "made the action of the entire system required, according to the principle of the economic management by the State, they included a group of characteristics that put the Constitution into the hands of the central State Government."
She called to mind that many countries worldwide already had carried the digital switchover, through the Government, although they had highly specialized facilities.
"One could not conclude the Government with the publication of the contested decree to interfere in the powers of the Congress because the laws adopted by the legislature would be respected," she assured.
Consideration is given to the possibility to count the ballots in Michoacán individually
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the Governor is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total 6074 still not have been counted out.
The possibility of the single count of the ballot is a reality in this year election in Michoacan, because according to the data issued by the Programa de resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the gubernatorial elections is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total 6074 still not have been counted out.
In this sense, has the President of the Consejo General del Instituto electoral de Michoacán (IEM), Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just once on 9 November last the polling place had adopted a series of regulations to harmonise the local rules with the reforms of the caucus States.
We must remember that Michoacán had adapted its political Constitution nor its electoral law, nor his law on the electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they came not in force when this round of voting. The Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the Official Gazette within the time limits provided for this purpose with the argument to have still objections.
On 9 November the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on by the local legislative submitted constitutional claim and the voice of the State representative to the constitutional reforms judged as "illegal and unlawful", because it has not the right about "choose or to insert a veto against it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained during an interview about the possibility of the single count of votes, that thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM now the option would be, that the local election administration partly or wholly could count the ballots.
So the voices contained in one or more option packages can be counted under the following conditions partly the results in the logs do not match; the Protocol on the counting of votes and-berechnung is not available aktenmäßig, there are obvious errors or amendments in the logs, or it is not owned by the Chairman of the Electoral Commission.
Also, the total counting of the completely filled out ballots can occur when there is a difference between the presumed winner and the one who is in second place, is equal to or less than one percent, provided at the start of the session an explicit request of the party or coalition Chairman before, which is the second of the above candidates.
Counting can be done in its entirety, if after the ordinary calculation determined that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, assuming it is available an express request by a representative of the party, whose Kandidat has become second. In this case, the choice of packages would be a partial count suspended, excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections are in Morelia in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place is just 0.16 percent, although the voices of 129 total 923 option logs still not have been counted out.

On Wednesday the new Italian Government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, tomorrow meets with the President of Italy, to present the new Government this, which is to confront the crisis, which has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, tomorrow meets with the President of Italy, to present the new Government this, which is to confront the crisis, which has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A message from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti on Sunday appointed would meet on Wednesday with the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm the formation of the Government.
It is assumed that he will present a Cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take up his post.
Monti said he would present the results of talks with political parties to form the President.
"I would like to reiterate my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told the journalists.
Monti confirmed the formation of the Government not explicitly, but from his comments, it is clear that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "Framework is now well defined," he added.
Monti has managed in less than three days to form a Government, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile Italy fights against a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt amounting to an unbearable.
The new Government led by the former Commissioner Monti must adopt a tough austerity package, which was required by the euro politicians to regain confidence-stopped in Italy.
The pressure to rush, which weighs on Monti, intensified by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which the Italian Government bonds for 10 years with 7 percent interest were charged. This corresponds to the State, where Greece and Ireland are forced saw, to apply for the European recovery screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of Confindustria, the Italian industry grouping told the press after a meeting with Monti with: "We said we would support all efforts of this Government."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy comes out of this emergency situation.
The chances of success of Monti's were significantly enlarged by the support of the Party of PDL, Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti that are intended to bring about good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party, is essential because until now many of its members have opposed a majority consisting of technocrats Government, which just makes Monti.
Support of the Parliament
The new Government, from Monti requires a strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or slow down the reforms could again cause a devastating attack of the financial markets.
The Italian Association of foreign banks exercise with his note, Monti's failure a disaster, also pressure was off.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, unions and associations, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
Dienstagabend, the session round to be completed.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano this Sunday, has set an extremely fast change of Government in motion in response to the crisis.
After recently breathing towards the end of last week, it became known that Berlusconi would resign, as the cost of the Italian Government bonds have reached as a result of uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister again critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a public debt in the amount of EUR 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said his Government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that the politicians only time to implement the reforms will give him, instead the options preferable.
Monti said, he would like to record politicians in his Cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in the light of the proceedings imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and the disagreements between the games make complicated the involvement of persons from political life.

For your Costa Rican fans a dream realised, when Pearl Jam in Costa Rica plays: are you aware of you, what does this mean for your fans?
A dream that is carried out for us is to play in Costa Rica.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I have only once been to on vacation in Costa Rica. It is a so wonderful country that we will stay there for even a few days.
For us, it is exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you that because the fans of the band are completely revealed. Intensely enjoy the days before the concert.
What does it say your begeistertesten fans?
Thank you to stand all these years on our site.
It took us almost 21 years, until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you to have waited so long and sorry to have used, until we came here so long us.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Exert that not a bit pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we have pointed out in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We have played on a few big shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that that have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we have a desire to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle. For this, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How have their Costa Rica and its waves to surf learn about?
Many of our friends are surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply inconceivable.
My friends went to surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Along with Mexico are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, about people who love surfing, we learned them.
With a view of the tour, you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Because we there have never played, we set no limitations.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and our fans offer a good and varied repertoire.
You are never reviewed your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is partly so because we have nine panels, and you can play over 120 songs. An other song like everyone, so that the decision which we will each play, is not easy.
If we take two or three songs that we no longer have been playing in the repertoire, we can maintain better our concentration and they surprise us because they call the reasons to remind us why these songs have liked us. Otherwise, they could get into oblivion.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrating your twentieth story.
If you look back, is it hard to believe you on your success?
Yes, totally.
First of all, I, that nobody has imagined by us once a great rock band to play in, and believe even over 20 years. That seems like a dream.

We like us and are excited to bring forth music.
We are lucky to be able to drive, we always wanted to visit the places of the world.
Things could not be better stand.
What it meant for you, to have actively participated in the birth of grunge?
It has been always an honor to belong to this group of great bands.
We are friends with the people of Mudhoney, Soundgarden and Alice in chains.
It is surprising and unusually abundant, if a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual, if five or ten groups at the same time come from the same city.
We are proud to be, and are honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in chains and Canada with Mudhoney and Soundgarden, we saw on their tour. We are pleased to be friends still with all of them, and it honors us to be part of this arisen Seattle sounds.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours so long remained together with same musicians.
Yes, four of us play since 21 years together and Matt (Cameron) came to us years ago. This is much more time than many bands survive alone.
First of all, I believe that we all of us lucky to be alive, and in addition, we look at each other.
We all are close friend why themselves musical way have opened, which give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. There could be no better us.
Your relationship to fame was not always easy. On the other hand you could make that thanks to your success what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way, as we have grown, has made it easier us to find a balance.
We will make sure to be not too often on tour because it is too easy this game with huge numbers of people who love your music to expire.
As long as you remember that the people because the music have come that reminds you that you need to take the music and what has called into being, not to be a famous rock star hell bent. That has interests anyway never us.
What memories do you have of your other project of mother love bone?
I believe we have written very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band that had never issued a plate until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) for three years.
We were disappointed to have needed so long. We are still always good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us, friends. When I hear a song or see photos, I think what was Andy for an incredible person and brought me to laugh as he. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football, and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show at Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, have chosen especially Eddie Vedder and the band therefore for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos by several groups and this band we liked best. Therefore, we are curious to see, what Las live can provide Robertas. Exciting, which is determined.
The text of yellow Ledbetter why changing her always when you play live?
This is a question for ED (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing comes to him.
By whom were you influenced as a bass player?
So many +
The first covered me include geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. j. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon on the bass player that I like.
How has it managed Pearl Jam alive to keep the grunge, although it no longer is a fad?
I think we all feel not very connected with the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands fall a me, which I have mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else who came up at the same time. If they are still important, I find that great because it's worth listening to this music and bands such as Mudhoney make better music than ever before.
At first, their music was dark, now it is positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album, which may have a somewhat frivolous. But there are also other songs like the end or just breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they have also something positive in itself.
Both the tears came to me, when I heard how she played ed. There are very dark songs.
I think that when you're older and something Traumatisches in your life is happening - for example if you lose a family member or a friend - which affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs that embody clearly for me.
I believe also that you can be a happy person and make still dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came for medical check-ups once again in the hospital
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to examine the muscle loss of his legs, his doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, 25 years sitting out imprisonment for violation of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including cancer of the tongue, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Member of Parliament, and his personal doctor, said on television that Fujimori three days in a Peruvian Hospital of Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas would investigated to determine the cause of his pain and the loss of muscle in the lower limbs of the body.
Aguinaga commented that he thought Fujimori could be pardoned on humanitarian grounds. Nevertheless he not wanted this, because he considers him innocent.
He was operated on four times on tongue cancer and he has lost 18 kilos weight. To get more diseases such as a severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in his legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori is since September 2007 in prison Dirección Nacional de operaciones Especiales de la Policía.
In April 2009 he was sentenced prison for the murder of 25 people that while his reign was secretly engaged, to 25 years by the death squad of the Peruvian army.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation led by the Uruguayan President Jose Mujica and consisting of several Ministers and the entrepreneur starts their visit by Mexico on Tuesday, to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region
Mujica meets next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón. This will be the highlight of his booked your schedule with politicians, business people, and a meeting with the collective of the Uruguayan living in Mexico according to the Uruguayan President.
The meeting of two Presidents in the city of Guadalajara "suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the Office of President of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica search support Calderón's in terms of the incident with France, as the French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy at the Summit of the G20 in the French town of Cannes the South American country on a list of tax havens continued.
In his discourse Sarkozy threatened those countries that still as tax havens, to exclude from the international community. This Declaration was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request from his Ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has the Presidency of the G20, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and industrialised countries of the world since November. Since January of this year, an agreement on the exchange of tax information in order to avoid the double tax is with the South American country.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to accelerate the realisation of agreements for the exchange of tax information to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD). On it are countries, not all have introduced international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At the business level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries existed since 2004.
The schnurrbärtige Installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has 25 years tirelessly to save the Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser fought, but until now never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he fights for the love of girls in stereo technology.
The game that comes this month on the shop counters of all over the world, was from the outset tailored to the properties of the portable console Nintende 3ds, which without special glasses 3D can be played.
"Mario is the character who must say how works the stereoscopy without glasses", the person responsible for the press specialized on Nintendo in Spain at the launch of the video game in Madrid assured Omar Álvarez.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game by Nintendo, that has been developed for this console from the outset", because until now, success articles were like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adjustments to already existing title.
The Nintendo spokesman stressed that, although it is three dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game, that allow a fast, fluid game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less geschckten user.
Then can the experts about the different levels of the game, which are increasingly difficult to turn a"second round".
In addition, the users can choose between a "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action, in real time. To overcome the obstacles without becoming victims of the "optical effects" must be played but always three-dimensional.
This tour of Super Mario in the three-dimensional world means the return of the character to a portable console which has no longer been the case since 2005.
Nintendo winks to the fans of the saga with this video game and repeated the success of the previous editions: the schnurrbärtige Installer must overcome roast platforms with the dangers to free the Princess Peach.
However, the Player encounters on what's new in the movements, the environment, the panels and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillo in the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday he would the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo give place, so this is in the United States for the conspiracy to money laundering 70 million US $ am responsible for.
So ends the process on the application of the United States for the extradition of Portillo, so that this can be put on trial there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed its decision reasons on the independence of the judiciary and the Government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that he himself had interfered in court decisions during his reign and have upheld all Auslieferungsanträgen of which, he was buried in knowledge.
Except for Portillo, both because of drug trafficking, will be delivered Sergio Ruano Marroquín because of murder and aggravated assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes.
The Coloms is a Government Act, which occurs when all judicial and constitutional instances on the sentencing of former Staaatspräsidenten (2000-2004) have been exhausted.
In accordance with the decisions of the fifth of Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered, if his legal situation in Guatemala has been clarified and his human rights be guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales in the Defense Ministry during his reign. This transaction was preceded by delivery, but the Minister appealed and revived the case anew.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The Organization was created in order to avoid the marginalization of young people without training in life.
The first 25 years of the welfare organization Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion have been supported, to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition are the over one hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, balance sheet was drafted at a meeting in the former factory buildings of Fabra i coats, attended by over 300 people, yesterday.
Trinijove started 1986 in the neighbourhood Trinitat Vella with the aim in life, young people with low level of education, unemployed, with drug problems who were threatened by the risk of marginality, to help.
Yesterday's ceremony in Sant Andreu numerous managers and institutions took part, which have cooperated in these 25 years with the Club.
The participation of political representatives in different directions to election campaigns took the impartiality of Trinijove work.
Except for the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the autonomous region of Catalonia), Artur MAS, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and the former Mayor and then left-Green City Council Ricard Goma took part in the celebrations.
The current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the social services network of the savings bank la Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa visited the great Hall of Fabra i coats.
MAS stressed that Trinijove was called in very difficult times in life and that the today's times are not less complicated. But he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in trouble.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the Association and the work that he does," he said.
Occupied House, where Riesenparties were held, was granted
The homeowner had occupied 11 of 13 apartments in the building at the street of Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 squatters left yesterday afternoon without resistance to have made the building.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the House No. 51 on the streets of Balmes have come to an end.
Twelve people yesterday noon voluntarily left the building, illegally occupied they held and in which they had organized huge feasts, had driven the neighborhood to despair. The evacuation was carried out on judicial order without without police intervention.
The door lock was replaced after the RAID, to avoid a similar situation.
"Now the access be controlled", confirmed the information.
The squatters that 11 of the 13 apartments of the building had - occupied the rest were inhabited - took with the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. In addition, they had painted the walls and all kinds of garbage left behind, particularly cans with alcoholic drinks.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, lasted for up to two days and drove the tenant to despair.
A nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damage is located next to the building.
Their owner, Europe press, that their business would be dropped since the beginning of the squatting 80% said Maria Pantinat.
The owner of the nightclub pointed out that the squatters made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while it cost 10 euros in the nightclub.
Also the owner of leisure premises from the neighbors due to disturbing the peace was been displayed while according to their the noise was produced not by visitors to the disco, but by the squatters, and in particular by the guests of the festivals of that were organized, and that according to the disgruntled neighbors in the past weeks more and longer were.
The responsible officer of the nightclub, said that the harassment was so great, that they match to the owner of the building came to have to pay no rent for the last nine months.
Also, the Guardia Urbana (the municipal police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints in recent weeks by its neighbours.
The Chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - people's Party) in the City Council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, asked last week, to leave the building immediately and to get the problems of civil coexistence and the coming down of the neighborhood in the handle.
He said that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that the squatters were penetrated in recent months in all floors of the building and almost all apartments. In some, it came even to theft.
In this sense, he added that "it was necessary to put an end to impunity and to crack down against the antisocial acts in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the NOU Barris district of the Catalan police was granted.
At 3.30 pm the police approached the street Montral No. 35, after she had received a call from a neighbor, had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects are apart from the disputes about fees with the tender agree.
The urban call for proposals of the 16 goals opened the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona again.
Mid-1980s, at the height of the now vanished Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this Administration published its libel on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was compared even to numbers with Central Park of New York.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987 in the eyes of many was again to the ceiling of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia is one (mountain range) and down the few who is spreading in North South direction but upwards (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
As an example, the Central Park, but Yellowstone no longer served with feral pigs in the role of want bärs.
It was as far as the city spent a huge tender, consisting of 16 contests for more access gates to Collserola in September.
No doubt a goal refers to the concept of a park.
Is it so or someone intends to ask gates to the country.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The tender is the topic of conversation in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona not only from organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city.
It's almost a rekurrentes theme, two members of this old-established caste, who meet in the elevator, can access the back.
And exactly this fact provides the fabric for one of the rare matches between the three architects from Barcelona about thinking, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldan "it is necessary" to speak, after the attack on the coast of the "front of the mountains" as far as the discourse by Ildefons Cerdà, who about the Green apples, not held has been.
"It should be the principle, that Barcelona's biggest Park is the beach."
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
"Collserola is complex," says the architect, for the title of "Gates of Collserola" carries a "lexical trap" in itself: man should they not "as access to a park imagine, rather than containment of areas on which we must act."
Modol, such as Roldan and Bayona with urban experience, considered an "intellectual challenge" that is "some hazards" in the proposal.
Driven as a result of the "insecurity, which nowadays entails the design of public space" after the experience of the 1980s, which had her "Swan Song" in the section of the Forum.
The first fear is their own limit on what can be built on.
"Something to restrict means always, to set the next step", i.e. to him exceed.
"We must consider new urban planning instruments, because the present [referring to the plan of General Metropolitano (PGM)] may lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is close to the question thinks the page of Collserola, which goes in the direction of Vallesana, simplified, "can in direction Barcelona not a park be understood as," for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there already are a study of the patronage de Collserola, not "should launch on deaf ears", although he was grateful to the City Council that she gave the possibility of his body, on this project "from the first moment" to participate.
In addition, he noted that the proximity of the mountains to the city is the document that allows the architects to take part in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt", whether this technical profile the multidisciplinary teams launched ("just right", he says) should guide "We should be just a tool architects."
Bayona seems to indicate that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, because in the tender conditions, a global view of Collserola lacking: "It 16 contests in cross-section were advertised", he says, "on the axis of mountain sea." "But there are no longitudinal perspective that considers the territory in its entirety."
This has led at least in his case that he participates in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a goal with the architect of the gate in addition would collide.
His opinion the city should guarantee absolutely that the Strip directly over the Ronda de Dalt is equipped in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between city and green areas.
Casino Awards Jonas Larrazabal, which comes free
After 72 days silence liberated the agents of Casino red the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey by the process, running against him for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonas Larrazabal is released after 72 days of captivity, after the agents of Casino red him before the second Criminal Court of the district, which has awarded the process against the brother blackmail leads the Mayor of Monterrey because.
After the assassination of the Casino Royale released Sergio Gil Garcia, the owner of the Casino red, a series of photos and videos, where Manuel Jonas is seen, allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money, so that the City Council approved the secret operation of the betting house.
According to the criminal complaint, the public prosecutor's Office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the Mayor of panistischen, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the officials of the Ministerio Público 3 it en Delitos Patrimoniales he was brought the capital in the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público had discarded the offences because of corruption and organised crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the detention centre of Cadereyta, because he presumed to be the owner of the Casino red with one and a half million pesos had bribed. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the central security wing because of death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to the court case as an inmate of the urban prison of San Nicolas de los Garza to take part.
On October 25 he was the Secretary of the second Criminal Court of the district, Jorge Yáñez, delivered to a prison regulation. He noted that after the nearly two-month investigation would sufficient evidence be made, guilty to speak Jonas for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house, to open this in return.
This Monday asked the agents of Casino red, Victor Aldo García Gómez the judge José Luis Pecina, the brother of the Mayor the punishment to adopt, which is why it is used in the next few hours free.
During the judicial hearing officials of associated with the Court of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, Ramiro Arias, asked whether these have fixed the damage and which the owner of the betting House have pronounced his forgiveness. The lawyer held back the name however.
Jonas Larrazabal is acquitted according to case 197 / 2011. Also the following no objections against the process may be lodged, in addition, no compensation is required.
After the hearing of representative of the betting House against 15,50 H, Larrazabal Breton was immediately released on.
The legal Secretary, Jorge Yáñez, drove to the municipal jail of San Nicolas de los Garza, Jonas to tell that he was acquitted, and his case files would be put.
He informed him about the judicial order to secure the immediate release.
The Secretary Dionisio Perez Jacome announces details of the aircraft accident, in which the Government Secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat of communications and transportation in Mexico) informed that the findings of the accident in which were the Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people killed, pointing out that the helicopter with his whole intact structure directly against the ground is bounced without that the pilot would have to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jacome, Secretary of communications and transport, mentioned that the pilot before the start would have confirmed, the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"The fact that contact with trees had the propeller blades 25 M above sea level, where the helicopter lost the body, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter for 19 passengers was built which is why he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the field, on which the machine was run down.
"Find no aircraft parts at other locations were found, the surcharge covered the entire structure."
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he fulfilled all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area is in a skew from 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but it could take several months, maybe even a year.
In turn assured Gilberto López Meyer, Managing Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretary for aircraft and emergency services in Mexico) that was flown in the helicopter by the Estado Mayor Presidencial at impact with cruising speed and the aircraft on a soft slope fallen.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was at the time of impact a normal flight operation."
At a press conference the Director listed the SCT, Perez Jacome, six relevant points should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual:
In accordance with the standards of the flight there was a flight according to the rules of Sichtflugs. This means that the crew would have had sufficient view in-flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The JUÁREZ recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the Weiterflugs in the direction of the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, some deep hanging clouds moved on.
Selected routes:
It is possible that the team due to the clouds had selected a lower area with a better view in the direction of the Cuernavaca Valley.
Point of impact:
Match the impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter. May be it has before impact neither a loss of control of the aircraft still a deviation from the flight path given.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicate that the helicopter from the straight and lateral direction was bounced.
The pattern of the scattered remains of the aircraft indicate that the helicopter was bounced with its intact structure on the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
Offer the remains of the aircraft at the accident site indicate neither fire nor explosion.
The recent findings point to several ground contacts.
Investigations on the ground, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is gentle and has a skew of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence where the helicopter is probably gone to break.
Some information indicate that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search on an area that went beyond the fenced-off area at the accident site, no scattered parts of the aircraft could be found, what the adoption of strengthened, that the intact aircraft structure against the ground was bounced.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
She heads a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by specialists of IPN Mexico's Social Security Institute.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Security Administration) announced that it leads a research project to the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence", are to be used to found the genetic marker related to obesity.
Miguel Cruz Lopez, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquimica (Department of medical research, focus on biochemistry) at the clinic hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of built from doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the post graduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sport facilities of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8: 00 A.m. tests are performed with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the West of the State of Mexico) started and will continue since 8 October on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the East of the State of Mexico).
If the goal of 500 to 600 is reached investigation personnel, the study on the sports field of Independencia (in the South of the capital district) is continued and of Morelos (in the North of the capital district) completed on the.
He stated that the purpose of the study was getting to know the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and youth for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of world day of diabetes said he will aim that three thousand children and young people aged from six to 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents should fill out food-related questionnaires.
Also questions them about their physical activity and their familial history of the disease, to control risk factors which might cause diabetes or renal failure.
He carried out also that on these Saturdays the examination persons measured (weight, size, waist size), controlled their blood pressure and blood values, such as the level of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (try the identification of genes associated with obesity in childhood) determines would.
Cruz Lopez emphasized that this study be carried out on the occasion of the concern of health workers about the alarming weight gain in young people.
"The health interview surveys showed from 1999 and 2006 that the proportion of obese boys by 77 percent and the the girl with obesity by 47 percent have increased in almost six years." "Also the obesity has increased dramatically", the specialist of the IMSS is stressed.
He indicated that the search for genetic markers is justified, because the genetic history of the population of Mexico is differences of other peoples.
He stated that a (e) Mexican (in) on average 65 percent Indian American, European and 5% African American is 30%, which reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity related.
In General, he said the genetics of obesity expresses in the inability to burn the excess of energy (calories) taken to us, so that this will be stored in the form of fat.
The researchers said immediate benefits for participants in the investigation would be a comprehensive survey of children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would studied even the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and on the inner arm (Acanthosis) that indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage.
All the information would be confidential and notified the parents in writing by doctors. The doctors tell parents all measurement results and suggest lifestyle changes them that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz Lopez stated that there were three basic factors which are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that means missing movement in everyday life, to spend most of the day watching TV and using means of transport, to go instead of short distances on foot.
High calorie intake, that is to say, an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high-fat and protein, and genetics, which should be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt of the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM developed modified Asphalte with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature changes
Would the attention on the characters that emanate from the road surface, it would be unnecessary to repair nearly 200 000 potholes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana erupts del Valle de México (part of Mexico Valley), said Rafael Herrera Najera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured, that when laying out and maintenance of asphalt covering adequately happen, the number of potholes are significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Potholes from a technical perspective" which he delivered on the occasion of the international year of chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, develop modified Asphalte with polymers, to establish a mix similar to the asphalt that, however, has a greater mechanical resistance at high as well as at low temperatures.
Herrera Najera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate, as for example, in some cities in the North of the country, should be used to improve the behavior of pavements and thus avoiding the appearance of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon of the part of a high molecular weight has - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part of a low - the so-called Malthene. Together, they impart the road surface its characteristic visco-elastic behavior.
Tough-elastic behavior of asphalt means that it behaves at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C like a liquid, at 120 ° C it is very viscous and almost fixed at 50 ° C, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
The chemical engineer carried out "Which means that the resistance of asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but depending on the weather conditions and temperature changes in a day,".
The researchers of the FQ noticed the streets of Mexico City have a flexible road surface, which are drawn from six layers of material, of which the last three asphalt included majority.
A wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small, bathed in asphalt and then paved stones lie between the top layers.
Each individual stones this wearing course had been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move out and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better", said the chemical engineer.
"About the wear layer", he carried out "A last layer is designed, the so-called base layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. made of sand, which was bathed in asphalt."
Because this layer in contact with the tyres, they need a higher mechanical strength than the wear layer, and she must make friction.
That this road surface receives the most forces and distributed, the base layer also requires an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made, must be maintained are.
"Weather conditions, especially humidity, and temperature fluctuations, are more important to consider factors, above all the water," said he, "because it substantially affect the behavior of the wearing course."
If the terrain is humid, water penetrates into the layer and comes out just trying again. This causes a softening of all layers of pavements and as a result the appearance of potholes.
"If a pothole", he said, "The surface is worn off first, while the wear layer is affected then." "But the damage occurs immediately, but is a process that should be maintained at the first sign by appropriate maintenance programmes."
The Member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (national research system Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of pavements always in relation to the vehicle load must be, and it must be ensured that to avoid by frequent potholes this rule is respected.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research wait could, for example, of asphalt emulsions, which are in other countries already on the market, and that repair the potholes easily and without applying high temperatures did.
What lacked del Valle of the candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that is worked out that Melina Ramirez Serna not got the Crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14 missions title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went up empty in the granting of the Crown for Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to be satisfied that, to stand to make a silver Crown and the band, that indicates that it as new Miss Colombia, on the winners podium.
This night received resulting in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico took the Crown and the Cedar itself, the Department already on 14 mission title comes and Melina joins the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which had kept the Crown almost in the hands. The proclaimed misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question facing many today, is: what was missing?
Because the result is the decline of a great favourite, which had shown that she had everything, to be the new Miss Colombia at every screening. Not for nothing she had been elected to the Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles, who received also the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the Crown of Miss Colombia with home.
The first factor is as crucial for the decision of the jury, to appoint them, the first Miss is that they the answer to the question "What book you most strongly influenced and why?", which was been put by Martin Murillo Gomez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos, had not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the honourable Member:
"I read a lot, I believe pretty much in the literature, I think, it's a way to civilize themselves, ultimately I think that the book that most influenced my childhood, ' Der kleine Prinz" is a very deep depth book. "
Currently, I read 'Crime and punishment'. It is a book of universal culture which we all should read. I read just a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that is 'Passions'.
A response that met with little favour, firstly 'civilize themselves because of the term' and secondly, because it had not specifically stated how each book mentioned by her had influenced them.
But after the ceremony Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "the universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done."
And for all the people: read please a bit ' the little Prince '. It is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that in advance all prices had gotten the fact that she was the preferred, which boasts all the Beifälle and the (gastronomy competition Oster, public vote on the best ink tailor-made costume and Reina Madre), "The other candidates jealous had made, what stresste the Queen could not therefore shining on stage."
And we realized that at its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she certainly appeared on both, but the strength and the impetus which the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico were on display was her.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition, eventually but not Queen".
Also, Valle went to the end of the press out of the way - a mistake.
A further theory is that Valle could convince the Jurie regarding their interest in social work, what ultimately is the essence of national beauty contest.
It will have his reason, that two days before the collection of the international jury of Lucy Doughty said they searched for a woman who is committed to the Social Affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone not sufficient for a Miss Colombia." "One must look beyond the physical and concentrate on the social feeling, sure that she had worked with before taking part in the competition on projects," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with its defects of the Derrière and the fibrosis, you noted it in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose it as candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits, and good physical work.
The coach of the Queens, Jorge Hernan Orozco, admits that Melina was not the best body that there is better, "but their problem with the fibrosis on the belly for me frankly hard to notice it was pushed their score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos by the magazine of Cromos of view is, the surgical interference, where she had undergone had been the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca.
"The operations are ok, but Valle did not know how she it right should be."
"Her body has never been their strong side, and she had to pay this point."
Due to this award, first awarded by the national beauty contest, a cruel prediction that should be true in the night was built after the appearance in a bathing suit. There was rumour that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize, they come in the the Crown to make.
No matter, whether that's true or not, the fact is that Melina is from today the year of her rule, although not as a Queen, but as a Princess, on appointment of national beauty contest of Colombia at one of the international competitions to represent a position that offers her the opportunity.
However, she will go down as one of the Queens, despite their overwhelming presence for Cartagena, the Crown had escaped in the history.
So was the work of the physician who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoskopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
These officials work plays a key role.
On November 4 a Lophoskopist of investigation unit of the public prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - revolutionary armed forces of Colombia), entered into: "Alfonso Cano" through comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the Department of CTI, Eliazar Gonzalez had on call, a man from Puerto Tejada, who works with 21 years with criminal investigation this week.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in communities of Chocó, where he often five days had to go into the jungle, to reach the place, where the bodies were, that he should identify.
2000 he relocated to Valle and after the completion of the required courses he specialized in Lophoskopie, which is the study of the skin, which is exposed to friction, i.e. of the palms and soles.
In the week of the use against the so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar was pointed out to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
Friday night, he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that suspicion was that one could be that of the man of who had initiated the oldest guerrilla of the world. That is why he should take the ten-finger print page by Guillermo Leon Saenz (his actual name).
But reaching the place with the Untersuchungste, where the body was, he could not identify him due to his physical appearance, because this resembled the pictures he had seen in the mass media, not in the least.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wearing no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planting trowel and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the dead body with those on the imprint page.
He had seen correctly: it was "Alfonso Cano".
Still same night this from Puerto Tejada, man that was responsible to inform the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzon, that actually was the Chief of the FARC.
On search
For a Daktyloskopen of the SIJIN in Cali was evaluating to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the fight against "Cano" which was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
The fingerprint data is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoskopisten identify not only bodies, support also investigation in murder and rape cases, and confirm the identity of the arrested person.
During their arrest, many offenders present false identification documents or they have none.
We take the fingerprints them and check them in the database.
The researchers told us that he had to tear a piece of wall of a house in a theft, because the thief had relied on precisely at this point with his hand, as he pulled out a safe crowded with jewellery and money.
"Walls are difficult, because their surfaces for fingerprinting are inappropriate." He recalled, "but in this case we take the impression of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in several robberies".
Using the fingerprint also murder suspects can be relieved or charged.
Recently one death was surrounded by brandy bottles found.
In the calculation, it has been suggested that a member of the family could be tatverdächtig, and actually agreed a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, so he is associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A Daktyloskopist of CTI declared that "the fingerprints with physical or chemical reagents of the object would be taken."
If they appear, a planting trowel or a tape is used to carry.
Then the prints on the Asif will be sent, which is the criminal database, or to the personal level Office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification documents," said the expert of the CTI.
He said that not everything is so as it would shown in the TV series SCI.
As not all the gold is what shines, is also not everything that it touches a fingerprint.
But nevertheless it can be used when one performs a relevant comparison.
"Empörten" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed together in tents on the Zuccotti course.
Most came the possession order after and moved its location in a nearby park.
The members of the movement of Ocupy challenged the authorities of New York City's Wall Street this Tuesday, as they with a court order once again tried to enter the Manhattan place after dawn from the square had been granted and had tried to occupy a different place in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters pushed down before the Zuccotti place together, to which she herself with a court order that allowed "The Empörten the new tents at this point", wanted to gain access. Meanwhile, continued the other part of the movement to the possession order and occupied a park further north in the city, where it resulted in nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the Court does not allow us to camp on the course we find ourselves together at another location and continue the battle with legal means to return to the Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray carried out that the answer of the "outraged" on the evacuation of their Zeltlagers, ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor of New York came up before the Court, where the judge Lucy Billings gave an order which prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and approved the tents of the demonstrators.
In addition, they occupied a new Park, which is at the crossroads of Central Canal Street and the sixth connects Avenue very near to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, the New York and New Jersey, is, and is the property of Trinity Church "Outraged".
You could occupy the place at least one hour. But then the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray can give no exact numbers. He assured the news agency EFE that he had seen several journalists with handcuffs including.
The Organization assured that it would have to hundreds of people at this point sit down, which arrived also a delegation of religious leaders as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and to communicate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti place (a campus in private ownership) will remain closed pending a judicial hearing, which is scheduled for this Tuesday, and where the legality of the RAID taken place at dawn to be parsed.
Some of the protesters driven from the square wore photocopies of this court order to himself and to be distributed. They gave them even some policemen who guarded the place what had "some small clashes" resulted, as Bray reported, had displayed some police had beaten demonstrators.
The judicial statement prohibits the authorities to allow members of occupy Wall Street from the square, and the use of "laws, which were adopted after the occupation and to ban the demonstrators with their tents and other things that they had used before, to return to the Park."
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that the re-opening of the place for the public and the demonstrators had been lifted due to this court order. The demonstrators he pointed out that the laws of the city not allowed them to focus again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The Mayor personally defended the eviction carried out at dawn of the Zuccotti square, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and that it was decided because the demonstrators "violated the law."
Bloomberg said he would have given the order to the evacuation of the place, because it "had turned into a place, to which the people came not to demonstrate, but to the breaking of laws and in some cases cause damage to other people", because "Some stores have received threats" and local residents FRG for "to their quality of life".
"The clearing at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is interested in basically to protect of financial interests and not to protect of the interests of North American workers," added the spokesman of the movement which anschuldigte the Mayor "freedom of the press not to respect".
The leaders of "occupy Wall Street" informed that they thought to it, to organise "big promotions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months which now take the protests since the September 17,.

The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson occur on December 1 in the TV program "it's a Russell Peters Christmas" along with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities and breathing life into a very special lady.

Japan is reborn after the earthquake
The GDP is growing at 1.5% thanks to the consumption of domestic and stopped the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed that was still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake, which culminated in a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster, the Japan 2 had experienced during World War II.
The first estimates of the Government in Tokyo evaluated the damage at 300 000 $, a blow that seems to be despite the difficult global economic situation, to weaken.
After three quarters lasting if the information to the gross domestic product from July to September to finally close this chapter were: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the quota that is extrapolated to the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan begins the fiscal year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained partly by the sale of machine for the rebuilding of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% as compared to the decrease of 0.9% for investments, which were recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual reversal of the Japanese economy not only from keynsianischen impulses that take advantage of the crisis to build infrastructure or to build is based.
Japan is woken up in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable is increased by 1%, pushed by the growing spending on cars, travel and leisure.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted to the domestic market, after the yen - the Japanese currency - resting in one of the "refuge currencies" of investors, who are fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the gloomy forecasts for the US, a privilege, the as a gravestone on the accounts of the exporters.
With a harder currency, the products more expensive abroad are a serious problem for a country whose Wirtschaft is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While the markets continue besieged peripheral EU countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
"You must respect the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen on the continuing risks, for example, on the deterioration of some foreign economies,", the State Secretary for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
The prospects are really not very aufheiternd.
The Organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD) said that most Member States had assigned clearer signs of a slowdown of the economy in September.
The indicator, which preceded the turning points of the global economy, brought to light that the brakes would be considered in the largest economic powers.
Because he dropped four tenths up on los 100.4 points compared to the 100,8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which stands at 100, after she has dropped points to eight tenths to 99.13.
Athens casts again doubt
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums driven in the height of the peripheral countries and be broadly continued uncertainty, Greece continue lost in the labyrinth that creators of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek Government is a response to pressure from Brussels rather than a genuine belief of political forces, is slowly consumed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday, that there is no alternative to the reforms and that the hundred days agreed to his appointment were perhaps too short for their implementation, the leader assured Nueva Democracia, Antonis of Samaras, that he support the new austerity measures and by no means its call new elections to the conservative party intended date, 19 February, will take back.
Papadimos assured "The most important task of this Government is implementing the decisions taken at the Summit of 26 October," yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will reach its climax tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new Government.
The first initiatives are a package of 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion.
Nevertheless Samaras communication gives insufficient doubts about his attitude: "we have to support the Transitional Government promise, but otherwise nothing."
The Conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8000 million, which badly needs Athens. He made it clear that he would approve no commitment on compliance with the cost-cutting measures.
But the European Commission, that referendum is still irritated because of the effects of poker play with Papandreu, reaffirmed yesterday again, their request was not to shake: the economic aid would not be signed, if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "a clear written agreement as soon as possible" would sign.
The spokesman of the Ministry of economy, Amadeu is, explained that the inspectors of the troika "very soon" come back to Athens, to discuss "what for the payment of the sixth section" needed was"of 8000 million euro" Although there is still no final date with the new Government.
The Greek skein has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "instruments of progress and hope are the"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" role of Spain in this type of financing
Spain "has world's a dominant role in the role of Kleinstfinanzierungen reached".
The Queen Sofia of Spain yesterday reminded that Spain worldwide have become in the last two decades the second donor for this means to international cooperation. Its "essence" is based on it, that it was an 'instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for humanity as a whole on the basis of trust in human beings'.
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth World Summit on microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely essential" to reach up to the year 2015 Millennium objectives by the United Nations and "In particular the objective, the number of persons, which must, live with income of less than a dollar a day so below the"poverty line"."
Spain "continue working" on the expansion of Begünstigtennetzes "in the last corner of the world and it this task performs responsibly", noticed the Queen Sofia, which hopes that the initiatives and contributions, which are emanating from the Summit that lasts until Thursday, "creating new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest, and in particular for women" as the main beneficiary of these loans are guaranteed.
"We have seen many successes" and "face many challenges."
The Summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform to kick-off "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen stated that it will strive that up against the end of the year 2015, 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households will rise above the poverty line.
The concept of microcredit goes back in Spain and the rest of the world on the by Muhammad Yunus "Way initiated years ago", which assesses the Queen Sofia as an "Act of Justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as an "admirable idealists, who have committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work they 15 years know, the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to meet the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience of the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in Ivory Coast followed a year later in 1999 and Canada in 2006. All have "we continuous further development watch can", said the Queen, whose Engagement yesterday introduced the assessment as "Head of the family" her in Valladolid and as an "Advocate of the poor" for this project.
Finally, the Queen Sofia ended her talk by she animated the audience to take part in the debate and to search for solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez pointed out that solidarity is an "ethical imperative" for the entire democratic State.
In this sense she stressed that it is a mistake to link development aid in times of economic boom because there had been a "lasting commitment".
Jimenez was of the opinion that the micro-credit is a "Serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty was", and that the Governments of the industrialized countries would have to work now "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and not likely to admit that the solidarity of the crisis the victim falls.
For Spain, the micro-credit are one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for international cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, beklatschte "success", "marginalized" people to give "you will always be closed doors" "Hope" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city, that open "Their doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of General voting
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, the November 14 in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulty.)
The future of Europe was originally not in the program, but has prevailed in the autumn, to provide enough especially to those activists who today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax appreciate the Government policy with regard to the Greeks.
The presidential resolution proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
However, only nine had voted among 1001 delegates, ten had abstain.
The several minutes lasting standing ovation that initially, Angela Merkel, as well as a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble were as a result of their intervention orders, trial on the part of the three Europe inclined to Finance Minister no doubt open.
The main idea of the Chancellor has - as well as the request - following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "Nine million jobs directly from the euro are dependent on".
The Chancellor is "the time for a breakthrough in Europe come for".
This could be expressed by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty with regard to the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, bestärkende the control of the European Union; ""as this could result but in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of General voting", to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the application proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble stood Godfather.
Surely, it is hardly likely that the 47 agree quickly on this revolution: Groβ Britain is opposed faces the thing, and the Chief of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy of the same opinion.
The milestone is however.
As well, the delegates in an overwhelming majority have rejected the proposal of the weighting of each country on the ECB Executive Board according to the weight of the individual economies which obviously would be a strengthening of the position of Germany.
The Chancellor roofed to calm the climate within their party has reinforced thus the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. She no longer tried their Congress at the expense of the "small" or the difficulties all European countries to win, which would immediately condemn the arrogant Germany.
As far as the Europe application dedicated to a paragraph of the significance of "German French friendship", Angela gets Merkel France not on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this recalls that Leipzig faced two centuries at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact one of the extremely humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What represents the fraud in sickness?
After the family allowances, UMP and Government now take the sickness in attack.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive on Tuesday, the November 15 in Bordeaux to consult a family aid Fund and to present a talk on the - since 2007 recurring - theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the State.
To accompany this attack, which originates from an effort to take the economy in a sample of hardness, on the other hand however no less Harbinger an axis of the right presidential campaign represents, wants the majority focus on employee ill message.
First of all with budget-economic objectives: the Government aims at the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before taking into account a notification for workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a diseased workers without approval of the specific company would lose the reward of four days, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that according to the daily "Les Echos" anger threatens to provoke, but would help to introduce EUR 280 million.
And which would go hand in hand with a different measure of rather symbolic character: the State officials a unvergüteten Karenztag in case of illness to grant (so far there are for them, in the Gegensatze to the three Karenztagen in the private sector, no waiting period).
While these questions in the discussion are available, the majority of new reignited the fraud issue, which this time is targeted at abuse associated with work absence.
"Checks will be far more important, and in addition they are to pay back, when it is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday that the November 13 before the microphone of the broadcaster RTL.
The impact of this message in terms of the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of sickness a little disproportionate seem as also in other cases.
This is subject to permanent monitoring, as well as political offensives that have most frequently borne fruit in fact since 2002.
The French are no longer frequent sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
Stay but first in the nationwide figures.
According to the national health insurance by CNAM, more than 237 million euros daily payments were disbursed in 2006.
Pursuant of the institutes and documentation Institute of health presented the daily payments in 2008 with €11.3 billion 5% of health spending.
Under this amount fell 46% regarding maternity leave and work-related accidents and 54% on disease breaks, which is 6.2 billion euro.
And thus 2.5% of health care expenditure.
In 2010 were the French against the 17.8 days in 2009 according to a study of Alma Consulting Group on average only 14.5 sick days allowed.
An average value which glossed over some differences: another, was published in 2007 by Monster.com, career planning, site, revealed that 75% of the 40 000 stated surveyed, French workers, to have taken a single sick day.
An other, covered by health insurance, this time study makes it clear that 37% of sickness were in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11%.
French workers tend no longer than elsewhere compared to their European neighbours to incapacity for work.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the French National Centre for scientific research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global rate of absences (disease or otherwise justified) reciprocated, at France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sickness represents a vanishingly small proportion with regard to undeclared work.
Here only a weak dimensions is achieved with regard to fraud.
The reinforcement of legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatische controls on sickness, exceeding 45 days.
"" In 2008, the CNAM (public high school for education and training of technicians and engineers) established under 1.5 million checks that 13% of the 285,000 of realised, short-term sickness, which were heiβt in 37.050 cases ", unjustified or too long".
The systematically controlled ill message cases more than 45 days, there were duration under 1.2 million 11% on "maladaptive or unjustified" cases, that is 132,000.
Overall, this makes so 169,000 "unjustified" cases on several million workers who have claimed a notification.
A digit that represents only a weak dimensions compared to, for example, those of undeclared work.
According to the UMP deputies Dominique Tian, author of a case report published in July with regard to this issue, between 9 and 15 billion Euro tax profit loss per year constitutes, i.e. more than the cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the Defraudation in the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece have a new adjustment scheme to intercept its economy needed.
This had on Monday, the 14 November the Prime Minister Lucas of Papademos announced before Parliament by attaching the fact, that that his Government from the Union granted a hundred days not sufficient, to complete this task.
The head of Government declared "to be able to continue, to the efforts to a strengthening of the economy we need support for our European partners and a new programme budget adjustment", in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the euro Summit on 27 October is the "main purpose" of the new Government, because the participation of the country within the euro zone would be "at risk" as he added.
According to M. Papademos has planned to reduce the deficit of the country "by the 9 %" of GDP today to the end of the year after this in 2010 10.6% and was in 2009 to 15.7%.
The rights rejects the new Sparmaβnahmen
Antonis of Samaras, head of the right wing, had given its consent to the already approved measures as regards a trial serving the escape from the debt crisis on Monday, but said that that his party is not to an additional Sparmaβnahme provide explain would.
"We will vote in favour of new measures", he said during a parliamentary meeting of his party new democracy.
He had agreed with the requirements of the reduction of the budget deficit and debt, as well as to the fight against waste, faced with hostile but any policy, would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary tasks betrauter EU Commissioner, which had prevented that the IMF and the EU share the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without written guarantee of all parties on whose support the planned measures, had Antonio Samaras replied, that his word is enough and he would sign anything under pressure of Auβen.
Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalized so a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report in the Royal Society of Canada
The Panel stated that Governments, institutions of health care and doctors schmerzlindernder treatment worked together to provide the best subtle ways, and going beyond this also on the cases of the cancer.
The Canadian company lives in a rejection towards death.
Only 9% of Canadians can be adjusted fact, to talk about where they want to die with their doctor about conditions and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, the six experts were involved, which are linked together in different fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
The Panel recommends that the Government so to amend the Penal Code, to assisted suicide and to allow euthanasia, where it turns this election, and in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent company of EIU had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of Erdballes to each other.
Although Canada this has placed rank on the 10th, the study notes that "the medical care of death in Canada has produced a culture, where people are afraid to bring up the topic of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, so tell us the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority wish of Canadians at home to die, to die but ultimately 68.6% of these in the hospital.
Viewed from across the country made the rate 86% of deaths occurred in hospitals in the Quebec is the highest.
The authors of the report are conclusions which are opposite directions to make the position of the Federal Government, which has already geäuβert, no changes of the criminal code with regard to euthanasia and carriers commit suicide, in the thorny issue with regard to euthanasia and carriers commit suicide.
But now according to the experts, gleichermaβen have inspected all of those countries, whose Ansatz of euthanasia and assisted suicide a legalized or decriminalized there have, no evidence that such decriminalisation would bring Miβbräuche in their application, so implementing the practice of euthanasia or escort suicide by incompetent or not consenting persons to.
On the contrary, one far more cases of such violations in the countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide is not legalized, as yesterday meet Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,".
"Also accompanied suicide practiced in Canada, although this clearly illegal", Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians are in favour of euthanasia
Let us according to an Angus Reid survey carried out in the year 2010 already 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia geäuβert had themselves, as they are of the opinion that they allow to soften it persons at the end of their releases, their suffering.
And 66% believe that the facts of a legalization of euthanasia the effect has to convey that the lives of elderly or disabled people less besäβe the message.
In terms of those who have already practised an assisted suicide, respondents 41% believe that they not should be prosecuted.
As regards maintenance or adjustment of resources for patients, presents itself clearly situation as less, so the author of the report.
As well, they suggest in their recommendation that in the Penal Code should be specified, that the setting down of the means for a legally valid rejection have been, should not be considered criminal.
The Expert Panel also requires that health care in the task be trained should, to respect a weaning of funds at the end of life, and to this must fear without prosecution.
The Panel stated that Governments, institutions of health care and doctors schmerzlindernder treatment worked together, going beyond the best subtle means to provide, and this also on the cases of cancer.
Last calls for the Panel in terms of resources applied already in the Canadian institutions to health care deeply for pain relief or lebensabschlieβender measures, at least to consider them because they were as little as euthanasia used to reduce physical pain, and they refer to the same procedures.
Reservations other experts
Some experts on the area of the law of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the report unterzeichnenden experts among others as "extreme" because it set no limits the practice of euthanasia in patients in the final stages.
"This anyone who is Wesley and older than 18 years, to ask, to assist him in his suicide someone else opens the doors to a situation in which", so RA Deschamps, who yesterday had seen through a summary of the report.
RA Deschamps also emphasised the authors of the report seemed to be the responsibility of the individual over all other values which are involved in the social fabrics of society.
But now, he says there would be "Guidelines and obligations in society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist in health law, brought also a "strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report expressed that they dubbed as "Pro euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, which itself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada doubts to in particular the report details regarding the non vorliegens abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to the scope of power
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad's demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of Auβenministeriums.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bashar al Assad, but holding this forward thanks to the support of Russia and against the country-oriented "conspiracy" by itself has, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Ausschluβ of Syria by the Arab League the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighboring countries of Syria, position in favour of a Abtritts of President Assad had involved.
King Abdullah II. "Of Jordan was those reigning Arab Prime Minister who had urged President Bashar al-Assad yesterday," to lay down his Office power in Syria, where already the forty civilians and members of governmental power were killed.
"His country's interest would be Bashar at heart, so he would cede, but in addition he should create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life", as the King of Jordan, neighbour of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomatic Chief Ahmet Davutoglu had in turn complains that the targeted since the beginning of the year to the Syrian regime, Turkish mediation not of success were crowned.
"Those in the Middle East, which are not at peace with their people and not can satisfy this need to go," he explained to which Turkey takes an ever rougher expectant attitude in reference to Syria, the neighboring country.
The United States has for its part welcomed the "strengthening of consensus against Assad, as well as the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International community, United States of America, EU, Arab League and countries such as Turkey have struck a sharper always growing sound in the face of the repression in Syria", mark toner, a spokesman for the State Department observed.
During this time are 16 civilians and at least 19 members of governmental power in the region of Dar' (a) in the South of Syria come to death, the Syrian Observatory for human rights OSDH announced.
Two other citizens had come according to this NGO "Exchanges and heavy bombings to Jobar" in the besieged city of Hims killed.
At a press conference, Syrian Auβenhandelsminister Walid al-Muallim was nevertheless considers the country "control point at the end of the crisis".
He has by the way with emphasis on the decision of the Arab League, responding, of request to suspend Damascus, what constitutes a "dangerous step" to his opinion.
Syria "will not give in to", he added under the assurance, "The plot against Syria forged would fail".
After the decision on the suspension of Syria, the Arab League currently now examines a "safeguard mechanism for civilians" and wishes sending 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers in the country.
The French Auβenhandelsminister Alain Juppé had also in favour of the deployment of United Nations observers pronounced itself, to civilians before repression of the regime, that after him in his "paranoia" encapsulates to stand protectively.
An auβerplanmäβige new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat, to ensure the implementation of the plan adopted on 2 November to the Krisenaustieg, but in particular to discuss the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities, as well as the liberation of imprisoned protesters.
Sergei Lavrov, the Russian had yesterday as "incorrectly" classified, admonished to to beware before the endorsement of any sanctions against Damascus, although China Syria to the implementation of the rapid atomausstiegsgesetz plan already had has the decision of the Arab League.
Italy
Monti called on the markets to patience and Italy to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian Prime has demanded a little more time from the markets to make his staff and to implement a program, "Victims" call off to regain the credit they had lost during the last months of Berlusconi's Government.
The former Commissioner had yesterday held a negotiation with political parties before the current meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was its role to convene a Cabinet in the Parliament which relatively strictly made up of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of a major program with a number of victims", so Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller, participating in the discussions parliamentary groups, after he was met with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had in turn to be seen geäuβert, which is a vote of confidence Mario Monti the Parliament up to Friday, to verify that the new Government of sufficient support has.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation of a list of amendment presented by Mr Monti, is ranging down to the head of State Giorgio Napolitano undoubtedly of a dozen Ministers.
Mr Monti commented on yesterday's nervousness of stock exchange and Obligationsmärkte called for a time.
In "A democracy there are certain deadlines," to prepare a Government and a Government programme, he emphasized the note it taken "sure that the markets themselves will show gedulig and circumspect".
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had increased out again on it, especially after a unexpected industrial production decline in the euro area in September.
The incumbent Prime Minister should set up a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, even though he had stressed involve gladly "politician".
The new Government should be only until the year 2013, the date of the next general election, so he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new Government should get the vote of confidence of the Parliament until Friday.
Mr Monti has committed since its function, to work to make Italy the "new characters" in Europe in all urgency within the meaning of the objective.
A spokesman for the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis compared with the Italian economy even taking into account the new Government doesn't change".
The EU, which believes that Rome does not reach its target of budget balance in the year 2013, despite the savings plans dealt in these last months, has requested in particular new Härtemaβnahmen.
"" "Emma Marcegaglia", Chief of the chiefs Italy, which will meet on Tuesday to Monti, is also on the need to stimulate the economy", as a country that has no to demonstrate growth, can not respect the deficit figures".
M. Monti, who is known for his expertise, as well as its independence as a Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epochal change" Italy after 17 years "Berlusconi butter"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trust" and a "another Italy", so the editorial authors.
The great unknown here taken the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would prevent like early elections since Italy from now to come up until April 2012 for 200 billion euro Government bonds.
Russian scientists will help the Iranian nuclear energy program
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, has helped the Iran to develop a detonator usable with a nuclear, a specialist on nuclear risks, American NGO confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for science and international security ISIS the result is based on the recent report of the International Agency for nuclear safety, IAEA, as well as other, posed by this United Nations agency documents to determine of this scientist.
The IAEA had communicated their 'serious concern' on the occasion of a "possible military dimensions" of Iranian Nuklearprogrammes last week.
According to the in-depth study of the IAEA documents on the part of ISIS, the 1934 born Danilenko worked apparently over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear Centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
1989 or 1991 he should have left the Center, to form a company in Kiev, which establishes "Nano-diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him in 1995 to to contact the Iranian Embassy in the Ukraine.
Before his return to Russia he worked then from 1996 to 2002 in an Iranian programme.
In its last report, the IAEA said "a point of strong evidence, that the Iranian development" a nuclear explosive system "through the work of a foreign expert support been was, which taken versed not only in this technology accreditations, but in addition, as a member of the State reported by the Agency, his entire career of indispensable in this technology directly to the military nuclear programme in his country of origin have."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50 %
The crimes against Muslims and offences rose from 2009 to 2010 by 50%, whereas other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday in the same period either declined slightly or have only slightly increased.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes perpetrated against Muslims of 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49% had risen, whereas a 13% increase in the violence against Catholics, a 4% decline against Jews of facing criminal offences, as well as a global increase of 14% on anti-religious crimes and offences had been recorded.
The Gesamtziffer of "hate-motivated crime" had risen in very low efficiency to 6.628 cases, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences-motivated crimes, so the FBI.
"" After a slowdown in 2009, it is to see disturbing again grow these crimes and offences", the human rights organisation stressed rights first human"."The rise of anti-Islamic violence is especially significant," said the organization in a communique added.
Paul Legendre, a person in charge of the Organization, "Human rights first had stressed long time, that the violence against the Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes as a heavy Gesetzesverstoβ human rights should be considered", added in.
"The US Government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added under assessment, that this could be done in improving the police attitude towards the "hate crime".
The "hate crimes" presents itself in American Federal law as an inheritance from the period of the struggle for the civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings, to punish acts of violence, which are directed against race, color, religion, or origin and includes now also the crime of sexual affiliation.
Twitter transforms the platform and is similar to more and more Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter has introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday, in particular to enable their users to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, allowing the service once again from Facebook that resemble.
The new tab "Activity" and "Name" enable better legible live track of the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("tweets") following and that track your messages.
This makes it possible to find out whether they allow their messages to track whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu was tested from his general spread of the Internet on Monday "in August for a small percentage of users", Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn stated Penner before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for his little instinctive operation, equipped with something esotherisch Latin text (RT to repeat the post of someone else referenced). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur of initiés s ' ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui of Réseaux grand public Facebook et Google +.
Users debated on the network with the help of certain "tweets" on Internet about this innovation.
"This is pointless, intrusive and looks too much like Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"" "The function of"Activity"will help me better to pursue certain elements of my flux twitters", announced @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Registration of a "Golden budget rule" in the Constitution
Which is in Austria in power owned the large social-democratic/Christian-Democratic Coalition Government on Tuesday decided to record a "Golden budget rule" in the Constitution, to reduce public deficits and to avoid even a possible degradation on the part of credit rating agencies in the top credit rating (AAA) Austria.
The social democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann was highly personal, who announced this decision of the output of the Council of Ministers had, even though the public Austrian government debt at 74.6% is, so far above that the Maastricht Treaty criterion laid down by 60%, significantly below the level of debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"Would be dropped the solvency of Austria not in one fell swoop from AAA to AA +, so we would have to pay each year in addition three billion interest", Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democrat had argued.
Austria are also a requirement of the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the euro area on 26 October instead of: the heads of State and Government had at that time required until at the end of 2012, as well as a return to the public Kontengleichgewicht in the Constitution or through an equivalent law including the reduction of public deficits.
The action taken by the Austrian Government is similar to the "German model", because Germany had been the first European country that had taken such a "rule" in the Constitution.
By the year 2017 should be the structural budget deficit every year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) lower, commencing in 2017 the State's structural budget deficit should not exceed 0, 35% level of GDP, whereas the regional States as well as the municipalities should have balanced budgets.
It aims, in the horizon of 2020 / 21 the budget debt below the 60% laid down by the Maastricht Agreement criterion to eradicate.
Strong yen
Noda is threatening a new intervention in the currency markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda has warned on Tuesday that the Japanese power would again intervene in currency markets if the yen should continue to rise.
"Should we an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen "to say, so we will intervene as well as we last did it", said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday the yen was shot up in turn close to historical levels, which had forced the Japanese authorities, on 31 October, to the action.
On this day, Tokyo had sold massively yen against the dollar to reduce the Japanese currency value, which is in the process to control a new record since 1945 against the dollar.
The yen is however regularly about increased, doped with purchases by investors who see the yen as a "refuge"value in these uncertain times of world economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has slipped under the symbolic bar of 105 Yen in the vicinity of the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009 recorded the dollar around the 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This Flash in the pan of the Japanese slogan detrimental to exports of the archipelago, because it makes more expensive costs of "made in Japan" products and reduced the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, because they they exchange them in local currency.
"Japan fight after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), for its reconstruction", stresses M. Noda, who feared that this inflation of the yen could already kill the weak recovery in the bud.
The third economic world power has grown again with the growth in the third quarter of - 1.5% compared to the previous gewordenen for the first time this year thanks to the sharp export increases and consumption of households by the disaster "sealed" traction.
The Prime Minister however estimates that inflation of the yen reflected not "the economic foundations of Japan".
The Minister of finance Jun Azumi has in turn the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy Committee on Tuesday, invited to take all possible measures to invalidate the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has however set having regard to the BoJ have "appropriate measures", already launched which Staub was that on Wednesday no additional monetary easing to expect was.
On the occasion of the last meeting in late October, the Central Bank had increased their State bond purchases to 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to eradicate the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion) coverage amounts that had consumed them for various purchases of Financials, to flood the liquidity market.
Euro zone:
Zinsfüsse rapid high, stock markets make back down
The risk of the debt crisis constantly undermines the European figures.
The rates of the weakened also rise constantly continued to rise despite taking office the new Government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best economic growth in France and Germany.
Stock markets, which are still concerned the stability of the euro zone, drifting from this Tuesday, the November 15 a little more in negative realm.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 am and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Because of new tensions over the yields of government bonds in the in difficulties under euro-zone global equity markets continue to release a portion of their recent profits."
"Investors are nervous and are only too well aware of the risk of infection", explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG markets, quoted by the news agency of Reuters.
The stock market in Tokyo, who in turn suffers renewed fear of market participants with regard to the capacity in Europe, that the debt crisis to continue last, had closed with a fall of 0.7%.
"" Japan as well as the rest of the world has set his eyes on Europe, and trade moves on limited variation corridor, as long as the investors have no evidence, that the situation has stabilised,"estimates Mitsushige Akino, Fund Manager at Ichiyoshi investment management."
This resurgence of concern over the future of the eurozone harms the single currency their Baiss to continue on Tuesday.
The euro moves for one and a half months to its lowest level.
European value of 1,3570 dollar was worth about 10 pm, she gave way to so by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she declined after had an application of the CDU party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, gathered in the Congress on Monday, approved, which specifically provides for the possibility emerging countries for themselves in trouble, to withdraw from the euro area, without having to leave the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% threshold.
The loan interest rates of Italy and Spain are still at a very alarming level.
The return of Italian bonds to 10 years 6.85% reached this Tuesday morning, one of the Spanish title matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of the interest rates in the Südländern, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
Mario Monti, the future Italian Prime Minister demanded a more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by paralysis by the burden of debt in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas of Papademos had in turn confirmed the implementation of on the occasion of on 27 October at the Summit of the euro area decisions taken were "the main task" his Government.
Spain is located in the Visir of the markets, since the parliamentary elections in the country will take place on Sunday.
The interest rate gap ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
In anticipation of euro-zone economic growth
Statistically France generated by the household consumption registered economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, ergo a little better than the expected 0.3%.
The statistical Federal Office INSEE had however revised the bear market of the numbers of the second quarter with a decline of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter, which concerns most economists.
Germany had in turn over the same period to record a growth of 0.5%.
A first projection of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 am, the Commission warns of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should defeat the dogmas
A theme that not on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions cannot be treated there certainly is energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises in direct measurements.
It is reasonable to take a selection meeting to the events, to reflect on this issue, as well as on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if she probed the entire of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should their opinions on objective facts, provide rational data.
Although 7 billion people on this planet are located, the demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by the year 2050, not an enormous proportion of the world's population must waive a vital element.
At the same time, you must alleviate the shortage of fossil resources continue constantly to produce electricity without the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a subject of disappearance from the environmental debate, forgetting to combat climatic border irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima changed none of this parameter.
Therefore blives Germany still in its decision isolated, to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its decision the need to find a substitution-aware replacement source in the Switzerland just intended to build only nuclear power stations of the last generation.
UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few States, however, continue to monitor their projects with determination.
The United States decided in turn to Fukushima, to integrate to a further unit their Park, by the plant closed after the nuclear accident again taking three mile Iceland in operation.
Although geared towards renewable sources of energy, German model is occasionally presented as a role model, so the reality contradicts the discourse however.
The choice in Berlin will be in the form of an increase of the price of electricity, an energetic dependence reinforced by the increased use of imported gas in particular Russia, an increase of gas and coal-fired plants caused CO2 emissions put down.
All these unpleasant effects will manifest itself already within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to thinking.
Denmark is on the one hand European League leaders with regard to wind energy, from which it applies 30% of its electricity, on the other hand the country of one of the largest user of coal and gas is alternately used with wind energy; aufgrunddessen are its CO2 emissions, as well as its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the resistance of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a higher in contrast to our French households by 40% electricity bill.
Because the price of energy in the globalised economy represents a key role in the competitiveness, as well as a pledge of stability the industry on national soil, the French companies on the basis of the cheapest electricity in Europe have an advantage.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would entail therefore a strong increase in the price of energy, what would become the noble statements about the Reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of the purchasing power of illusion.
Surveys showed that that was a price, the vast majority of French people is willing to pay as little, as opposition to the principle of this energy source they suggests.
We remember that the energy policy of our country has allowed to establish an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to their strong export nature brings you a host of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises on international markets, making these creators of countless jobs.
France should take the decision to abandon nuclear power, the a majority of these SMEs victim would fall, and the annual EUR 6 billion in capital and nuclear export would shrink together more and more.
What electricians would instruct an EPR designed to work on sixty years if the decline of his producers is inevitable?
To solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is a magic bullet for the generation of electricity work of the nor one like a devil.
Developed by the company Areva, -carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy bear witness to the complementarity of energy sources.
An absolute imperative is to maintain the highest possible level of safety for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority carried out by uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as in the construction in Flamanville.
Their teams that have made a name for itself due to their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the security presentation.
50 Years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only a single one in three mile Iceland, under normal operating conditions occurred; so he proceeded without consequences for man and the environment.
Chernobyl, the drama has been invoked by reactor construction, as well as unendschuldbares, human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two unprecedented disasters which caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will pull their lessons as well from this accident, as she had done after the two previous.
As the fruit of this approach, as well as a cooperation between of the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a design which allows him resistance to such phenomena.
Because under the contractors as desirable, considers it to build a nuclear power plant, a construction in Flamanville would a fabulous gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, by it could be them free reign, to seize the leadership position in the inevitable development of nuclear power in itself.
It is inevitable and legitimate to search for the best arrangement of energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to dominate a debate emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber, determines the as well as economic, social and financial situation in our country.
Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from many angles - overload by police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy that subjected the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France even had dubbed himself.
Recently the harassment directed against foreign students from official site had coined the newsreels, the Minister of the Interior had casually (see liberation of May 23) announced that France "need have no talents, bricklayer or waiter from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
On this subject, there is namely a far-reaching consensus between right and left.
By right the tone was struck by Jacques Chirac, 1976 had declared that "900,000 unemployed people, including over 2 million immigrant workers, no problem for a country are likely to constitute', from left side by Michel Rocard, who had outlined in 1990, France"could take not the overall poverty of the world".
The only difference is in the degree of Groβzügigkeit
The fear of invasion of the national soil through hordes of Polish plumber was split in 2005, both right and left.
Immigrants as a burden for the economy and the French company have been perceived by both camps.
The only difference is in the degree of Groβzügigkeit you to admit the immigrants against is willing.
François hollande is confined in its programme to banalities that indicate, co-development allow to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a last, as a problem, can possibly affect the elections; However, it is economically costly.
As Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron economists in a recent work, remember, that summarizes the latest findings regarding the Immigration (exceptional people: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, may 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), a broad consensus with regard to the positive impact of the immigrant flood on growth, wages and jobs in the immigration exists among the specialists.
To restrict immigration, growth would undermine and harm the labour market situation.
The concerns over the influence of migrants are based on the, to substitute by they exerted pressure on their wages idea that they threaten, the local workers, especially the less qualified.
However, experience has shown that immigrants in fact are significantly complementary than than the local wage laborers because they perform schwerpunktmäβig professions in sectors that are under terms of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that slightly irritate local wage laborers, the more qualified among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors in which training is in line not the job.
Positive effect of wage
As well as a surgeon would have difficulty to work where an anesthesiologist shortage, so this complementarity between locals and migrants causes a positive effect of immigrant immigration on wages and national labour market situation in a country.
Giovanni peri has in this way and manner calculated that a 1% increase in the immigrant flood do cause miteinbezogene, long-term increase of in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants is conducive of idea creation and economic growth (high percentage of naturalized immigrants under American Nobel Prize winners;) (Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants contribute also net to social systems, in European countries on average approximately at an altitude of 1% of the overall budget.
For example, the International Labour Organisation estimates that someone wandering in the age of 30 after Germany is a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) to the 150,000 euros the public budget on average over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate to bring the missing points of intersection "with teeth".
These aforementioned teeth which should deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to consider European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; also a delicate commodity.
The European continent should be even can remember, who had the entire 20th century about the tragedies of World War I, of totalitarianism, of Holocaustes, of the Gulag, but also Franco's in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece about themselves after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago fare.
Some had probably believed it rich, to exercise the right to vote, and on direktest possible manner to democracy a triumph over their enemies for all to see.
Since Napoleon "miniature", we know that it was a characteristic of the attitude.
Universal suffrage, which is necessary condition of democracy, this is not sufficient condition and can be just as well to the "repressive instrument", as at the time the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, education, economic and social community spirit, a case law.
The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is first and foremost and as much political and democratic crisis.
In this respect, the change of attitude of the Greek true false referendum had twice revealing character: once the the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the unsettling feeling of their impossibility of their Unangebrachtheit.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least the target most of them, no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain, to push to a success of the national referendum which was organized according to the needs and in reverse order.
A free ticket for the European tyrant or a jump blindfolded into the emptiness of the nationalist retreat: A great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, in full right, have shed off and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, you know Spain and Portugal - in addition not been, where the list to stop - because it is only a single crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is all over Europe, which bends the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from his impotence and his lack of solidarity.
It is all over Europe, which is humiliated at the international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe — this is the throughout Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and each of it affiliated Nations.
The urgent need is to give the leadership of the European project of popular sovereignty back to the hand.
Because it is situated at all whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, make free from the markets, and to initiate a future investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level to the condition, which can be taken without total democratic church without certainly lead us to destruction.
After this proposal was opposed by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, long time, everyone today urges the European economic governance to do so.
Agree.
But one would be without political integration and a stronger democracy - how she see the citizens - to imagine this, folly and a more dead end again.
We need to make a new stage in European construction on us.
To make France arise the Republic, it took the fact that establishing "Republicans".
The revolution of the interests alone could not enough do.
This information is still valid.
We need to make a better integrated economic Europe.
This can only be achieved by a politically seen more democratic Europe creates, a genuine European sovereignty of the people.
We need Europeans to make Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards become the common property
The world fair for chip cards opens its doors in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday in a more optimistic attitude.
The year 2011 should according to Eurosmart actually with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (debit cards, SIM cards phone) end with more than 6 billion units sold.
The tragendste segment is the contactless technology which enables payments in public transport or settlement of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the one year previously 320 million sold should this year 460 million contactless smart cards sold worldwide are!
Their market share should further increase (580 million units expected) in 2012 and represent about 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after it for a long time is lagged behind the Asia Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France are the beginnings of rather modest: only 400,000 contactless Visa cards were distributed.
However, the consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards so this year.
To go to higher speed, it is now necessary that the banks provide their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed systematically deliver their customers bank cards, which are equipped with contactless chips", Gerard Nébouy, General Manager of Visa Europe France Announces.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
This is only a first step on the way to the cash of the future: the mobile phone.
A vanishingly small percentage of devices has been equipped with the necessary to conduct these transactions NFC technology (near field communication).
"You have come in default".
"But at least next year, they should experience a real upward trend."
"We expect in 2012 with the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had yesterday announced the launch of a test run in Caen, will expire by December to next June.
The iPhone's some 200 customers and staff are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale had testified yesterday, to prepare the launch of an offer, which allows contactless payment by mobile phone customers.
Terrorist front itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is very concerned about the relationship between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long under suspicion relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy had Abdelkader Messahel itself had confirmed that Algiers "had become certainty now about".
He said "how to proceed with the two organizations, as well as the relations of the intelligence services indicate a clear cooperation", without going further into the details.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation of the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in last January have promoted interfaces for days.
In a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi of kidnapped Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory should have been on the following day at the same time as several of their captors during an operation carried out by the French special forces getöten.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several phone chips in the rubble at the site, which belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the listed phone calls leads to several interlocutors who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI) investigators interested in in particular the numbers two interlocutors: numbers leads to a Nigerian, who himself had; stopped for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in Northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram the other leads to a man, as the Aqmi and the sect close below applies.
"This is a step forward, one must wait however undoubtedly clearer evidence before one can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko harem".
"It is however conceivable."
The Nigerian researchers Kunle Amuwo softens from "Man white for years, that the sect concerns financial and intellectual support from Auβen and that it shows increasingly active".
In these last few months, these "benefits" have become always obvious during its course, as well as the speeches and the modes of operation of Boko harem, which now consult of suicide bombers, as well as the use of always more complex explosives indicate, which bear the same signature as the ones that were used by Aqmi.
The international community, to begin in Washington, has exerted pressure since then to Abuja, so that one there takes into consideration the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have considered the grouping in fact long time community of Illuminati, that no special attention must be paid.
Quick success
In the year 2002 in Maiduguri in environment a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf so much meaning based Boko Haram - in Haoussa like "Western education is a shame" - pursues the creation of an Islamic Emirate in Muslim Northern of Nigeria.
In this destitute area, the merger is experiencing rapid successes.
You are politicized and requires strict adherence to Sharia, while using their affiliated activists in the fight against the godless Government.
First, the activists have churches, bars and authorities in the line of fire.
2009, the activists of Boko Haram with their increased attacks against the morgues were particularly active.
But as usually in differentiated is a reaction on the part of Abuja.
The army surrounded the city, it is one of 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, in captivity was killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is increasingly radical and leaves its stronghold in the North.
She pleaded to assassinated in Jos that claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja last Christmas.
In June, Boko Haram blame a suicide attentates is assigned to that which took place in the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations priority international target device.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead Mauritania about Nigeria after Somalia, concerned since all security experts.
While that has occupied Aqmi Mali and the Niger, operate the Somalis by al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko seems to be harem a new threat in the Centre of the continent.
"Last week hatta Alain Juppe during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria before Boko harem warned and shown itself ready," all notes to communicate.
The world gemäβ of the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in oversimplification and ignorance with regard to China's, the Iraq, and the support for Israel.
A crisis geschwächtes America can a complex world with simple, not to say: simplistic ideas lead?
So listening to the Republican presidential candidate, voters could get nearly this impression.
Since a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, have repeatedly disclose their thundering declarations, as well as their statements regarding the foreign, traditional republikanischem focus, Rick Perry and their supporters.
On China, the Iran and the Israel help falling - often in no way based - slogans.
He most highly threatened with regard to the appointment of the "grand old party" in due course Mitt Romney to cite the Chinese to the WTO and to accuse them of "currency manipulation" leading topic in an America that through the migration of entire industries to Asia on the utmost is irritated-.
Stupid run, if this should imply initiate a trade, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China under Obama and sole candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign, has lined the air is almost in terms of his attitudes schmeichelnden the emotions.
He had called for a solid, but constructive conversation Exchange with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama's).
But Huntsman is not heard because he is stagnating in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had praised also military strikes against the Iran, if the sanctions to the Stoppung of Nuklearprogrammes should fail.
"If I am elected, I command put an end the Iran", he had tinted.
"Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb".
Also has he promised increased military aid Israel and Obama accused still guilty this partners against commitments.
The businessman Herman Cain, second placed candidate, in turn carries a shameful ignorance of the file display.
Recently he urged, "try to develop" a nuclear power - and seemed except eight while the fact the Chinese military threat to give, since Beijing against admitting that China is already since 1964 in the possession of military nuclear weapons!
In turn, the Texas Governor Rick Perry, which supports Israel and calls for military strikes against the Iran, about to be ready to take the American army in Mexico against drug cartels in service.
The 2009 prohibited by Obama use of Foltermaβnahmen compared to mutmaβlichen terrorists was also advocated by Cain, Perry, as well as the Kandidation Michele Bachmann.
It is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an auβenpolitischen heavyweight.
The current presidential rivals, Reagan have also simple ideas had and still won the cold war.
Call in mind that also Obama selbstein amateur and had to pay water in his wine, what concerned the subject of anti-terrorism.
You rightly insist on the failure of his naive discourse with the Iran, of the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from the Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This Anfeindung is however not quite as casual.
The population estimates rather the positive balance of national security under Obama that bin Laden has turned off.
Since the Iraq, it guards against military interventions that lead to the clog.
And Obama surprisingly adequate, by he argues, America should economically be rebuilt to bring its leadership to new life.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The gas pipeline Nord Stream that runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and Western Europe connects directly with Russia, was put into operation.
She will provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with pomp and circumstance.
About 500 invited guests, including four heads of State and Government, stream have attended last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under the orchestral sound reinforcement and gourmet buffet of the inauguration of the new gas pipeline Nord, which directly connects Russia and Germany under the sea level.
German Chancellor Angelica Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart have mark Rutte from the Netherlands symbolischerweise together behind the wheel of the valve upside down, which promoted the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year should be delivered by a first pipeline 1.224 km long, connecting the region St. Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, to Western Europe.
A second pipeline that allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - to be completed end of 2012.
And you can already sound to the eventuality of the construction of a third pipe on your own route.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this enormous building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will a direct gas allow namely after Germany, and by avoiding any Trassenverlaufs by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the land.
For this reason, these two countries lose their power a little: for them, it is now harder to exert pressure on Russia by them threaten to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was spared back not afraid to compare the "Nord Stream" pipeline with a "new German Soviet Pact" in connection to the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject of politically äuβerst is sensitive.
Western Europe has gained a greater security of supply through the assertion of this Russian project.
This is however at the expense of an exposure of European energy, because the project has taken a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia it done brought in barely five years, his vision of a direct Alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that have strong Gasverbrauche and whose gas reserves running out, go to enforce.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the opening of the gas pipeline by he pointed out to what extent the vast gas contracts also from political and economic side are important.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous represented in Lubmin Gazprom Manager with regard to the gas line.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technology.
The underwater cable is made of steel with concrete coating to protect them from ship anchors.
You resting on the ocean floor about 200 metres in depth.
In its construction had to be dodged war FP4 minefields.
"About hundreds of mines had to just in case be removed or destroyed", stated Jens Müller, spokesman of the company Nord Stream.
There had to be taken enhanced measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The line is a long line of metal, hard as 242 Eiffel, which is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither by valves, even maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project took distance from, since the Sweden little on it were eager to see in a permanent way to level its coastline settle a Russian State company.
"In the event of an accident we close the gas flow in less than a minute", explained Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak that escapes itself in the gas pipeline owned gas so into the air.
This case is considered but probably by design engineers little, because the Schweiβnähte was estimated to be a resistance of a leak per 100,000 years.
The State monitoring of gas transmission is both guaranteed by an underwater robot, which controlled for external observation purposes of a seagoing ship out is as also from a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, miβt a meter in diameter, is introduced into the Interior of the pipe and moving through the gas pressure.
After three full days of locomotion through the pipe at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device on his arrival provides most accurate details of the possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline is designed for fifty years to work, without even the slightest repair must be subjected to.
Quite simply, the gas circulation is ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry, 100 bar at the exit site.
Five companies have combined their forces to the realisation of this project.
However, the wiring remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Still, the German companies of E. ON and BASF are affiliated (according to 15.5%), here as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company GDF Suez (according to 9%).
These five companies have formed a business community, called Nord Stream and which is entrusted with the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its registered office in Zug in the Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has rented then the entire capacity of its gas transport company, on twenty-year renewable contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the capacity, no matter how much the real transport fails volume of gas", explained Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was secured 30% of shareholders, as well as to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour cost should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez the investment was for example, 240 million.
The minority shareholders are however gewiβ to recoup their expenses, because Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline is a sandy, pine-forested coastline at Lubmin Baltic revealed.
The 4.5-meter valves form the gas exit gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature, and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is forwarded in the German gas pipeline.
Since last Tuesday, this Terminal with a million m3 of Russian gas passes hour is supplied.
At full capacity, 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012 would be this.
Moleskine, a brand book.
About fifteen years ago in life launched by an Italian company, Moleskine would like to give now new style writing.
It has an air of adventure, by candlelight with writing spent hours.
The notebook from Moleskine is easily recognizable with his black, rectangular cover, his rubber band, the eierschalfarbenen pages, as over time towards aged.
The Moleskine notebook, as we know it today originated however in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided to take a distinguiertes design notebook on the market at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, at that time the expert advisor of the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook was from a traditional production technology, called mole (Mole skin) skin inspired, which refers to a Baumwollack, which is used, for example, for covers of upholstered benches.
This kind of notebook was very much in demand among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has resurrected an old and almost forgotten item, which until the 20th century avant-garde artist was an icon", explains Maria Sebregondi, now Markenverantwortliche in modo modo.
The success occurs.
Increase sales by 26% between 2006 and 2010 and establish itself with a paragraph of 12.7 million.
This is far from the usual production of the first year where only 3,000 notebooks are designed.
Moleskine crossed the Italian border and runs in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make an identikit of the buyer, since the notebook inspires as well as business people such as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open geistiger customers.
The small Italian company which had 12 employees in its infancy, employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as FNAC, in small boutiques in the city centres and sees itself out to enforce his identity.
"We have followed the spirit of the times and his new Schreibbedarf, which despite the recovery of emails", said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched an exposition called "detour (detour)" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno also brought a cover with Leopard print on the market.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and understood it to diversify its products: bags, schedule, filler, machine hull... The brand is in the whole range of articles.
A success, the envy brings to the plan: in the autumn of 2006 Modo Modo was purchased by the SG capital Europe, the current Syntegra capital investment fund, and set up so that a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate handicapped person at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for people with disabilities".
Despite a purposeful public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average mean value: 19% against 9% unemployment of the population as a whole.
Disheartening?
"No, so Eric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association adapt that aligns the"week of work for people with disabilities"stressed."
"The progress achieved fifteen years are substantial."
"At that time the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless enormously much remains to do."
It must be said, however, that for the disabled unemployed still many obstacles continue, before they get a job.
More often it is true the older ones: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
Have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no high school diploma, and there are only 10,000 people with disabilities among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared to 38% in the total section.
In short, there are so many criteria which make a renewed work quickly, and which "Form the core of the problem", Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, is an association founded in 1992, the company help, hampered the to recruit workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
Remains unspoken, the attitudes which although of course, but still slowly evolving.
A study conducted in April by the IMS Entreprendre Association for the magazine La Cité stated, the managers surveyed have "a weak level knowledge with regard to people with disabilities", which is "over-represented" "of persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually Minderbemittelten".
Result is that private companies have still a long way to go with more than 20 employees in order to achieve the employment target of 6% handicapped workers, which was enshrined in a law of 1987.
These latter, directed 2008 figures refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%" reported to collect contributions from companies Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization that is responsible, which flout this law.
The proof: Number operations "be paid fees" has as well as the sum of the paid amounts between 2007 and 2011 decreased, namely zahlenmäβig from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Act of 2005, which provides for contributions, created a strong pressure on the company, declared Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses a genuine knowledge particularly in the large groups."
According to the Ministry of labour, deal with only 59% of the premises between 20 and 49 employees disabled people in work, companies with 100 to 199 employees, however, 82%.
Hazard: "What good fortune"
Already before them the "Eden had not concealed hazard and Georges Leekens her pleasure that brought them the friendly blue Tuesday (20: 45) offered forehead."
It would be picked up too far, to claim there was a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the podium the audience of the Stade de France George Leekens and Eden had can make good and like to hazard peace.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his Angriffsspielers against Turkey the Belgian coach had harvested nothing but praise on his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I would like to look forward," assures the native Liller in turn.
With regard to the contrast between its representation in Club and national team "a unit, this justifies everything."
"In Lille I am which is not the case in Belgium throughout the year,".
"It is time for me to go at the start".
Hazard will come to Saint Denis, brought Friday night against Romania in terms of matches against France to finally "to shine".
Without however to refrain from the touch of "pleasure".
He fires at the French national team since the age of 7 years, he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported", he confirmed.
This inevitably helps even more to strengthen the "unique" nature of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)-being", he brings to mind.
"We have started us just over the way."
"Large happiness means to play against them!"
Leekens played his part with good nature "The pride" on.
"The pride, a gala match" to play.
"Proud" also - in his capacity as 'Neighbours' - to confirm that France "again has become a team at a very high level", and the little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job" he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium is missing in the next European Championship, so the technician sees itself very well the airplane with the blue (the French national team)... and that the direction of Brazil share in the year 2014.
"We small Belgians come out big", he stressed.
"We're going to plan a thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry".
"You'll notice that at the upcoming games". The game against France was involved.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with large optimism 3–2 to Bosnia (22: 00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, the objectivity was missing two teams.
"At the end of this 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and the Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La semi-finals", his national team, for which he is responsible since September 2010, 2012 will qualify for the European Championship.
For Portugal, this means happiness in fact only 90 minutes.
But there is a match to play and serve as an opponent, and Bosnia.
In the light of Hinspiels (0-0) in Friday the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice still not fallen.
Portugal dominated the game over an hour more than clear, but the team was unable to leave the important mark the thing, which would have increased the pressure from her.
"This is a good result, which, however, carries some risk, because we have scored no away".
At home however, their bright shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese which are convinced yourself before an audience that should be just as hot on the game to make, even if the lot of course as "very scarce" was announced, the optimistic, but clear Bento said.
"We expect a very tight match, are however completely convinced to be able to gain the upper hand," said the 42 year old Portuguese coach.
"We have process continue to a 50% chance at the European Championships 2012 to be" qualified but the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
The draw forcing the Portuguese on Friday in Bosnia, to score a goal and win.
A tie can already meet the Bosnians who also needed a goal.
"This is a good result, which, however, carries some risk, because we have scored no away", regrets Bento.
"We will compete against a team, which has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities", he added.
"As already in Zenica the Portuguese had that, already at the beginning on the Bosnians to exert maximum pressure,"them no time to think give to"."
A good idea, provided that it is implemented into action this time.
