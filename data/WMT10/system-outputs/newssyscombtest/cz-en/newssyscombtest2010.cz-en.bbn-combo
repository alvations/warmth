The lack of snow in the mountains about hoteliers
Ski slopes do not worry about just vlekařům.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and boarding houses.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains still can get free rooms for all winter dates, including the Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a large number of visitors at our website.
People going through, record prices, but so are afraid to order.
And if we call, so I ask if we think will be this year's Christmas in the snow or mud, "said the operator information portal spindl. info Martin Jandura.
Who wants to stay in the New Year's Eve in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to your wishes, I it said the order did not hesitate.
Those who prefer saving money and the quality of accommodation is with him up to second place, he may still try a couple of days to wait.
So far the offer on New Year's Eve mostly a one-week stays.
I think they will be a little more to give, but then they, and they go for a shorter period.
And then will be the room quickly disappear, "he said.
Free beds in all winter dates still available as a travel agency Vrchlabská Ingtours.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
Even half of the jobs in our The offer remains open.
Therefore, we have prepared a cheaper Christmas holidays at the last minute, "said director Peter Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the giant Vrchlabská travel agent may not offer too, but there are fewer vacancies.
Well I sold it the first two days of February, the other winter dates are sold on average.
This year, interest in the winter stays negative impact that in the giant is still not snow.
People wait, if you wish.
No one wants to spend the end of the year the mountains without the snow.
If the during the week of snowy slopes, and even Christmas, "says Schiefert.
On the contrary, slightly better than last year managed to occupy the hotel rooms of Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're on about five percent better.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we have the last couple of places.
A big concern is about the Polish holidays in January and sells well in February, "said the director of the best hotel Karel Rada.
Of the eighty percent of the New Year holidays and the hotel occupied by Omnia in the central parking lot in Janské Spa.
On the contrary, Christmas remains in the latest janskolázeňském even half of the hotel beds available.
Us pleasantly surprised by January this year, which we already have in at this moment of occupied about 60 percent.
A little less is still February, but as soon as the snow, stay interested in the giant certainly rise further, said the hotel manager Omnia Sporysch.
On the the snow, however, but so far they have to go.
On Thursday, be cool, if there are any deductions, and should be snow on the mountains.
But then has once again, come to warming, informed George Jakubský of Hradec managed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
The US is the mother of wisdom:
It's the, with a Barack Obama, the president with a reputation, repeated in the Afghan issue, the strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered it is almost nejhloupějšího.
When he finally vypotil his eagerly awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that it copied over kopírák of Bush's Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only in the text itself uses the word several times the turnover, as in Iraq, "but he did not hesitate even to use the name of Bush's declaration in January 2007 as the name of its own declaration:" New Way Forward ".
However, he was three years ago,, criticized Bush's idea to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq beset by civil war as "irresponsible and in the consequences of their decisions".
The subsequent months have shown, however, that the Bush's strategy based on a recommendation from the field commanders, was the only possible and veleúspěšnou, so much so that today in the intelligence on Iraq at all levels.
Bush's reputation, but objectively he left to his successor a much more situation can be than expected.
In Afghanistan he hopes, Barack Obama in that the miracle again.
The increase in military contingent him again asked a field commanders, in particular the supreme commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley Mccristal, which even Despite the harshly criticized the shooter in the White House.
He asked 40 thousand men, in order to break the situation for the better.
The president for three months hesitated, but nothing better, and so at least the general 10 thousand soldiers.
In fact, Europe was able to squeeze out the promise of a further 5 thousands, even though he initially counted at least 10.
On the whole most problematic for Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as fast for 18 months and end this process within three years. The Obama Doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that the increase in half-baked fruit gives the same procedure as in Iraq.
Despite the internecine wars of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders to honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite sign - the one shall not count and no agreements have not been honored.
Poorly under these conditions, prepare the Afghan security forces used as day to day depending on the Lord, as it suits them.
Political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain just a Potemkin Village, for which will continue to be the patriarchal tribal relations.
The balance the interests of various ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to the ratios, which further complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the establishment of a "the state", which is a minimalist objective of the operation, does not look like all too real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy at his voluntarism.
For the past eight years, the situation has worsened in Afghanistan only and is now on the verge of explosion.
To believe in that sending soldiers into a war in order to "return home"' Cause there made a miracle, can only really romantic soul, the fact untouched.
From a political point of view is, to setting a date for withdrawal of troops by irresponsibility, because the Taliban it will be seen as an implicit recognition of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is nearing.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically to intervene in the situation is developments around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and intensify the sanctions on the Iranians do not do, there will be before the United States, the question of whether not to try to solve the problem of military force.
To answer to it, it will be just at the time when Obama, America will proceed to the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patches for Barack Obama, the fact that in the presidential election three years left, and thus there's still plenty of time to be able to come up with another strategy, if this proves to be a total flop.

The improvements could bring only a strong government, would also be able to rely on the broad consensus of political parties, said the president.
The Chairman Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is awesome, and the government should consider the existence of the other.

A tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela in his life story is the Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he jednadevadesátiletý Mandela asked him whether, in the film to reproduce.
Another important role it plays Matt Damon.
I told him:' If I play, I will have to have access.
The actor, who won the award for his role in the environment of Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, for example, the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, from which eventually became a slave, a fictional US president and even the God of the divine Evan, but it is for someone who is still alive and is for many people as important as Mandela.
Former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work for the end of apartheid in South Africa.
The freedom of the redundancies in 1990, and four years, then became president of the country.

The actor said that if he and the world policies were in the same area, he tried to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, to be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to Mandela to shake his hand.
I found that when you, I'll take your energy, transfers, and I feel that I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon in the film by Francois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players.

The secret of lights over Norway: the Russians tested a missile
Over Norway, it has been possible to observe a special lighting effect of unknown origin.
The Russian ministry of defense yesterday acknowledged that near the Norwegian border tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
Start again but again failed and the missile known as type "Bulava", which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a black nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Neither his repeated presence at the missile tests had on the success of the test flights appropriate effect.
Bulava majority at all off or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspaper was The "Bulava" writes, as "a rocket which cannot fly".
The missile, which cannot fly but shines
This in turn was the 13th experiment was conducted initially normal.
Until the end of the flight was again to technical apparatus.
Apparently the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which went below the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missiles, allows the firing of rockets from the ship, which is in motion and at the same time submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by the unidentified flying object was actually broken "Bulava".
Indeed, the Norwegians from the first moment he had no doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals this time, and that we cannot speak clearly a failure.
The first two stages, and an accident to hit the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down in the first instance.
Although completely by the may not have been a Test start, for the failed leadership of the Ministry of Defense considers that only six out of thirteen.
Almost 50 percent success rate So the generals filled with optimism and and still maintains that "Bulava" will one day fly without problems, and that even can carry up to ten nuclear units with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.

Hyundai with the unions. cancels all overtime
The management of Nosovice Hyundai car with the unions agreed to abolish all of overtime.
It is because of the often nařizovaným overtime trade unions on Monday strike alert.
He confirmed that the car Hyundai spokesman Petr Vanek.
The management, however, wants to trade union leaders to agree even on a Saturday this year's shift.
We cannot waver in our production plan, that it is essential, therefore, it was designed to voluntary overtime on Saturday, 19th December, with the result that would have made two shifts, "said.
Server Sedmička. He wrote that the company employees who work the Saturday shift, offered a bonus of 400.
He will get people back to work on Saturday, the 28th November.
According to the company, has decided to change the way proposed to motivate employees in the overtime.
Either you leave to pay extra for overtime or may choose compensatory time on 28 December, and thus about the day to extend the Christmas holidays, he said.
In addition, all employees Saturday shift they get paid for the fare and lunch.
Whereas the overtime was point and the point of view of comments and complaints from trade unionists, and employees of protesters, last week stopped production, the management yesterday afternoon decided with immediate effect to abolition of any overtime for the month of December, he said.
Staff car companies were until last week forced to practice every day after an eight-hour shift, even two-hour overtime.
After the signing of the agreement, the union strike emergency appeal
Further negotiations between the management and the union is to take place on Friday morning.

Serial production company rode in November last year.
In September this year it produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
The Czech discovery: a substance that takes on the' hardy' virus HIV
A team of Czech and German researchers testing new compounds, which can slow down the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of improved compounds is that it works to the viruses, which already have acquired Against Drugs immunity.
This fact, in some cases, that the compound to a normal variant of the virus is not as strongly as some already available drug.
AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the reproduction of HIV in the body.
Their use, however, is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Moreover, suppression of the virus multiplication has also resulted in the development of the so-called resistant viruses against which the drugs are ineffective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences, Institute of the Czech Republic, Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with resistance to the virus.
They have proved that a substance called metalokarborany acts on a protein responsible for the reproduction of HIV.
Metalokarborany are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus than any other currently used drugs, and therefore may overcome the problem of resistance.
In his work, scientists have come with the new' improved' compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their ties to viral protein.
They have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon atom are linked by a metal, in this case.
The treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of HIV, which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV Protease cleavage caused by the HIV virus would not have been mature infectious viral particles.
When we stop HIV protease, and stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic.
In work published in the scientific journal, The Journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds in which there are two pairs of cages (see table) linked by a short organic chain, which is systematically altered.
A slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti HIV vaccines have been tested in vitro, and also against the resistant (resistant) variants derived from patients infected with HIV.
The effect on the normal variant of the enzyme is not as strong as clinically used drugs, but its effect does not drug-resistant variants against which used drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications of the Metalokarboranů is interesting compounds for further research to the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Řezáčová, head of laboratory Structural Biology Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences.
The argument for the budget. ods began to Fischer, the resists
The head of the ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek, the approved budget for next year as "awesome" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer, should be considered in the continued existence.
The expression of ODS called prime minister for a strong statements.
It leaves you said the time for analysis.
The ODS deputy chairman Petr Necas said that the concept of the cabinet with the support of the Social Democrats and the Green Party, the ODS was clearly not working.
The prime minister, according to must decide whether it intends to rely on the House of Commons minority, which regards the fight against growing deficits, and he wants to stay in office with the parliamentary left.
Access the ODS and social democracy on the issue of public deficits is a fundamentally different, "he said.
The House on Wednesday the adopted budget for the year 2010, but with the amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House had raised the money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
Criticism of the government's proposals to address social democracy, while that that increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
Before the vote, left the hall, comply with the wishes of the government, that the revised budget is less bad thing than a temporary solution.
Frustration and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation even more.
He is convinced that, if he really seriously threatened to leave the office in the case of the adoption of the amendments, the situation could look different.
According to the Czech Television Janota ordered on Monday after the government of the prime minister.
He indicated at that time is considering a further term in office.
The reason is his disappointment of the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer is willing to continue the fight the budget deficit, said the government what to do nominanti Social Democrats, who pushed through changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also clearly say that he would resign if the House approves further legislation increasing the deficit, such as those relating to sick leave, pensions, or an amendment to the staff of the law.
The ODS: ministers
It's a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated haven't done anything wrong, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the US.
He recalled that several ministries are in náměstkovských of people claiming to be the top 09, who voted against the budget.
He stressed that if the Fischer decides to abandon the principle of the fight with the amount of deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct, relying on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the House of Commons".
Then, he says, but cannot count on support from and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I did not think about it, and when it is the current, so it will take, he told reporters in the House, Defense Minister Martin Bartak, who was nominated by the government of the Civic Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer this afternoon left for the agenda of the European Council in Brussels.
At the request of Prime Minister stepped back
Necas also stressed that the ODS would be on Wednesday in the House voted against the Budget amended, if the prime minister, members of the Civic Democrats explicitly requested to ensure that the adoption of the budget.
I do not feel like orphans, we are small children, responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget the absence of the president of the parties in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I have not noticed that my voice was missing.
Even when I was giving up the mandate, so I knew that in the coming months will be to the House and destruction of all positive, he responded.
Under the new rules of procedure will be less trains for almost the same train fares
The Czech Railways from 13 December will cancel or reduce some of the less busy express trains and other connections, on the contrary, will strengthen.

President of the Republic of South Africa was in the period 1994-1999.
High expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when in the Republic of South Africa and the preparation for the world championships in football, at the same time, the media lightly disturbing reports on the increasing racial hatred and discrimination on the part of the black of the ruling majority.

All regions but eventually signed a long-term contract with Czech railways.
All three of the attacks against us and talk about the fact that we choose raisins, while we brought the offer only what they wanted.
He says that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the price of Czech Railways, which were concluded last week.
So we have no choice but to defend myself.
It is a slander against the company Student Agency, he said.
It also said that it has evidence from all the lands that made their actions in accordance with the European law.
Therefore, the Initiative is preparing for the European Commission.
The notification of the complaint is considered to be the continuation of the Media Show Mr Jančura, which serves as a unpaid advertising his company and his own people.
I am, of course, prepared to defend the good name of your and my county and do the same challenge as and the other commissioners.

Vaccination against will be free and optional
Vaccination against since January and break down.
To be the first family for free, and at the same time.
But we do not reverberating voices, it would be compulsory vaccination more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against the peak.
The institute has set a maximum price of vaccines, which will pay health insurance.
Experts have also have clear procedures for the vaccination.
The new vaccine
The vaccine free of charge for children in August
From January to May be free of charge against the children, who were born last year, 2 nd August and later.
The condition is that still did not get even one dose of the vaccine.
Who started the last year or earlier, must himself pay for additional booster.
The first dose of vaccination must be made between 3 and 5, the age of the child.
Last year, voluntarily left their children vaccinated against a quarter of families.
Parents, paid 1600 crowns per dose of even more.
The vaccination, the youngest children are needed for four doses.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies to get on the vaccine dose of 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year.
But the treatment that children without vaccination needed.
Yet for all the vaccination of children was about 500 thousand a year.
Vaccination was introduced by the so-called janotovým package.
It causes inflammation of the middle ear infections, but also a serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
The pneumococcal infection in the US for the year die under investigation in hospitals to 28 children under 10 years.
In addition to the Czech Republic introduced a vaccination of children against pneumococcal in 40 countries.
The vaccination will be compulsory?
At the same time, but there are views that in the future could be the vaccination mandatory.
From January to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
It would be better to vaccination, for example, head of the civic association Unmute Rudolf Kalovský.
His association promotes pneumococcal vaccine in the long run.
Experts at the international conference, which our Association took part, they were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It is not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have managed to push through at least this.
I think that is the way that we have to start now, said Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health but the procedure of vaccination against pneumococcal want to change.
At the moment about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Hornet.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, says Doctor
The president of professional practice doctors Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all the children were vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of booster "in situations where this vaccine is the high amount, quite understand the political decision that vaccination was started as a voluntary," says, of course, cabrnochová.
Experts expect that their infants be immunized against pneumococcal from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents.
Vaccination against pneumococcal is a breakthrough in that it was the first area of the vaccination of children borne by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should be spending money on prevention, thus saving on further treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the substances themselves.
But with the practical concerns related to children's doctors, which the purchasing vaccines.
According to the original intent of the vaccine should buy insurance companies and doctors would receive, as they become available substance to the other vaccinations.
Some members, however, feared that this would mean that insurance companies "to transfer the money from health insurance."
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substance and wait for them to reimburse insurance companies.
According to estimates, the individual child doctors to invest in vaccines 40 thousand a month, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy at all, says Cabrnochová.
Still, they and we
It may be a Muslim Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the building of minarets, and in general, spread scare stories about the OF ALLEGED Islamization Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and thought about it that can integrate Muslims - and whether integrate - to one of the continent's secular societies.
Some of the readers, after reading this book became the artist's latest work, "why the French do not like on his head" (2006), this elegant and discussed a study on the contentious issues that divide and employ the country already for a period of 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
The last book Mr. Bowen has a broader and more ambitious scope.
Like a good anthropologist wants to know not only what the politicians and the media said about Islam in France, but what actually happened in the base.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which are now taking care of 5 to 6 million of French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen called "Islamic".
It is a good listener, reproduces the debate between teachers and students on issues, which is most worried about.
Should a Muslim to enter into marriage in the mosque or at City Hall (or in both places)?
He should be a young Muslim taught on the development of and gay rights?
It may be a Muslim to marry a man who is not a Muslim?
A Muslim has the right to use of interest-based banking system if it wants to get a mortgage?
These are the seemingly mundane issues, which are discussed, and which are part of everyday life, rather than the political dramas, which employ media.
Author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known people, including the Tarik Ramadan, Arab, Muslim scholar and academic, who was born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a discussion on how you can at the same time be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have arguments for all of their custom.
The conservatives are suspicious of the actual Idei French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen conducted interviews, tend to, that this is a counterpart Selafiho-purist Sunni supporters of Islam, combined in Saudi Arabia - This group is small, but also affects the European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and the French secularism are compatible.
But the adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
IT IS wonders how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who doggedly defends the general public) really committed to the idea of pluralism.
It is of the opinion that the Muslims are in matters of faith are less likely experience than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises to the secular Republikánstvím.
Rather than the development of pragmatism found "tightening the screws values."
It may be a Muslim Frenchman? After reading this book, can anyone have a tendency to say "yes, but not now."

Interests olejářských, plynařských and fishing companies must be focus on new natural sources of water, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their wake.
In the book "On Thin Ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the icons of the north, the polar bear.
Familiar with a complicated history and practice of whaling describes a long tradition of polar explorers, who tried to seize the white bear.
The meeting with Admiral Nelson's bold čtrnáctiletým lifeguard, who fought only with muskets, is actually a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears, who swam for the bodies of their mothers being killed, they capture and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, was once in a circus tent 75 polar bears.
Even today, the enclosure at the zoo are typically a million times smaller area than the area you are available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely appropriate: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of the species.
Even if the hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunting from helicopters and Indians, and all are armed with assault rifles executive, which blasting their prey.
The irony is that it takes place in the water to the north pole of the two nations, and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "The Ice" Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, and has a clear responsibility of the dismal science in the Arctic and a glimpse at how it can change the future.

The U.S. government contractor jailed Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has the U.S. government contractor, which imported mobile phones and laptops to the country, according to officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for the Society of Development Alternatives, Inc.. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers, along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana for access to boarded, who was arrested on 5th December.
Certain charges has not been made public, but according to the Cuban rights may be a Cuban citizen or a foreigner jailed for almost anything that is as "dangerous".
All the so-called "activities, which include mild protests and critical paper, raise the risk of incarceration.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered to be serious offences.
In Cuba, there is a young blogging community, led by a popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband followed and harassed by government agents.
Ms. Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country, in order to receive the prices, but it was denied permission.
The detention of the American suppliers may be the result of the growing tensions between the communist Castro's brother, reigning in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was monitored as a "delaying tactic" to improve relations with the island.
As the first report on the imprisonment of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy, emphasized that if the Cuban government has taken concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodity in a country where the average civil servant's salary is $15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just in this year; they are used mostly prpo textovýchg send messages because 15-minute phone call would cost more than a daily wage.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and some government přípojkách, such as universities.
The Cubans, who often want to log on, their names must notify the government.
Access to many of the Web site is prohibited.
Detention of American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of US citizens in the prison in Cuba is behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbenová, press officer for the American Interests Section in Havana.
Mrs. Berbenová said it can provide more information about the prison.
His arrest and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would in any other open societies are legal - say, a free mobile phones - is a criminal offense in Cuba, "said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. program group For Human Rights, who recently published a report on the freedoms in Cuba, entitled" New Castro, the same Cuba, "as a reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country and pay for the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that any solution would have been more political, and that the Cuban government often provoke a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries seek to extensive dialogue.
Pakistani civil servants rozkrývají conspiracy, relating to the posting of men in Afghanistan.
The Pakistani authorities on Saturday detected the alleged leader of the conspiracy, relating to the deployment of five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of the troops, and said that they hope that this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorists, who on the Internet and looks for young men.
Investigators said they searched for a gray, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after it first appeared, when one of these men make a comment, the authorising officer Terristické attacks Internet website YouTube.
He took over the leadership of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them get into remote areas of Pakistan in the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaida and its training camps for terrorists.
But Pakistani intelligence official, who submitted a report on the case, said on Saturday that it was unsuccessful in commanders of al-Qaida and that the men were part of the CIA trying to infiltration into the terrorist networks.
As a result, they were dropped off for a few days to the Eastern District, far from the mountains in the northwest, which have become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered as a unit.
This is why they were dropped, said the official, who spoke on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not deterred and still trying to obtain consent to gain access to the camps Al-Qaeda, when they were arrested, the power of law.
The case of the five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - emphasizes the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, to determine who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Intelligence Service attaches the highest priority on the location of the human resources to al-Qaeda.
The organizations function as a guard, eliminating those who are not sufficiently serious in its commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
American recruits were subjected to false for al-Qaeda specific aspects, said analysts.
But they were also considered to be extremely interesting in the group, because, given their potential access to U.S. targets, and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation, based in the US, said that terrorist groups also have become more cautious in recent years, in order to allow that came up to them, because the American intelligence agencies experts on their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to penetrate the these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has been already so much? "said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those, which is far more based on the Web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, called climate' action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday to demand stronger action on climate change from the negotiators in the Bella Convention Center of.
The protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police said that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists put several small bombs near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On the day when the incident occurred in the talks on climate change, which sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the city, carrying banners with the English, "This is not a planet" B "(ie minor) and one in španěltštině, that proclaimed, says' enough'."
The protest took part in several celebrities, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, which said that she traveled to the birthplace of his mother in Peru and provide me information about the state of the country, which contributes to the impact of climate change, which is still occurs.
That is part of the reason why we decided to join this great March - to the world and to appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, "she said.
This is not an easy task, but it is necessary to carry it out, it still cannot be avoided.
Police prevented the protesters to converge toward the center of Bella, and said that it had arrested 19 persons, in the first place because they should either deployed or masks or carry a pocket knife.
These activities are under Danish law during the demonstrations.
According to one of the spectators, who did not wish to be identified, because it is involved in rohovorů climate change activists disguised as athletes and in black coats and put several bombs near the main channel Copenhagen, which is located near several ministries.
The buildings, he said zahajivali flares, but followed by "several large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march in the afternoon.
But the protest is likely to penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wei, the chief Chinese negotiator on climate change.
When he was asked whether it should nevertheless be a constructive impact on the international negotiations, said the English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (actually it's something you do not realize).
Then he went in and said, "because the venue is large, I cannot hear what's going on outside."
Monitor whether the March of Pain or helpful, depending on the outlook for each.
You can see the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "We can also say that it is a distortion of the negotiations or the freedom of others.
The date of the test data revealed a persistent racial disparities
A federal certificate from last week on the knowledge of mathematics was a welcome element of good news about the Public School District of Columbia.
Although the district lags far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate showed greater progress for pupils in fourth and eighth classes for the last two years than in cities, including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Center for Progress in the teaching are persistent differences in the knowledge between African Americans and white students and both the page after page of local, as well as national.
The average result of white students of fourth-class district Columbia for the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but their American peers were nrůstu only three points from 209, to 212.
The difference in the knowledge is actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
The progress of African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant one point of 245 to 245.
The result of the average for white students was not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not large enough.
The image in term of six years is not very encouraging.
The difference between white and black students in fourth class in 2003, when the NAEP was first performed in the district was 60 points scale (262 to 202).
Even if the result achieved in children from groups improved during this period, the difference is approached the 58.
Some advocates of education in the district in the last week say that the results, Secretary Michelle a A. rheeovou and the Mayor Adrian M. fentym (d) were for white students, where there were already high results.
That would be hinting that we have increased the amount of aid of those at the higher end of the scale, which is troubling and disturbing, "said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality vdělávání in the district.
Jumping up and down due to the scattering of two or three points, said, "the committee member, Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade elementary school in Eaton.
Often the of management style Mrs. Rheeové, Mrs Brown said that a report on the results of the test means school education in the city is in a desperate state and needs attention.
It is clear that we always want to see the pros and I respect that.
But what is that we did not pay almost no time and energy, which was needed to pay our secondary education.
Mrs. Rheeová said that the district is a continuation of the search for better ways of addressing the needs of students with low results.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new curriculum is read, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in higher grades of primary schools and high schools, students who failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their school Kariéřea significantly lag behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics curriculum and teaching mathematics in sixth grade, emphasizing the Games and experience real life experiences, which have been in the district under former Director Clifford Janeyiho, can be attributed to progress NAEP, which was the subject of a report last week.
And I think that we should continue to work and implement the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the level of the class, "said Mrs. Rheeová.
Others said that the results of the NAEP clarify the question of whether Mrs. Rheeová may continue in Svyšování the overall system performance and to provide more money and resources for schools with poor performance, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It's a strong dilemma Mrs Michell Rheeové, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, where she is studying the results of the tests in urban areas.
Conventional the approach is to focus resources and administrative reforms at the school, located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
So the focus of political repercussions, which is directed against the relevant agenda.
But there are, however, of the other city, who is trying to keep the mean diameter between white and black.
We must focus on the creation of a system of large schools.
We must have a relationship of our schools, so that all the family, regardless of where they live, they can rest assured that their children will be given an excellent public schooling.
Mr. Janey, now the director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element of the reduction of the difference between the results achieved, is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to establish the validity of the schools.
You have to get up to 200 days, to be able to push through the changes, said, Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with teachers its association last school year in the length of the 185 days, which considered to be a "flag" for the search for a larger increase in the next year.
To make higher education a part of a better future
Tour bus pulled into the track with a loud.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, got out and rested for a moment on the white columns, brick facades and emerald green grass.
Gracielini parents have completed high school in El Salvador.
Yet Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the land track.
Now she and other students eighth in the group grade exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $a year, their position was rather than by visitors to the enthusiasm of potential students.
Yes! That's it! "she said that would be like to study medicine, when the speaker has offered to enter into the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? "she said thoughtfully, when they revealed a low ratio of professors to students.
The college was one of the seven, who visited on his three-day trip, and now they were fully occupied with the future message: The question is not whether to enter the house.
The question is where.
But this is a problem relating to the high number of children born in the US, Spanish immigrants, who are excluded from the universities or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive a college education and enter into the middle class.
In fact, the "fifth generation" of Spanish students from the college - remarkable achievements indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and people of Central America, came to the United States, without having completed high school.
Their success story is important, the researchers, because it underlines the point the way forward for generation that played a marginal role in the field of the labor of the country.
Those who have reached the higher education, say that a natural náklonpost to the school and the assertiveness and desire to succeed.
Many also had parents who set their children high goals and looking for ways to replace the ignorance of the American education system.
But the school programs also play a special role in helping and millions of children, who would like to track - especially if these efforts in the time persists.
If you take into account that the children come from groups with low incomes, whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them in the system, free from any interference in each individual point will not solve the, says Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We have to think about it, to provide these children safety net of preschool age in all the ways to a high school.
The federal program that funded the trip after the rails, it is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (PřIPTRAVIT), provides more than 300 million dollars a year for the local school systems for the start of training programs, which they used for students from groups with little income to public schools and continue until such students has finished high school.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, of which more than% entered the college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi ministry of oil has reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to get the major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure during the two auctions, which took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements concluded by the Iraqi ministry of oil industry with foreign oil companies, which suggests that the Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the rebuilding of Iraq's oil industry, the decades of war and sanctions.
American companies had left with the participation of just two of 10 fields auctioned.
Seven US companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one has lost bid.
Two U.S. companies have reached agreements on the field, which was announced in June.
The participation of American oil giants in an open Iraqi oil industry, surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the doors after six years of war and American companies here in the first place on the way Asians and Europeans, "said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news service.
It will be a long time before something else will be in Iraq for Sale.
Concerns about safety, highlighted by massive coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday, and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military is likely to discourage American companies from a much more intensive business activities in Iraq, which has the third largest proven reserves of raw materials, analysts say.
American companies have in some cases, at a disadvantage, especially the Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to the risk, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc.. were the only U.S. companies, which have signed agreements with the ministry.
A leading American companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close contacts with the Iraqi ministry of oil industry and offer technical assistance in the past years, left empty-handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom are the top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
The China National Petroleum Corp. participated in the bids on more contracts than any other company, and left with large stakes in two major contracts for the main field.
We all know that China is seeking to become the main economic, as well as technological power, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Oil Industry Assam Jihad.
We believe that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and to honor their commitments to Iraq.
The companies, which have been provisionally selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared to the price of a barrel and the ministry is willing to pay for the strengthening the current output levels in each field.
A planner of al-Qaeda was killed in Pakistan.
When the impact of U.S. missiles at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week was probably killed a top planner of al-Qaeda operations, as announced on Friday by officials of the U.S. counter-terrorism department.
As confirmed, it would be the second fatal attack on one of the top leaders of the terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who were killed when several rockets fell in čtvrtrek on their car near the town of Miran Shah in the province sevverní Waziristan, according to U.S. sources and pakisttánských officials in the area.
Local authorities ounámily that the rockets were launched from the aircraft of type, with which the CIA operates in the illegal indigenous tribes.
They were directed to a white car, which was heading to the Afghan border, when he was hit, said an official with the Pakistani intelligence agency, who was on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that the local militants are swept to the point and quickly zabavilito what was left of the "totally destroyed".
Local authorities have not been able to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. officials have cited an anti-terrorist department of the witness, who said that the Somali was death.
Somali has been cited as a senior planner of military operations, al-Qaeda, who directed the operations of terrorist groups outside the area Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the zosnovávání throughout the world, said a senior official, who did not wish to be named, which featured the sensitive nature of American air strikes on the territory of Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, was probably involved in the attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from al-Qaeda's senior management of and on the basis of these planned possible terrorist attacks.
Another American official said that the Somali rapidly advanced in the hierarchy of al-Qaida and he was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
Not be widely known person for some Americans, but that in no way that before the US and our allies posed, said another official.
When was confirmed his death, Somali should be the second, a senior leader of al-Qaida or the Taliban, who should be killed since September, when he was killed in a similar attack Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of the militant factions in the Gaza indigenous tribes and three other top leaders.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA using unmanned aircraft has decreased since the summer, from an average of approximately six transactions per month to two, according to the Long War Journal, Web sites, managed by non-profit group.
The reduction may be the reason for the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also killing of persons who were suspected of being informers, said Page.
Senior delegate of the United Nations in Kabul.
The senior delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he wanted to withdraw from his resign from his post in March and end a turbulent term, which was thwarted by allegations of widespread corruption in the election of a president in Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
To the left, because the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
Delegate to the UN, said that he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the timetable for the US for a reduction in the state, which starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of the other NATO countries to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the development of Afghan security forces and to send the right signal that they have confidence in the international community, he said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed for the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff to assist in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
On the side of the armed forces must be copied to the civilians, he said.
Eide said he resign, but that's simply fulfills the promise he made to his family in March 2008, in Kabul, spent only two years.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now said that he needed the time for a replacement.
As I said, it is time to look after the Dauphin, "said Eide.
When I came here, there was a vacuum between the two-month leave of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to officials of the UN ban began the search for compensation.
Officials said that will be decided between Staffan di Mistura, who has a Swedish-Italian origin, and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhennem, the Frenchman, who led the UN peacekeeping operations.
The situation in Afghanistan was tested after his former agent, Peter W. Galbraith, who was indicted in September, President Hamid Karzai, who won the presidential election on the masking the presence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied those allegations, but said that the allegations galgraitha - which was released - "definitely harm the mission, because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide said that the proposed meeting with the chief representative of citizens due to the coordination of relief efforts for the leadership of the US forces in Afghanistan.
Also in the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries, which would be for the Afghan mission, because, as he says, he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money is spent properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations of its efforts in Afghanistan and said that the heavy-handed regulation to hire undermine the UN's ability to use the powers.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to get in May, only one person, he said.
This is a disaster, and I cannot continue.
GATES: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose on Iran "significant penalties" because of the lack of engagement in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who was speaking to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during the weekly trip to areas where the war is fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, said in response to an inquiry by a soldier on the likely evolution.
One of the things that depend on me, is that if I learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, [it] is an inherent unpredictability in the war.
The Obama administration will be decided on a package of sanctions, which could affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect the ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and barriers" would require "to persuade the Iranian government to actually feel less safe with nuclear weapons," because "the people will suffer from an" sanctions.
According to Friday's opinion, issued by the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged the European leaders in warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if its nuclear program to full compliance with the UN for nuclear safety and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop their expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In the talks in Geneva on 1 October, indicated that he wants to return to the talks on the reduction of their nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial part of its stocks of enriched uranium in exchange for badly needed fuel for the reactor to the implementation of medical research.
The administration has planted in such an agreement as a way to build confidence between the two parties and to allow time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, is stepping down from the interim agreements - partly because, says the expert, because Irámské leadership is divided about whether to engage in the United States.
Frankly, if the Iranian obstinacy to the international community, in the case of some proposals, which are actually agreed at the In beginning of October, I think it brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese together on a path that is not the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set for December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before returning to the search for other options, including monitoring, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "sanctions".
In its opinion, issued in New York, Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what he called "unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations" against some members of the security committee on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that he wants to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an adequate long-term solutions.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, he met this morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before he flew to the area of Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk, and Kurdish leaders in Irbil.
There is still a high tension between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, in particular because of the border, property rights and the distribution of income.
GTEs urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to zabránlo delay the US plans to reduce the number of American troop from 115000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to dampen the Kurdish concerns from persistent depression. The US official site quoted Gates when he told Massoudu BarzÃ¡anÃ­mu, president of the regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We do not want to leave you. "
In China, change course
Wang and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, which read that "Mother earth is too tired to fund more children" and "one child, also means a grave".
Then came the a lesson that when the official government positions in Shanghai, low birth rate and ageing population in the city, suddenly changed course in the summer, and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: never.
We have always spent all their time and energy to just one child.
We have nothing left for the second, says Wang, 31 years old, Manager of Human Resources, which has 8 měsíčního son.
More than 30 years of China's policy of having only one child has been introduced and thus created two generations, only the notoriously boubelatých and zhýčkaných children, dubbed "little emperors", threatening the country's population crisis.
The average fertility rate dropped to 1.8 children per couple in compared with six than vpolitika vsoupila force, according to the UN.
The distribution of the population, where the number of people aged 60 years and above are predicted to grow from 16.7 percent of the population in the year 2020 to 31, 1 percent in 2050. That is far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is more rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example, in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 years and above accounted for almost 22 percent in Shanghai registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child on the couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Committee on Population and Family Planning said, many couples to have children, to "help reduce the proportion of an aging population and the reduction of the status of the workforce in the future".
He says it's about "being old, it does not mean to be rich - as in developed countries, such as Japan or Sweden."
The gradual
As has been inserted into the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate, established under the rule of the Communist Party.
The pair, who violated the policy, face enormous fines - up to three times their annual salary in some areas - and discrimination at work.
China's official positions advocated policies that helped the country to prevent the exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders were sentenced to enforce the policy.
In rural areas, some officials urged pregnant women in the second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples had to undergo a selective abortion, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, the population officials were progressively less severe in its opinion on the one-child policy.
In 2004, as a rule, permit výce exceptions - including the city of dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and in cases where a man and a woman were only child - and in 2007 to mitigate their passwords, the hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said that officials of the central government has previously debated the more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children, if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city, which launched an aggressive campaign for incitement to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, the posters urge parents to have only one child, replaced with the regulation, describing in detail how it would be legitimate to have a second child, and how to apply for a permit.
The city administration has sent officials to plan families and volunteers, to meet with couples in their houses and vsouvali leaflets under the door.
It also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who have decided to have more than one child.
The response was cool, said officials for planning families.
ZARMUCUJíCí Response
Although officials in a rural town in Shanghai experienced an increase in the interest of couples who would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most urban of the changes.
Urban district with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Frustrated officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign is the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to only about 165 000 - slightly higher than in the year 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng, head of the committee for family planning in Shanghai, said that financial considerations were probably have been the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide the best first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, she said she would like to have two children, and was legally allowed to.
But like many Chinese, who have only a lack of health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without dociální safety nets could be the choice of irresponsible.
People in the West consider the One Child policy is wrong as the disputed legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in association with the first child.
Yes, we were cheated of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It is about money.
Other couples show the psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, manager of human resources, says that they have only one child, because she also was an only child: "We were at the heart of our families, and all of us cared.
We were not used for the provision of care, and in fact we did not want to take care of the other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who own translation company, has put much nepokrytěji.
For the parents of the middle-class, who lowered birth rates, he said, to be successful means to be selfish.
Today's 20 and 30 years growing up my parents is seen as a piercing, the first days číSKéHO experiment with capitalism, and do not want this kind of a living for himself, he says.
Just one child places enormous demands on time parents, he says.
The mother must sacrifice for at least two years of his social life.
Then there are still disputed issues propstoru - "You have to rebuild your apartment" - and strategy - "you must have a resume prepared at a time when the child is 9 months for a good pre-school education.
Most of his friends he wants to be content with one child, says Che, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher standards, he says.
We do not want to make too many victims.
The UN group has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored conference on climate change - largely characterized neukázněnými attitudes and mutual osočováním - again on Friday focused on the release of the document, which proposes ambitious of greenhouse gas reduction over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the immediate term.
The text, which can provide a basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizes the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But it was important to see progress in the negotiations, which took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who will come to Copenhagen next week.
The Working Group created an ad hoc, this text indicates how much money rich countries should provide the poor to cope with global warming in the short term and in the long term.
And provides a full range of options for the key issues, including how to develop and manage the emerging economies in order to reduce their carbon output and what should be the upper limit the increase in global temperature, which political leaders will be able to tolerate.
It's the process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, senior Washington representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who suggested the document abridgement of the 180 pages of text for the meeting to focus on what a top official on issues of climate change at the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
The outlines of the for a possible agreement, in which could be industrial nations to reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, while the major developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period reduced to 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries to reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union discussed on Friday a promise to provide 3.6 trillion dollars over the next three years to help poorer countries to adapt to climate change - from the managing floods and droughts to prevent deforestation.
Still, but on Friday said the same type of verbal fireworks which prevailed at the talks in the last week.
The US special envoy for climate change Todd Stern dismissed the speech, calling for mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries compared with voluntary for the main emerging economies, if not financed by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration a harder line against China, go to the officials of the Bush administration just two years ago.
The United States accedes to the treaty without the transfer of the major developing countries and the implementation of action, "said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to cover the limitations and should be examined by outside observers.
Stern made this comment about an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the main U.S. negotiator on climate issues that either a lack of "common sense" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" led to a week earlier in the statement that the United States would not help financially China to to deal with global warming.
With the future economic path of the world's major powers at stake, both within the developing world, and between the industrialized world and emerging economies.
The current fight is mostly on the conservation of individual economies, rather than the conservation of the planet, between China and the United States on performance of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two of the most influential countries in the world to ignore the scientific imperative for the implementation of stronger action.
Ricardo, a delegate of Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in seeking a way to prevent the large issuers Zak responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game that new economic hegemony is developed, he said, which also serves as a regional adviser in the area of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international protection of nature conservation.
Some of the countries that are most zranitelnelné effects of climate change have indicated that they wish to continue a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the major parties, said that the best result of the talks will be the political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, has created a 24 stránkový draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international negotiations on climate change for of the European Commission, said that the enforcement of the small island nations, "a political tlkak polirtický triggered the whole process," in part because they are now united and demand action from growing economies, such as China and India.
The negotiations led to a new urgency, as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they have most of the remaining contentious issues must be resolved before the Heads of Government compete on the agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as, for example, the Indian minister of environmental protection and the Chinese Deputy Minister out of the aircraft and ran through the halls Bella Center to the closed door meetings and conferences so they could chart a new claims, which will be examined next week.
The vast majority assembly - where 13,000 people a day and from the convention center, the guitar playing activists staged at night ironizující spectacle of the countries, which are believed to be sent, and there were proposals for the transfer from hand to hand on paper rather than by electronic mail - controlled by challenge.
The intensity is only an extension: in Copenhagen were present at almost all of the key ministers and earlier in the center of the 60 heads of state.
We got into the high category, "said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the deputy minister for global policy for international protection of nature conservation.
Heavy weight.
BRITISH first train with a speed of 140 miles per hour this Monday feelings
At 5:13 on Monday morning whistle cut through the darkness as a sign of the departure of the train, which meant a transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country reaches a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford in Kent to London St Pancras and beyond the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and got into the first high-speed passenger trains outside the Llndýn.
He hopes that the new service will join Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and large urban agglomerations of Midland, the North and Scotland, with London.
Neglected stagnant water should shorten transport times in passenger traffic and trade routes and the transition from aircraft and cars on the rail could reduce carbon emissions and to eliminate the congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties in order to get to this vision.
But dozens of Bilin pounds, needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about the environment now constrain the development of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a workable government study, submitted its report to Lord Adonis 30 December, as stated by the Times.
She gave him a detailed map of the route to the next stage of the planned high-speed network.
The new trace links London with the West Midland was designed to five meters in urban areas and neighborhoods, where they would be on the propstředí could be problematic.
In the open countryside was planned to 25 m in the final route.
HS2 is also expected to identify three broad options for high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis answers in the spring.
The preferred option is konfikurace-shaped y, with one high-speed line should lead to the West Midland.
The track should share with one near the Birmingham branch, passing through the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and the other, leading to the northeast in Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over the Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like that it was the most effective choice," he said a railway expert.
As soon as this is done, journey times between London and Edinburgh is reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first phase, which will not open before the year 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham for 49 minutes, compared with more than one hour in the present.
Proposals should allow trains to run at a speed of 2250 miles per hour, which would make the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route has been proposed so as to carry trains in the length of the 400 m, which would be able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the route LONDON - birmingham.
That means that, in the London terminal would be able to serve the needs of up to 20,000 passengers per hour.
Due to capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be expanded so as to the high-speed network.
Experts from železničníhoprůmyslu argues that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether means or does not intend to implement this scheme, but the extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that is not a final decision before the general election.
Even if the wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should be first put into service on the high-speed lines, but the existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is regarded as a crucial point of contact for the transition from the aircraft to trains, a reference point for the Revolution on the rail.
Taxpayers pay the mortgage of 75,000 pounds on Tories
Alan Duncan, the holder of the chair-front benches in the House of Commons taxpayers pay the thousands of pounds cost last year for orangery, which has built in his home in the electoral district.
A spokesman for the prison, which was demoted by David Cameron that he complained that MPs were living "in the", increased their mortgage to 75,000 to build an oak-paneled, in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, overall, hundreds of pounds a month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities have agreed to demands on time and so he was questioned by Sir Thomasen Legge, who control of the Member States. Last night, Mr Duncan said their requirements "to be cleaner and simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns two houses in the village in his electoral district Rutland and Melton.
Houses have a value of about a million pounds.
The ground floor has a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the tax office agreed, that Mr Duncan needs more space.
Last year, added to the house the Winter Garden, which is in the plan as "marked".
Neighbors describe her as "a greenhouse for fun and entertainment".
Mr. Duncan was asked to provide an explanation for the increased loan during the last inspection committee for the municipal standards and privileges in the final settlement of the mortgage.
The committee told him last month that broke the rules, after a review of its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed for a mortgage of 271406 pounds from his estate in London at a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week, showed that Mr Duncan claimed about 1,400 pounds a month in mortgage interest up until March last year.
In April, his claims have increased to more than 1,800 pounds a month.
RBS mortgage interest of Mr Duncan could not change at this time, which suggests that all this was intended to finance a loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard variable mortgage RBS fell in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of this year, with the left.
The last document municipal authorities show that Mr Duncan continued to claim 1250 per month in May this year.
Mr. Duncan has left his job as shadow leader of the House in September, after a secret one, and said that members must survive "on rations" after the expenses scandal.
"Basically, it's, you have to live on the allocation and treated you like s**t."
He said: "I spent money on my garden and claim a small fraction of what had to be done.
And I could claim the full share of the Damned, but I will not. "
The MP, a millionaire from the former career as a businessman with crude oil, was first asked to explain their release in May, when it became clear that claimed thousands of pounds for your garden, before the approval of the tax authority that it "can be regarded as excessive".
One of the activists had dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign in the lawn of Mr Duncan to protest after he revealed that claimed 4,000 pounds for a period of three years.
When he was asked last night to increase the mortgage, Mr Duncan said: "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the tax authority and then subsequently legge."
He added: "It is not a question of hiding and dribbling or violations of the rules or something else.
It's absolutely a straight line down, according to the rules, and that's all.
It would be many other Spůsoby cleaner and simpler. "

He said: "We want to make religion more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why do we as a church to expect that people will come to the old building? I have a feeling that the church should come to the people and serve way.
"The idea of Advent calendar in shelters was just like an interview with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and a vibrant place, and we tried to try and present the spiritual path. "

However, in any case, funds jer, said the secretary-general UFAP, Jean-François forget.

But 15th criminal court also ordered the medical examination of 87 year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which should make the college of three doctors.
The heiress and the main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such testing, certainly not on the terms offered by the state prosecutor in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors, who will be elected on Friday, should draw up a report on 10th March 2010 and at the same time to comment, whether she could be in a state of weakness, and in which the period.
I think that it will.
The things I talk to her, said after the hearing Mrs Bettencourtové lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
As far as the lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
It's good news (...). Expertise shows that with this old lady, who needs protection, manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
The two years ago, the only daughter Liliane Bettencourt opened criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banierovi, photographer and Všeumělci, whom they blame for years are using the state of weakness of her mother, in order to gain a the gift of one billion euros in the form of checks, contracts for life insurance or images.
But Liliane Bettencourt always refused, that it would be a photographer, which considers as a long-term friend, manipulated.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of an action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday's the speech of lawyers are sometimes changed in the Family Hour of Truth.
The attorney Liliane Bettencourt submitted three letters to his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to its notaries, and in which they expressed their distrust of her husband-Françoise Bettencourt Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, according to Liliane Bettencourt lawyer, adds: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote for a period of 15 years, once or twice a day.
Ever since you got married, I never talk ".
The state prosecutor in Nanterre again found that the Complainant's conduct was not justified, the more that, in these days of the judge rejected its request for the initiation of a proceeding to the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt is fully able to participate in the court, is not under the protection of or in custody.
No one else for it not to act' representative, confirmed the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigneyová.
Finally, the Court held that the validity of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers expressed at the time of the start of the process.
The Revolution or the end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence was unnecessary.
For more than ten years of the behavior of the management of large company employees business-access to to the consumer marketing BEFORE THE REVOLUTION: The point is to co-identify themselves with the "values" identified from the mountain, as was the case before, when it was necessary to impose on consumer products which have the ideas of heads of factory technicians.
The fact that the customer has become a center of entrepreneurial companies, marketing strategy the market revolution in the right direction ... even if attempts to impose authoritarian on the products of different from customer preferences, returning back!
Passive attitude of the staff can lead to death.
SUICIDES IN at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the visible part of a much more general phenomenon, which affects mostly managerial cadres.
The demobilization adversely affects the development of all the functions of the company, including research and development, and, more importantly, the economic intelligence.
And, indeed, ei "requires from all interested parties (...) the active approach and the ability to anticipate" and requires from the staff of the commitments which are completely at odds with the revenue authoritarian management.
Therefore, we call on the managerial revolution, which was designed to bring workers at the center of the interest of the company as well as a client.
The relative usefulness of internal surveys of public opinion.
Internal public opinion polls - as the questionnaire submitted by the employees of the company Orange - will contribute to the revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I convinced myself that in the face of the new situation, the structure of the various turning back, to do what you always do!
Furthermore, because of authoritarianism, as one of the power, increases in proportion to the severity of their own failures.
And finally, because most of the workers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of Engineers, have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of convenience of thought acquired by the old behaviorist theory, Re-Animated "again" from the US and widely disseminated without greater knowledge of scientific institutes and the media.
In fact, it is possible to move the "levers" (sic) the involvement of managers, showed a recent survey agency Ipsos Figaro. On the site, which only strengthens the management personnel in the position of a mechanical procedure, unsuitable for today's world.
To identify and measure the factors of mobilization.
On the contrary, the revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, for the adoption of the definitive vision of human behavior.
Lies in the integration of the basic insight into all the projects and practice management: for the staff of the commitments to the company will be possible only if they seem like a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of the motivation of employees engaged in the only study of functional analysis.
These studies have shown that their businesses on the basis of the predetermined Doxy, which will allow them to the image, which the company says, look at what gives them to realize their life goals.
Thanks to identify and measure of these factors can the managers to control, predict and pre-empted on their "social power" and its management of human resources, "on the right path".
This creates a breeding ground for the development of a sound and effective economic intelligence.
Manifestation of the Oslo: "just war" Obama has earned praise from the right.
The American right-wingers on Friday welcomed a speech that Barack Obama made the day before in Oslo, satisfied with the fact that the holder of the Nobel Peace Prize for the year 2009, defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who initially laughed at the price of Obama, 9th October, this time a presidential speech applauded, including Sarah Palin, the former vice-presidential candidate in elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, she said Palin, muse of right-wing Republican, for the newspaper USA Today, and added that she herself on the subject "sometimes necessary" war, expressed in his memoirs, which are based.
The war is, of course, the last thing the Americans would want to have to work, but it is necessary.
All the terrorists there to be detained, he said.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after its George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo, justify the deployment of forces and used the speech to explain his decision to send another 30 000 troops to Afghanistan for nine days before.
Another Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, said that the president did in Oslo "a very good job."
I think that the speech was very good, congratulated the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which especially appreciated the president's mention of "The existence of evil in the world.
In a way, I thought the speech as of historical, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former member, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the presidential elections in 2012, was thrilled to see "a leftist president," the members of the Committee for the Nobel Prize, "that they would not be free and could not pass the price for peace, if the use of force."
According to Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, now editor of The Washington Post, Obama made a "very American".
Not only is presented as a "the", but as always, "he said as an American President" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble, which themselves they created, and that they do too much for it to keep," Gerson said.
Among the few malcontents from the right to hawk the Bush era, a former ambassador to the UN John Bolton, who has described the speech as "dull, turgid and without inspiration," as stated on the website of the National Review Online.
The left of the president, for example the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is appalled at the sight of Barack Obama to, justifies the use of force.
"When the war packed into a container of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, moderate-leftist press is of the of the president of opinion.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to be the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for Obama early, his output as "nadvýkon" and even speaker known for his talent.
Speech the Oslo Accords should serve as a guide to international decisions in resolving conflicts, in the fight against poverty and oppression ", according to the California newspaper.
Obama "of what was said to be", said the New York Times, and a sign labeled "for the simple and instructive."
Road carriers: three marathons to the agreement, which will save the supply of stocks for Christmas.
After three negotiating ran out of road transport departments and the trade unions', the only of employers, which remained until the end, on Friday evening to the agreement that ended the call to strike and the threat that hung over the supply of stocks for Christmas.
The secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau on Friday's signing of the agreement expressed "joy" and that after several negotiations, which began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions, negotiators on Friday early morning broke up with in the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
And in spite of the fact that the three employers' organizations (FNTR, UNOSTRA, wipe) withdrew from the negotiations.
But it was the need for more than six hours of meetings, which began at 11 hours, that all agreed and in 18 hours of the agreement.
This conflict "would be very hurt" and "there would be a danger that they will be distorted by the holidays at the end of the year," he said.
The text includes wage increases of 4% for the lowest salaries (for local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for those with the highest salaries (international transport).
Hourly wage for the lowest salary increases from EUR 8.72 to 9.06.
It's not much, but it's a lot of effort, he explained Patrice Clos (for).
Tonight we'll give our members, in order to avoid blockades, no blockade of supply centers.
But it may occur a few opponents, who are not satisfied, "he said.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed the "good agreement", although it was difficult to grant the increase salaries due to the international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of EUR 170 per month for the lowest wages and about 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a deal of common sense and respect for employees, said Cmaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) has welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jauberta (CGT) is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also envisages upgrading travel expenses of 3% and a report on the situation of the state road transport in the first half of the year 2010, which will also focus on the question of 13 salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Bussereau said "a reduction of EUR 100 million euros in taxes from the wages of,' which was the subject of the amendment to the government on the draft budget law for the year 2009, to vote in the night of Thursday to Friday the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to "identical" vote.
Signature provides that this agreement will apply as soon as possible to the businesses that are members of the organization, then the entire field, in the case of an extension of the Ministry of Labor.
Take place "as soon as possible," he said.
The whole process can hinder the only opposition of employers.
The organization FNTR speaks of "bad business" for 100 million euros "have already been offered in the sector, offsetting the carbon tax."
The secretary of state for transport, forced us to emergency meeting not as a result of an analysis, but to make the turkey at the time of the approaching Christmas holidays, she complained.
For the organization, the danger is that the agreement in the next 12 months "bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field".
RER suburban trains A: interruption of traffic on the weekend, trade unions, with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
The interruption of traffic on the line of suburban RER trains, which is the largest urban public transport in France, will continue over the weekend, because Friday's meeting between the unions and management on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in otázcežádosti the premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, on the important shopping weekend before Christmas, will be trains only between 10 and 20 hour, on the main section (between La Defense and the nation) will run every second train, out of this section of only one train in four.
A link with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre, and passengers will be forced to transfer to another train.
Galeries Lafayette department stores, which expect every day, over 200 000 customers welcomed the fact that "The RATP sought to zajištěníspojení with large department stores.
The RER line and goes from the West to the east of Paris.
Managed by the RATP section goes from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-la-Vallée.
On Friday, he was the in the top of one train of two, and virtually any combination in the go during off-peak hours, as planned.
On Thursday, the inhabitants of the Ile de France and arranged for other platforms nevládl confusion.
So early in the morning was in the station Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) far fewer people than usual, inter alia, also because the pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, the engineer, 29 years from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he stood for "an hour and a half early to be sure they arrive in time".
Saint-Lazare railway station was crowded, said state railway SNCF, predicted with the larger number of prisoners and guards.
RER commuter trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or in Cergy-le-haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare railway station with connection to the subway.
, the General Assembly will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will evaluate the results of Friday's afternoon meeting with management, trade unions, which rank as "weak".
The proposed negotiations on a special protocol for the suburban RER trains and in all respects, the organization of working time, the career progress.
, however, that is not the drivers, who require a well-earned premium, according to Thierry Garon (ODBORYJIH).
RATP even being delayed by the bonuses, which offend the CGT, with that the leadership "was not able to solve the problem, while travel operators SNCF and it".
The new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "closer to review the conditions of the profession," the RATP transport companies.
Which was the reason why trade unionists believe that the company "makes fun of passengers".
In the morning hours about 150 drivers occupied the works committee in his Paris headquarters.
Leadership, which until now rejected any discussion during the strike, is therefore, in the interest of to "reassure" opted for the meeting.
There is a danger that the conflict on Tuesday extended the RER B line, after UNSA and independent notify the emergency.
The unions for a premium in value from the 120 (UNSA) to EUR 150 euros, of which EUR 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, SUD (South), thermal (independent)) and make it difficult for the deteriorating working conditions on this route, which carries a million passengers a day.
Drivers of suburban RER trains in the more advanced the time career from 2200 to 2700 euros from 600 to 650 gross wages and bonuses for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice for the Kurdish party, and this decision brings with it grave consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday decided to cancel the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. The decision immediately triggered a protest demonstration in the Kurdish community in south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the task of government, which is trying to provide to the Kurdish community of a friendly hand to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it has become "a hive activities against the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said the president of the supreme court Hasim Kilic told reporters, after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, for the dissolution of the most-needed seven votes, he said, adding that 37 of party cadres, including its president, Ahmet Turk and Aysely Tuglukové the prohibition to participate in political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, which was used by Mr and Mrs Tugluková and confiscation of property by the Ministry of Finance.
The party has 21 seats in parliament (out of 500).
The party leadership has indicated before verdict that members would prefer to leave the parliament than it served as members of no political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of a process initiated in 2007, the Court of Cassation Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkayem, which accuses the DTP of obedience to the "orders" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legal political showcase rebels from the PKK.
The assures that the PKK has no link "essential", but refuses to designate a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes at a time when the government is the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a range of measures to strengthen their rights, and attempts to limit the support of Kurds against the PKK and to end the conflict.
The DTP executives confirmed that the dissolution of the parties could lead to a renewal of tensions in the southeastern Anatolia, where in recent weeks, many demonstrations against the conditions under which the detained PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan in clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the decision of justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front seat of the DTP in Diyarbakir, a major city in the southeast, which inhabited by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, the demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or and fired stones from slings.
Also in Istanbul, about a hundred people.
After delivery of the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of justice "will deepen despair.
Turkey is not the question (the Kurds,. red.) to resolve the ban, said in the press.
The government, consisting of a party came from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are in principle against the interference of the parties.
It does not solve anything, said Minister for Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is an absolute shooting Democratic proposals, which were initiated by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can wait for a reaction from the PKK, he said.
On Thursday, the PKK subscribed to one of the most deadly attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed three days earlier, seven soldiers.
The new silicon-valley
For years, was paid for a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, it was closely guarded site, where there is a secret weapons research.
Today, it is considered to be the district with 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers away from Moscow's Center, the "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are placed significant micro-and nanoelectronics research and manufacturing centers.
Since September 2008 established zelenogradští contacts with the representatives of the scientific center Riedberg - with university institutions and firms FRANKFURT Innovation Center (FIZ).
There have been a number of mutual visits and signed Wednesday in Frankfurt and the Protocol on the "close cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow mayor Yuri Rosljak and prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, Frankfurt, head of the planning officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, they will go and representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in research at a seminar in Zelenograd.
The scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Fizu companies will be allowed to take in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, the Russian scientific companies want to get the contract in Germany.
It is home to major Russian research institutes and companies.
These should include the Moscow Institute of Technology, large corporations and Sitronics Rossiyskaya electronics.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (the literal translation of "Green City") received its name from the wooded hilly landscape, which they are placed in research facilities.
Stuttgartská Brake
Dimension Stuttgart 21 simply cannot adequately prepare.
For fans of the project, it is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
Well. It is more than running of the station, more than a monstrous building, which throws the capital Baden-Württemberg for a decade in the building of chaos.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 80's.
Head station with the tracks, which ended in the center of the city, were then considered to be in the 19th century, which acts as a brake modern rail transport, because it was the need for much of time to přepřáhnutí locomotives from back to front.
Go, stop for a moment, to go on - so it should work.
And that's why the station: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies roughly in the middle of the route of trans-European rail track between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of "The heart of Europe".
Indeed, starting with S21, although the vision of the 1980's are no longer compatible with reality.
Ourselves very ambitious designers know that THE, and Bavarian city is the start of construction almost neufinancovatelné.
Since then, as there are modern shuttle trains and motor vehicles at both ends, they don't station have problems with the Zajížděním and Vyjížděním.
Yet: It starts with the Stuttgart 21, including a new track to ice Ulm.
Asserting that the prefects and local politicians.
, together, and because of the greatest risk of individual infrastructure project in the republic is borne by the taxpayer and not the state concern.
The project is still some way to apologize.
A new urban space, which - if we are to believe the computer images of designers - will contain a lot of green.
For rail transport system is S21.
The station, and the construction of the line are designed for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980's - attributed the huge increase.
Then there was no competition from cheap flights.
A modern transport policy must go but first and foremost on the strengthening of freight transport, because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than freight car on the road.
But the new line is not due to a sharp climb suitable for freight trains.
Even more important is that the S21, indirectly affects many other railway projects.
In should be a good six billion euros.
This is the official number.
Experts consider to be the real Ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade will lack the funds to the other nodal points and bottlenecks in the network.
On the list of the Ministry of Transport is a major projects.
One of the most important is the construction of approximately 180 kilometers long route through the valley of the Rhine.
Since 1987, on this route is slow pace.
There would be need to really push.
But it will be as a brake.
The track the Rhine Valley becomes a neck bottle of international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.

The minister rejected the complaint Posch Schäfer-Gümbel, the provincial government is trying to through the "Law and tricks" to get to their night flights.

To get to Germany and out of is nice, almost no control ... "is the opening line of a poem by Poet Werner Söllnera, which in this torn piece of linguistic experience with a přicestováním one dissident, who won freedom at the same time, but also lost their linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in a Romanian banátu, he worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and, later, as one of the children's book publishing, 1982 and then moved to Frankfurt am Main.
He was awarded the different prices, 1993 taught poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002, is head of the literature in Frankfurt.
The great commotion took care of last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, where they were "German literature in Romania in the mirror and a mirror its security act".
Obviously, and left a Söllner Declaration, in front of the writers Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totokem, Franz Hodjakem and Helmuth Frauendorferem, accords to work as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the present Söllner won in 1989, the German language prize.
Attempts at said he began quietly, first in 1971.
I said, "Well, someone who did not sufficiently attempts at intimidation by the Securitate."
The Poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize and its unparalleled literary settlement with mechanisms of dictatorial government's literary scene, and particularly a community German authors originating in Romania, shaken by case, which indicates the depths and political system, which is based on the control and špicování.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said in the present state of knowledge, only the offender, but is also a victim.
In the Securitate secret agent Walter played a role, said after the award of Michael, and referred to a positive influence on the secret agent Walter.
"Vysekával" me that in all the important points for him, he says.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
The SöLLNEROVO statement was in this form, and before the audience unexpected, but not very surprising return of former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is.
Herta Müller wrote in July, when the reading their own deeds, 914 parties, that Germany was a nice reserve for the Securitate.
Concerned, it can be assumed, to be speculating, and in some cases probably know that the name is hidden behind the code name Sorin, Voicu, and it also Walter.
Otherwise than in the domestic market, has since become a look at some components of the, is handling the estate control Securitate still very diffuse.
In the past few years, has been systematic education and restricted.
One of the BIRTHLEROVýCH offices, which corresponds to the National Council for processing components of the Securitate (CNSAS), was founded in 1999, the issue of the act took place, since more lengthy.
Only since 2005, there is a law that governs the management of folders.
That former members of the Securitate in Romania have still a big influence, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller a conversation in which one of the former bosses of the Timisoara, commented on the awards.
He has said psychosis, after all, was questioned only once.
Power here quite openly expressed in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, that is not the case, as in the context of the guilt, is the inevitable questions.
Why now? Who is hurt? specific audience responses to the söllnerovo of leaves to expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge, rather than those the guilt and shame.
The genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it's more than a footnote.
With the Champions League
It looked as if he came clean clothes agent of from a Christmas party, where the sporting goods manufacturer distributing sweets, he took a quarter an hour after midnight the Mercedes C Class Vfbr a new coach Christian Gross, accompanied by orange-colored bag sponsor.
The man with the ball that left for him after he had brought him, even in a foreign city.
Otherwise it could drive alone - Alcohol is not in the game, and drunk with happiness was 55 letý man also little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow we will continue to work.
Or is it just begins.
In the words of a committed only three days from Switzerland: "Although we have reached the fourth round, in the Champions League thanks to VÃ½hÅe3: 1 over Unirea Urziceni in Romania," but we must not let the oslnit success: It's a brutally tough fight against the descent. "
"Far more important task" is in front of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in the exercise of the royal class and in ordinary league date.
And to avoid the obvious weaknesses of three fast gólech maricy (5), träsche (8) and (11).
Sortition
Round of Champions League (game 16/17. + 23/24 February / retaliation Match 9. 10. + 16/17 March) will draw lots for the 18th December in Nyon.
The joy of třeskavého taking babbelova successor will therefore be maintained.
Not only for the alleged healer is uncertain the professionals said during a short period of self-confidence, willingness to deploy and joy of the game.
I went to the players, and told them that they focus on their own strengths, and I told them to be more adventurous, explained the souls of Gross as simple-sounding successful recipe which, but for the action of a therapist babbela but he did not have any effect.
Spurred by a magic, admitted Babbelův Jens Lehmann, "when in football a new momentum, they become sometimes things that you did not see it possible."
A Sami Khedira and, who after a break caused by injury, became, thanks to its dynamism as the best player on the pitch, he tried to describe the "Phenomenon" proverbial "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new boss: "He is a man who is a radical and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
In Babbel's obviously missing.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet been saved, warns sports the president Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs but more stability.
They want neither as gross players and managers to overestimate the victory against a weak substitute and defense of the Romanian guest.
Would have won even in Glasgow before an ugly awakening came after the defeat, 0-4 in Leverkusen, considering Khedira.
And the president, Horst Heldt reminded that it has achieved one objective in the season, but the other is still far away.
We're not out of the woods.
That Heldt on its 40th celebrate birthdays even after the first domestic victory after three months, was due to the events, which recently revived in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the game.
Decisions, which the than others, and not Jens, said Heldt on Hard's criticism.
The board of directors of weak leadership and decided to change the coach after pressure of fans.
And the fact that it was his day off after game, Lehmann described as a sign of the lack of sovereignty and envy.
"Net egoism," he said, and announced consequences for goalkeepers.
Both will have probably no longer the joy of life.
In any case, they are the one with the other, that without the work of deposed Trenérského team would not be so strong and the' performances.
Babbel and his aides were "a large share of success," says, and Lehmann unanimously - and a man with a plastic bag agrees.

Case
The attack from the opposition: the green JÃ¼rgen Trittin called because of bad information about the affairs, minister of defense as a liar.
The SPD and the Linke (Left) chancellor invited to submit an explanation.
Hamburg / BERLIN - according to the latest knowledge to the raid on the opposition believes that the Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Minister for the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "knowingly false", said the head of the green Jürgen Trittin in Saturday news show ARD "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual expression: he lied.
The order for the killing was issued in breach of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the message, which was NATO, he had read Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became clear that the attack was not only the destruction of the hijacked truck, but the targeted killing of two leaders of the Taliban.
When the American bombing, which has claimed the German commander, Colonel Klein, according to NATO to kill or injury to 142 people.
Greens, the SPD and the Linke called on Saturday the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately expressed before the Assembly and also clarify what he really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether it is part of a strategy of targeted killings of Afghan policy of the Bundestag - and, if the office of chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence of this new strategy adopted, Jürgen Trittin called a colleague from the Green Party Renate Künastová.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The office of chancellor has no effect on the actual deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, also voiced doubts about the makeup of the Ministry of the background to the release of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wicherta.
According to the information from to inform both Guttenberg correctly and completely on the background of the attack on the tank.
It was said that they had to deny the existence of the reports of NATO and the Minister sensitive details.
From both the number of top officials, however, said that the ministry of defense, even a several reports, among them the two-page document commanding Colonel Klein and one report of the military police.
"Frankfurter Sonntagszeitung" report that Wichert, meanwhile, requested in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that has not yet received no response.
The ministry on Saturday did not comment on complaints and pointed out that this will be addressed in the investigative committee of the Federal Assembly, which will be appointed next Wednesday.
The world of dreams
Some see in the the images and hear voices that others see and hear.
Not only was mentally ill or in the drug boundaries between imagination and reality.
Until this occurs during sleep, everything is all right.
If we lie to shut our eyes in a dark room, we may surround the wildest imagination and delusions.
But who is experiencing in vigilance dream-like states, sees and hears things that others don't see and hear, in today's of the Western world for a fool or a drug dependent, or at least as a result.
But such images and voices that do not produce only the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication.
The blame is our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, here and there, to take care of that blend the border between dream, vision and reality.
Dreams of altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, at best, we call them a vision, at worst, delusional.
Even when the initiator and the effect may vary, however, the vision of Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of the prophet new-age Carlos Castaneda, shamanic States mania, psychosis and hallucinations derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions arise in the event of a derailment of balance of neuronálních brain - particularly the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - and interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
A comprehensive hallucinations, and wandering thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has him no power.
The link between the delusions of employed and philosophers and doctors since antiquity.
Aristotle understood as a form of, a dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, said in 1861 "The great similarity with dream states," the Sigmund Freud was a dream even "psychosis, with all the nonsense, delusion, deception of the Senses".
It is the autumn of 2001, Henning T. as the comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and bright color.
Gravity over him have no power, floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels the kick.
Behind him, a winged figure with the red blood, his teeth.
Chasing him, kick him in the heavy, shoes, throwing him on the wall, feel the pain throughout the body.
There is a loud, the voices of the walls and on the radio.
We cannot tolerate the voices that curse and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, zauzlí it into a loop and put it on a hook on the ceiling.
Stand up to one speaker and you can loop around the neck.
Jumping.
Loop.
Learn, a chorus of voices tearing his eardrums, "Go to a clinic to be treated!"
Today it is T. is 40 years old, has had six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first in nearly 20 years ago.
They were started LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoafektivní paranoid psychosis, it is also, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with their disease, three years is married.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fears and doubts, he says.
The ghosts are a horrible reality
About one percent of people get sick at least once in a lifetime schizophrenia in psychiatric clinics, is the second most commonly depression treatment of disease.
In the acute schizophrenic psychosis are not affected most of them cannot distinguish between internal and external world, moving into the condition, which can lead to hallucinations, velikostním, illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Especially widespread is hearing voices - voices that command, comment or maintain dialogue.
Neither optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The victim is unable to distinguish important from unimportant, the brain cannot filter out spurious signals, consciousness is flooded with emotions.
As well as a dream opens the floodgates to a barrage of ideas and fantasies, which come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the body, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor, clinic General Psychiatry university clinic in Heidelberg.
A schizophrenic is located in the center of the stage, everything has meaning directed at him.
At the same time, into a passive role, it happens, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and can actively shape.
It is therefore often feel threatened, manipulated and controlled.
Comparison with reality is not usually possible with them, the ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is out of the question.
Once in a lifetime experience
Otherwise than in a dream, says, "but still sensual and spatial structure of the fact that one sees in psychosis, a well-preserved."
The wandering thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation and experience in a real framework.
Scientists are still the puzzle as to why our brain is doing exactly the sort of stuff.
The exceptional conditions for each person may lead to the fact that in the short-term will lose relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone, however, develop into psychosis.
It seems that there is a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that disabled people have a minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stage of development, damage the maturation of the brain, such as viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy, says Fuchs.
But it remains a puzzle, as there is a failure of the system, which in doing so for years does not materialize.
Play a role by the effects of the area - Stress or traumatic experiences can be, if it is to her disposition.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, because the transmission system.
When our brains
The crazy is that psychotronici suffers from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, and an expensive medication, while others give money for drugs to be obtained, he said, a professor of psychology Erich Kasten Lübeck.
If the images we perceive as a pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten collector for ten years, reports of hallucinations and delusions, in the last year interpreted their results in the book "Die Welt irreale in unserem Kopf" (the world in our head).
Although hallucinations are a typical accompanying phenomena psychoses, but also to the surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to the psychological disorders such as depression borderline personality or also often like a migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, and the brain of a healthy human.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consists of the contents of ideas, which are normally suppressed.
Arise, when part of the brain, which processes sensory perception, are too active or little repressed; if our brains, or the lack of stimulation.
Drugs can run this state as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of stimulus, stress, worry about love or other more exceptional conditions.
In the most recent studies, and one third of respondents had reported that at least once in your life experienced a hallucination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and walk to a nearby school.
In fact, a normal girl.
If there were those shapes and voices.
The breaks, may be that it will to hulk with long, dark hair.
When he replies, looking at her classmates with a surprise - no one except her to see and hear the boy.
This shy girl as a dreamer, but Sarah K. dreams, knows it.
He is awake, hears and sees the boy, exactly as they hear and see the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
Even he can feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, is like the boy.
I'm crazy?, sometimes asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and disappears.
In the night are rather disappointing.
They are often a burden.
When sitting in the class, not how many times following the teaching, as a teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new classmate, but he said while all other audible and visible on the board of mathematical equation.
In the night are rather depressing.
While waiting in his dark room to sleep, which is rarely and too late, often cannot distinguish whether it is awake or if she was asleep, if the images he sees,, or a girl with bleeding wounds on the hands and feet from her open or eyes closed.
Leave me alone, yelling at the characters.
Parents and Friends say anything about it, people would talk about her, that's crazy.
The autumn of 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year she graduated high school graduation and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations ceased.
Since that time she contacted on the Internet, a psychologist, knows exactly that crazy.
The images are also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or had removed incentives will have a likely hallucinations, says Kasten.
I believe that the brain does not have enough work and himself for his own amusement.
Sarah K., an only child, was like a little girl, fear of the other children, often playing herself.
The hallucinations began, when he was 13, she learned that the man who called my dad from the days when she thinks is her own father.
Because the visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that process the real images and sounds, it's for people like Sarah K. difficult to distinguish from one another delusion and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, the reality shows there.
There are also images that allow the brain,, so the real work. "
Also the night dreams evaluates Kasten as a form of delusion.
Hallucinations healthy people does not differ fundamentally from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Compared to the are psychologically healthy people are able to identify their errors as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advise their patients to evaluate the hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The border state between dreams and hallucinations.
In our world the concentrated too much on the consciousness is an imaginary experience, unfortunately, Patologizován, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and the Chief Psychiatric Hospital and Clinic Florence-Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is heavy, a disease, but it also provides positive, creativity - a mirage is also the art of despair.
Schmidt Degenhard studied the so-called "form of experience, a special form of the consciousness to dream.
Oneiroidní States are highly complex, detailed fictional Dreams, which is considered to be the real issue and cannot even re-distinguished from the state.
The state of consciousness arises in the extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as inflammation polyradikulárním patients who experience the full knowledge motor paralysis.
When one is threatened by the loss of the world and herself, to be continued, complete inability to move, is replaced by the real life-threatening situation, your own, an imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The status of the border between dreams and hallucinations.
Because in reality it is not possible to deal with any situation, there is a change in the worlds, the real situation but Zpřítomní idea.
The intensive form of aid and the transfer of the senses in some senses an intolerable situation, which allows people to their own ability to shape, move in an instant loss of consciousness.
All of this is real, and later in the memories
Also, the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his experiences in his book "The Exchange" (heart) as a rescue mission.
He was 49 years old, when, after the heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplantation published his consciousness on several days, with his body lay motionless in intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into a world, which he created, visited foreign time and place: It is the old man on the bed in a sanatorium train, a robot on his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, the nobility, which produces narcotic substances from the blood.
On a kidnaps it THE bike to their homeland, in a hospital bed in the Alps, and meets the Korean Goodfellas.
Completely immersed in the imaginary wrong, everything is real, and later in memory.
These internal journey for the fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a different state, describes his experience.
In contrast to dreams are memories of those mental disorders after many years and non-essential details clearly obvious.
Even clearer and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of the experience of the horizon of our other opravdivých experience, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, the show oneiroidní States, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile are also in our internal images of external reality.
Any change in the status of consciousness, summarises the psychologist Kasten, "may lead to distortion of what we call reality."
The fact that may also be enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
In the 27 to take over the children.
The new head of publishing house is a temporary solution: the long-term he wants to Hubert Burda to hand over their business in the hands of their two children, said Der Spiegel.
Holding is also in the future include 100 percent family.
HAMBURG - publisher Hubert Burda see their business in the long term in the hands of their children.
Both children will inherit in 27 years and have a strong will to join the company, says the man 69 letý Spiegel.
Details are to solve carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company, is considered later.
The question is whether they have the ability.
It is not possible to take the 7500 employees their children if they are not sufficiently capable of.
That would have killed the children and business.
Burda on Thursday announced that from january withdraws from the presidency of the board of directors, and appointed as his successor, Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen 52 years old since 1999 is a member of the board of directors.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the added responsibility for the company's assets and following the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfera the direct marketing, foreigners, printing and finance.
For the first time at the head of any of the members of the family.
Burdovým children are 19 and 17 years, his son, Felix, which would today be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment also serves to make a "10, 15 years," he said.
Holding should in the future include 100 percent family, says Burda.
With regard to the cases, and, the Schaeffler Burda expressed that neither the family businesses do not have the confidence before the agency: "It's always companies that they had been infected by a desire for capital, which have speculated and thought that they could become great players.
It has never been my strategy.
He never had "dreams of a world power," says Burda.
Preceptor see as a political system of the country, as Springer, and I do not want to play the World League with "Time", these shops are too big.
Promise Fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, only serves to view the mail, without the ability to view a certain type of attachments or surfing the Web.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US, when Time magazine praised it as one of the products of the year.
It is difficult to see out there, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the Peek is characterized by very low price and the monthly payments, less than half the amount, for example, the data plan for the iPhone.
After its success, the company has started offering two new devices: One is designed exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of continuous provision of free data service, for which, it is necessary to pay for six times the amount.
Fonpeek yesterday, which was presented to the Web site, is the European version of the invention and at the same time, his third transformation.
Is limited, as well as his American counterpart, but brings a surprise.
The monthly cost for maintenance is around 12 euros a month and includes roaming across Europe.
People passengers, already know what it means to lose the data services after crossing the border or eagerly looking cafe with WiFi (or FON connection), so that they can see the mail.
The idea of rooming with a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should be put in place a long time ago.
Yes, some companies have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses, to read the tiny letters.
The European Commission has requested to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that such a device as Fonpeek (It is interesting that still has the name FON, he does not have Wifi) accomplishes this type of fare, means that operators are beginning to think differently and considering the various offers, Kterýmiby compensate for its data network.
Kindle is another fine example, offers downloads of books and other searches on the Internet.
No contract, no complications.
This device is connected and paid the purchase, rather than for months.
And that's exactly what I expect that one případěfonpeek occurs, it is a possibility to purchase with permanent access to the Peek has already been introduced in the US.
Not because I wanted to buy it.
I'm going through the mail, on the phone, thank you.
I expect it, because I think that it's from the consumer's point of view, the best type.
It would be interesting if the same system he used in a computer.
Color, Kterouzbožňuje Michelle
Yellow is clearly a favorite color of the first lady.
For Barack Obama for the office of US president chose to dress and coat in the color, the same color can also be chosen, when it was on the second most important moment of his life: the transmission of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: In addition, that it is a similar color - green with effects-in both cases, it was a three-piece ensemble - clothes, bags and coat of the same substance --embroidered or decorated with large collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States has decided to follow in the footsteps of Princess of Asturias and wear similar clothes.
The substance, which is made of clothes, both models very different.
On the occasion of taking office, Michelle used a large, in Oslo velvet with printing.
Amend and add: green shoes with medium-high Podpadkem, NynÃ­podobnÃ½ model, but in a golden colour.
They wear different hairstyles: TentokrÃ¡tdrdol, before her hair.
75% of working mothers have problems associated with working motherhood.
Discrimination in employment in recent years has increased, especially in women younger, which they intend to buy a child.
This is the result of the study "fertility and the career of Spanish, which is carried out by the CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The study surveyed in women aged 15 to 75 years, and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market because of motherhood.
The study points out that at the beginning of the co-existence of many differences of opinion on the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start with a partner to live before, gave birth to their first child and generally have more children.
From the other side, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, the partner of coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years with a stable job with their first child at an average of 3.7 years from the beginning of living with a partner. The number of 4.1 in the for women, kterédosažení his stable job to pay the greater part of my life and have therefore had to postpone partner coexistence and the arrival of children.
The type of the profession is also a strong influence on motherhood, although a smaller influence on the opening of living with a partner, "said Margarita Delgado, who is devoted to research in the CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of the marriage of a child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher is the age when women marry and have their first child.
Differences are also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49 years, women with the Basic and Higher Education given birth of her first child at the age of 25. 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education to marry and gave birth to their first child before they find stable employment, while women with secondary or higher education in reverse, prefer to obtain a stable employment, before the marriage and the birth of the first child ", says Delgado.
Diane Kruger also is worth it.
L'Oreal Paris has just added a new name to its representative the prestigious list of: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actress will face of various products and brand under the universal slogan' cause I stand it.
A representative of' joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses international level, is thus added to the famous Osobnosteml'oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Even before it joined the club selected actress Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto (' Slumdog Millionaire').
Men's part of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by important artists: Patrick Dempsey ("Greyova Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangelinin partner in' Lost').
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the affairs of fashion.
The most important leaders - designers and models, past and present - gathered at the annual ceremony, which took place in London, the Court of Justice.
At the meeting, no one missing.

The path brings excitement and Vicent sparing no inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader's delight, even in repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
On Albert Camus: "The pages of this book, I found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but the spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but this cannot name: protiosudu, morality without guilt and innocence without any God."
Samuel Beckett: ", a Christian, he wrote from his own nature and not the intellect, something between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic, without a sense of humor, as if it were the blade of the knife, which almost killed him."
Graham Greene: "Our man was surrounded by their passion for this woman for the past thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and guilty, which is a spiritual privilege to attain the sky on the way."
The James Joyce: "This odyssey has in Paris in 1922, Sylvia Beach. It is one of the peaks in the universal literature, which is to be overcome from the north side, which is often the best climbers."
About William Faulkner: "It was a strange man.
In itself, he said himself, that he is the heir to the farmer in the county, sometimes, that is the son of black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was the same dreams. "
The Louis-Ferdinand CÃ©line: "The writer on the bridge a cry of a man from Munich to enter its echo in the night of 20th century in his literary form, he fled before him, and calling for the future and sharply to the worms."
The Dorothy Parker: "One knelt down and prayed:' Oh my beloved, make it, they stop writing like a woman."
The Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were inscribed spenserovy verse:" The effort comes a dream / storm after the calm port, / After the war to rest, / After a full life of death. "
The Virginia Wolf: "In their luggage was also her depression.
Husband totally agreed, that he told him that the Edward VII between azaleas or that the birds singing in Greek.
Never has a man been so patient and in love neurotic, whose literary talent goes hand in hand with the folly. "
O Pio Baroja: "What else was MartÃ­n Santos, than to focus on Joyce?
What else was benetovi than to execute faulknerovou weapons?
What else was celovi than do the famous at the expense of the glory of that man? "
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother went through our neighborhoods, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people the age of 15 to 18 years, and our dog rescued from the pound of weighing more than six pounds, without a word to him twice and severely wounded.
Our anger is all the more that we do not see anything funny in such an aggression against a small and helpless animal, which, moreover, was on a leash.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident when, on a walk with these individuals, she began to worry about his own safety, since such a devil, the man who think of the animal is able to do the same, and a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than he was.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in the usually quiet neighborhood.
Cried all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint to the nearest police station, but I doubt that it was, and to have a tricky question, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
Outrage led us to this fact.
We don't understand what is going on with today's youth, when they talk that a defenseless animal, which gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not understand, where you happened to good manners, respect for animals and people.

After nearly two years, the market begins to recover light-duty vehicles.
All vehicles registered in November in Spain meant an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and what's more, this is the first increase after 22 months of continuous decline, according to the figures of the organization of producers and retailers.
The positive data, however, is better to put in quarantine since November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and a 60% reduction compared with the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months are 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, ProdÃ¡no95. 853 vehicles, which includes all kinds of vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of cars, pick ups, vans, small trucks and light trucks / bogies.
And even, or which the most damaging demand, even when it is bought by private individuals, the majority of the purchases made small and medium-sized companies and almost 100% of cases, the financing through third parties.
The constraints resulting from the closure of bank loans, the source must be added as well as other factors such as the cessation of or continuation of bad economic situation.
In this situation, unlike the cars, support for the purchase of 2000 E helped too.
In addition to private individuals, it is to be noted Iosoby Business a of small and medium-sized firms, which they intend to buy a light utility vehicle to 3.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions, not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, once again, that there is the need to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The association expects that in 2010 will be the evolution of similar to last year, according to the calculations, the sale of passenger cars and 4 X4 drops by 19%.
Support System for the hand-brake is already mandatory equipment.

In fact, already form part of the compulsory fitting of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the other is a deadline for the removal of the lack of, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aims to enhance the protection of pedestrians, the works so that it can help to avoid the many collisions.
The hand brake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, this system detects when the driver presses.
But not always able to maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by an automotive parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers, who have an accident, Nesešlápli brake before the collision, and half of them did not use the full power of the brakes.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires maximum braking system, reducing the stopping distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, it could be avoided to 1 100 fatalities per year related to pedestrians.
This will be even more marked-the number of calculations in order to prevent one of the four incidents with the person-after the introduction of the so-called Intelligent Systems handbrake.
In this case, the vehicle equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) captures the obstacles and reports that the driver, except for the light braking.
If the driver responds, will help to increase the pressure on the pedal, if it is necessary.
If the driver does not react, even in the case in which a collision cannot be avoided, the device will be what on the brakes, and to reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.

His behavior can be described only as inviolable.
The weight does not mean that the vehicle to the asphalt.
Rather, on the contrary: we no longer push the so small and light model, which would, at the same time, a safety in movement in the corner, even at high speeds.
It's a little athlete, able to warm up the muscles for a short ride for the required period, time until he nenařídíme sprint, braking, and restore use of the engine.
Whatever we want. Thanks to the procedure, which is so communicative as accurate, whatever his hands on the steering wheel, it is what the car does.
And made with surgical precision.
The sound of the engine according to the will of
The sound of Boxer, of 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is a very important and it is possible to exaggerate the possibility of' Sport' and' a system which modifies the sound of the engine, which was previously used for Panamera.
The capacity of the acceleration is brutal, either at intake or recovery.
The hinges are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
Asphalt roads, which we pass with the Boxster Spyder, was quite good, but the car well teach potholes.
The support was during the journey almost useless, and while we are in some corners came at dawn on the gravel and, even in the late afternoon.
Finally this ultra-light car is one of the most enjoyable on the market, because it was something more than a mere modification Boxster S.

Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented the prevailing mood in the markets, again on the market uncertainty, which should not come as a surprise, because it is already a natural state in an environment where managers take decisions on the future, which is itself uncertain.
The drug is used by central banks to stabilize the market, it was the realization of the debt the direct purchase of assets and indirect release liquidity in rate close to zero, the financial institutions to buy assets to deduction.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets has virtually ended, and without undermining its disparate policy of liquidity, starting to throw some sand into the gears, as it has the Spanish central bank, with its auctions in the last year.
Investors, therefore cast doubt on the ability of the world economy to keep economic recovery without heterodox measures, and participate in the return of the reduction the of Risk.
The stock market volatility and the differences dluhopisůspolečností again regain points, although they are still very distant abnormal levels, which reached at the beginning of the year.
Member States were forced to socialize private risk, which once again, the public debt.
Once again, the pressure on the quality and the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven for investors, thereby expanding the differentiation of the euro area to Germany.
SPAIN This instability almost was hit, but at that time came, Standard &amp; Poor's threatened a new revision of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is useless to silence the advocates of moral hazard, who again tried to charge to the conscience of the persons responsible for the world's economic policy because of the devastating consequences of reducing the credit on employment, when in fact, it would need to declare a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between the emir to restore power in the Emirates, and as for Greece, that we have seen before.

Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and the Socrates of Portugal, Durão Barroso.
Does not make sense to the EcoFin saving Hungary from failure of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow member countries of the euro has not fulfilled its obligations.
But what makes sense, is that the Ecofin Council by the Greek Government to transparency and commitment of its own citizens to a shared responsibility for the necessary emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the normalization of the premiums from the transitional risk, after some of the excesses supported positions would be in line with expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in the public debt will increase, as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry about.
If Europe is reduced and our differences will be further extended, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard &amp; Poor's is a joke. when our leading indicators of the majority of studies to anticipate the renewal of its scenarios and revise its scenario increases for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenarios for the Spanish economy it foretells a great chance to meet the survival of the alert.
Again, it seems that it will be a great opportunity to buy the assets, although for now, "Be careful, the drivers".
