At the end of the exchanges, the stock market of Prague tipped in the negative one 
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the stock market of Prague réctifia its losses. 
The transactions with the actions atteignirent almost the half of the habitual daily exchanges. 
Tuesday, as early as the exchange beginning, the stock market of Prague renewed with his fall of the day before, when she lost almost six percent. 
This time, the decrease is had to the action fall to the Wall Street. 
The market reaction facing the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, that refused to adopt the plan of stabilization of the financial American sector, is thus perceptible equally at our place. 
Fall actions in Asia 
The Asian stock markets vécurent Tuesday a dramatic fall, even if the indices succeeded, during the day, to obliterate a part of the losses. 
The index Hang Seng of the stock market of Hong kong perdit four percent during the exchanges, but late, it obliterated a part of the losses and reduced the decrease to near of 2.5 percent. 
The index Hang Seng Dyed following Enterprises the movement of the Chinese actions of the stock market of Hong kong perdit 3.8 percent, the markets being closed to Shanghaï. 
The actions of the stock market of Sydney lost more than five percent, but finally one succeeds reducing the losses to 4.3 percent. 
According to his index, the stock Market of Taiwan perdit 3.6 percent. 
"The hesitation on the subject of the salvage action to the WORE will influence on the financial markets of the entire world," observed Joseph Yam, the boss of the monetary office of Hong kong. 
Although Hong kong be part of China, it establishes his monetary policy himself, c'est-à-dire regardless of the Chinese central bank. 
The interest rate have at Hong kong it same level that to the United States. 
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should quickly resume the negotiations and adopt the suggestion of support of the financial system. 
Otherwise, one would risk that of other countries undergo the incidences. 
The bath of blood of the American actions 
Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the project of support of the financial system, to which one she should have consecrated until 700 billion dollars (close to 12 fretted of. 
The legislators denied thus the call to the supports project of the president George Bush. 
According to Bush, the project should resolve the principal causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the entire economy. 
The American actions vécurent, Monday, a bath of blood and the principal indices of actions connurent more big fall of these 20 last years. 
The index Dow Jones perdit close to seven percent, having known a fall of such a breadth for the last time in 1987. 
The index already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the suggestion was not adopted, it was in free fall. 
The Congress yielded: the government of the WORE can inject 700 billion dollars in the banks 
The leaders of the American Congress and the government of the president George W. Bush came to an agreement on a wider form of the agreement of financial assistance to the American financial system. 
It will be subjected to the vote at the start of the week next. 
The American legislators carried out a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a plan of salvage under the form of a financial assistance of an amount of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillions of crowns), granted to the American financial system. 
The success is not for as much sure. 
In fact, before to be able to publish the final version of the law and to subject to it the vote, the Congressmans must finish a number of details of the agreement. 
The plan of support of the financial system will be examined Monday to the House of Representatives. 
Said Sunday to the agency Reuters Barney Frank, the president of the committee of the bank and financial regulation of the Room. 
According to sources, on Wednesdays as soon as possible, the plan would must has priori to be subjected to the vote to the Senate. 
According to the economists, the announcement on account of the fact that the salvage plan will be adopted should constitute a first psychological major factor to rekindle the financial markets. 
Now, being given the complexity of the mechanisms grace to which ones helps it the markets can be effective, will follow a "disillusion". 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We realized a big progress. 
We regulated our differing opinions concerning the form that should have the measure package for the market stabilization," confided in the Agency Bloomberg the democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
According to her, the final vote could be carried out as early as Sunday. 
In the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met the minister of the American finances Henry Paulson, in order to give at the far end of the government a final form. 
This one should repurchase, with the financial corporations, the real estate active invendables that induce the financial businesses in considerable losses and threaten system stability in his entirety. 
"We are about to to come to an agreement on a plan that will work and that must be, equally, effective on the market. 
It is necessary again to follow this plan of restoration of the markets, but I think that we there are," said Paulson. 
A signal for the Asian exchanges 
The world-wide financial crisis has considerable incidences on the action markets that fall. 
According to the senator democrat did not escape Harry Reid, the legislators do so that the Congress results in a final agreement as early as Sunday. 
They wish thus calm the investors before the exchange beginning on the financial Asian markets, that are situated in the first zone schedule, where the decision of the Congress could influence on the exchanges of Monday. 
Now, for the moment, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two Rooms of the American Congress will proceed to the vote, or if the negotiations do not risk remaining blocked, to the last moment, by such or such problem. 
The legislators hope that it will be adopted during the days to come. 
Nevertheless, the law will know again many modifications. 
Destined the Total Amount using the system must be divided in two parties. 
The first 350 billion dollars, as wished it the president George Bush, must be available as soon as possible. 
But, if the Congress will have the impression that the program does not fill his function, it has the possibility to block amount granting remaining, in following two steps: first 100 billion dollars additional, then, to finish, 350 billion dollars. 
Mr. Bush greeted the progress in the negotiations 
Although the president can put his veto to this decision, the Congress, him, has the possibility to put this one in minority. 
Despite these modifications, the principal idea of the program, that consist in to obtain from the finances for the buyback of the bad real estate titles, of which the value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not in measure to pay their hypothèques, was maintained. 
"The whole work is done. 
The House of Representatives should be in a position to proceed Sunday to the law vote, and the Senate Monday," indicated the republican senator Judd Gregg. 
The American president George Bush is himself happy with the progress in the negotiations. 
His spokesperson Tony Fratto declared that Mr. Bush was happy with the carried out progress Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort in order to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy". 
Limitation of the gilded parachutes 
The president of the bank committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, negotiator in boss, says that the legislators came to an agreement on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of the contributing against the losses, the agreement of tax relief, plan sequence on the time axis. 
The new law foresees equally to limit lesdits parachute gilded for the corporation directors participating in the program and she institutes a committee, that will assure the funds supervision. 
The latter should be managed by the finance ministry. 
"We worked very hard on the question and made progress important towards an agreement that will walk and will be effective for the market and for all the Americans", declared Paulson. 
The plan foresees equally an assistance for the real estate owners, that have problems to pay. 
The government should negotiate again down payments in the case of hypothèques that she will repurchase, all while diminishing the mensualités of the debtors and while allowing the latter to keep their houses. 
Marek: A psychological assistance 
According to the boss economist of Patria Finances David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but his realization will be very difficult. 
"And that is had to the Fact that one is unaware of which will be the mechanism and the price of the buyback of the active ones to problems. 
This point will be determining to split on the loss division between the financial sector and the government," said Marek, this week, to the server iHNed.cz. 
If the plan will be adopted now, or well at the start of the week next, is not, according to Marek, so important that that. 
"It is a lot more important than the congressmans come to an agreement, as early as this week, that they support this plan and that they will consecrate it as soon as possible. 
This psychological meaning of the agreement, provident the adoption of the plan, import the more in this moment," underlined Marek. 
A pushed fight to the extreme one: the readers MP3 against the movable ones. 
One you conseillera, how to choose 
While practically all the movable ones know to read files MP3, no reader MP3 knows to telephone. 
It seems to result some clearly that it is more better to buy only a telephone. 
Prevents only it exists sufficiently reasons to obtain itself an independent reader. 
The choice depends completely of the method of usage and requirements of the future owner. 
It would be absurd to buy for the house a dear gramophone of top of range to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On one hand, of such musical products do not go out on disc vinyle, and, from the standpoint quality, there is not any reason objectifies, for that that produces itself. 
Now, if there is in your shelves of the discs vinyles piled up, with rock art, jazz or blues, you dream at least probably such a gramophone. 
It is the same music during the movements, to know compressed music, to say it in a manner simplified - music in MP3. 
There also, there are categories according to the price and quality. 
For the one, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, same manner that a fan of the Pink Floyd would have trouble to bear receivers bought for twenty crowns to the market. 
Here two extreme ones, between which these there is enough places for everyone. 
The choice is wide. 
The length of life of the batteries is equally decisive 
Certain readers of high music of range are able a lot more things than of a simple reading of music, but it is a matter there of unknown functions, well evidently, of most of the movable ones. 
No current device is as universal as telephones it. 
Next to the first functions, the telephone calls and the sending of SMS, it is able to read music and the films, to record the latter, it possesses a camera of variable quality and can, for example, until to serve to navigation. 
And if one takes into account the Smartphones and the communicators, you will have in your pocket a small computer. 
Being given that no frigidaire knows to roast meat and that no television will take photographs, we attend practically to a miracle. 
Now, the universal character of the movable one is not without inconveniences. 
More the number of functions than you use is big, more the interval between two rechargements will see itself reduces. 
And the music reading is the one of the greedy pigs of energy more important. 
Are rare the movable ones that are able to read music during ten at twelve o'clock, in most of the cases, this figure is clearly inferior. 
In this respect, the music readers (specially the most rudimentary ones) are clearly more performance. 
In the case of the movable inexpensive one, count that they will not play the music that during some hours. 
If, what's more, it you arrive to call time in time, you obtain, to be on, a second one to refill for the work - this being valid even for the dearer devices. 
Itself problem will not put itself for the readers MP3, that are capable, following a rechargement, of a continuous functioning of at least 9 hours, including the less performance one. 
Another problem arises at the time of the music recording in the movable one. 
Unfortunately, that a limited party of the devices has access to a universal connector USB, so much more not all directly cannot be connected to the computer, without a special software. 
One can, evidently, record music directly on the card memory, but few readers of cards know to do it without reduction, being given the tiny dimensions of the cards memories used in the movable ones. 
In the matter of the readers, you need not, except exception (iPod), of any software. 
It suffices to fill, through the connector USB, the music device originating computer. 
Most of the movable and readers will create themselves a library media classified according to the name of the interpreter, the album title, style, or then according to the judgement of the user. 
Certain devices post only an index having a tree structure, to the manner To Explore it Windows, of others are able the two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, the intelligent telephones with system opératoire). 
The readers are easier to handle, the movable ones have more know-how 
In the choice of a concrete device, you are very interested in the length of life of the accumulator, to the memory capacity, to the quality and to the type of go out of his and, of course, to the order ease. 
If the music is for you, essentially, a noise of bottom and if in the day go you to listen some that during a limited time, for example while taking the tram, it suffices you movable any reading the MP3. 
Practically all the movable ones some are today capable. 
You did not even oblige of too to pay attention to the formats of music that the movable or the reader is able to read. 
All arrivals to read the MP3 and the big majority of the music that will reach until will have you exactly this format. 
It is part of the formats more shed and to leaves him, the big majority of the devices arrives to read equally music of format WMA. 
The AAC (format used by the firm Apple and its iPods), for his part, is less current. 
The movable tops of range allow equally, for example, the purchase of online music. 
It suffices to visit, since the portable telephone, the pages web of the operator (or the one of another supplier) corresponding and buy the song or the album in question. 
This service to him only should constitute a reason convincing to obtain itself a movable musical one. 
The offer of the operators is unfortunately miserable and she herself limit, in most of the cases, to radios tubes quickly do. 
The prices are not not more of the more bottoms. 
Nevertheless, one generally considers that this manner to buy the music (that this be by GSM, internet, indeed by the internet without wire) will dominate the musical industry in the future. 
Most of the people always carry their movable one on oneself. 
Every time that you want to listen something, you have only go out the movable one of your pocket, while you forgot your reader MP3 to the house. 
Now, it is equally important if you always have on you of the receivers or well a handsfree with connection. 
If this is not the case, you can use the pregnant ones integrated, that possess practically all the movable, but a minimum of readers MP3. 
For a lot, the principal advantage of the musical movable ones is their price. 
The less dear one cost normally less than three thousand. 
For a price of three four thousand crowns, one can have an already walkman very suitable. 
Now, in most of the cases, you will have limited by the absence of exit for ordinary receivers. 
The price of the better telephones and better equipped one, provided equally of an entry for ordinary receivers, does not surpass fifteen thousand. 
The readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of to have an easy order. 
Really does not import that arrives to assure the order of the readers more rudimentary - that correspond necessarily to the less dear one (cf. our choice). 
A function minimum; and the order resemblance with the one of a post cassette, often used in the past, or of a gramophone, is evident. 
There is not risk of collision under the form of a movable connected internet by chance, followed by a bill of transmission of immense data. 
Which device to choose 
Even the movable the less dear one (by former. The Vodafone 527) possess generally a slot for cards memories échangeables (the type M2, microSD, and so on). 
Even while taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not surpass two thousand crowns. 
But watch out. 
The basic models do not support as a rule that of the cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the dearest ones themselves go out some even with cards memory of 8 GB. 
If you to already possess a movable one and want again buy a reader MP3 inexpensive, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or well an iriver. 
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1 100 crowns. 
If you be part of the more exacting listeners, choose rather movable specialized walkman (Sony Ericsson, certain Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices are provided with keys of independent order for MP3, and this is as well as the order ease comes close to itself the one of a reader MP3 independent. 
Sony Ericsson, of which the movable ones of the series walkman have the same menu user that of the readers MP3 sold separately, the one that went the most far in this domain. 
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (until 16 GB) and a length of life of the accumulator (normally 15 hours, until 35 o'clock) superior, is assured by a reader MP3 produces by the one of the mentioned brands higher. 
A first potential operator will win Czech this same year. 
Maybe 
The movable market in Czech comparatively is advanced, our operators proposing practically them same services that their partners in west Europe. 
Despite that, it lacks us anyway something - a potential operator, that would force the classical operators to lower the prices. 
It can himself that it will not lack during a long time. 
We already evoked, to many returns, on Mobil.cz the Fact that the Czech operators are part of the dearest ones in Europe. 
The (THE Czech Office of the Telecommunications), that signaled that the price of a SMS more student at our place than in the remainder of the Union, has it besides confirmed. 
This is as well as, after the last steps of the European Commission in the domain of the regulation of the redevances of roaming, a paradoxical position risks producing itself - the sharp SMS since the foreigner will be for certain customers of the Czech movable operators less dear than to the country. 
How is this possible one that the prices in Czech maintain themselves so high, in comparison with Europe? 
The response is simple, it lacks a competition that would wish really to enter into the fight. 
That can appear paradoxical, being given that we possess nonetheless three movable networks and a penetration that widely surpasses the 100%. 
On the contrary, the movable operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competed with. 
In this, Pavel the president of the Counsel of the Czech Office of the telecommunications that declared to several returns that in Czech there was no longer any place for another operator, done chorus with the operators. 
It is probably true that a classical operator with his own network has not apparently more a lot of luck (besides, at present, it would find only with difficulty frequencies). 
Now, it exists again a possibility - a potential operator. 
This exactly entered it potential operators on the movable market that induced a considerable decrease of the prices, to which had, afterward, react equally the classical operators. 
Nevertheless, before even the entry of the disturbance celebrate such as Movable Tesco or Movable Virgin on the market, similar voices to the one that one hears today at our place gave to understand themselves in Great Britain. 
Now, it appeared that there remained of the place for such operators and that they could have a real success. 
We are not besides obliged to be going to look for too far to find examples. 
In the month of February we had informed yourself launch, in Poland, potential operator Mobilking. 
In six months only, this operator succeeded winning more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator of the country. 
Add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, that possesses among others the U:fon in Tchèquie. 
The advantage of the potential operators being the possibility to concentrate on a group target a lot more concrete one. 
For that their functioning be effective, they have in fact need by far less than customers that a classical operator. 
They are, in fact, exempt of the expenses of construction, of exploitation and of maintain of the movable network, comparatively students. 
This is as well as in the world, the potential operators stand out as operators down with fresh - they propose calls and inexpensive SMS, which often is counterbalanced by an offer of limited services. 
For example Movable Tesco proposes, in Great Britain, SMS at least two times less dear than its competitors. 
Now, as the watch the example of Mobilking in Poland, bet on a group target unusual can equally constitute a good publicity stunt. 
In fact, this operator aims in a specific way the men. 
"The true men choose Mobilking - an operator that pleases for them and to which one they can do confidence," said David Seibert, the CEO of Movable Entertainment Company, exploiting this potential operator. 
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to walk equally at our place. 
Miroslav the Spokesperson of Vodafone, in doubt: "The Czech market is comparatively small for an approach segmentaire, on which is based most of the potential operators. 
So much more than it comparatively is saturated from the standpoint offer of the services." 
In Czech, no luck, say the movable operators 
It seems nevertheless almost sure that if there will be a potential operator in Czech, this will not be Mobilking. 
"We discuss the expansion of this project to success, but in Czech the negotiations are not very promoters. 
The launch of Mobilking will have rather place in of other countries of our zone," says in one maintains telephone for Mobil.cz Jana spokesperson of the financial group Penta. 
She thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in Czech were not, in any case, in favor of this idea. 
On the contrary, they try to do all their possible one for that a potential competitor cannot appear. 
The group GTS Novera, that would want thus to cross a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the domain of the customers business, does not hide, since enough a long time, his intention to launch a potential movable operator. 
"We hold a lot to be in a position to propose to our customers not only of the services of telecommunications set up, but equally movable. 
And the earlier will be the better. 
We already took negotiations on the subject of this possibility to several returns with the body of the Czech movable operators. 
With certain, we succeeded advancing in the negotiations," said the Spokesperson of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
The future is therefore maybe promising. 
Of after non official the news, it seems that we maybe could welcome the first potential operator already of here the end of the year. 
But for the moment, his creation is accompanied of a total silence. 
"In this moment, we do not estimate that there be place on the Czech market for a potential operator as such. 
The Czech market is in comparison with of very specific others. 
For the moment, no provided subject of a complex and serious project in this domain did not contact us," mentioned Vlastimil of the department of press of Telefonika O2, in his declaration for Mobil.cz. 
Of other operators themselves retrieve some equally to the specificity of the Czech market. 
The spokesperson of T MOVABLE Martina Kemrová asserts in a rare understanding with the declaration of O2: "We did not record for the moment project viable and bilaterally advantageous, that could use basis." 
And she adds: "It practically is excluded that a potential operator appears in the network T MOVABLE of here the end of the year. 
To operate in a period of time so limited, we should dispose starting now of a concrete agreement." 
Vodafone directs rather his attention on the request accomplishment to obtain his own license 3G. 
Miroslav says in comparison with that: "We opened to negotiations with potential potential operators, and especially in the domain of the expenses and divided infrastructures. 
This is what, according to us, means the more of provisions from the standpoint customers. 
The principal strategy of Vodafone in this domain being discovered it of a partner to set up a common network for a quick movable internet." 
Responsible authorities: in phase with the operators 
The gait of the movable operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean a competition increase, would have taken to a decrease of the prices and therefore to a decrease of their profit. 
To what good therefore to facilitate the advent of such a competitor? 
When it is a matter of their interests, the operators know to agree as larrons some fails. Argues it accompanying the creation of the U:fon some testifies equally. 
The biggest apparent pressure on the at the time of the creation of the U:fon, the one exercised by the corporation T MOVABLE. 
Some indicate accessible the news to the pulled publics of the pages web of the. 
Now, today, the U:fon itself ready to serve as argument in order not to accept a potential operator. 
Martina Kemrová noticed to this subject: "The competition on the movable market was, of more, recently amplified by the entry on the market of a fourth movable operator. 
Seen the character of the movable market in RT, it is evident that the entry of an additional player would submit it, and especially its services, to high requirements." 
But being given the attitude of the movable operators that here, the indifference of the organisms of Czech regulations appears disconcerting. 
It is not a matter nevertheless not only of the attitude of the that, in contrast to the Great Britain and to other developed nations, has not unfortunately, in Czech, the strength to intervene in the economical competition. 
This one belongs exclusively to the Office for the protection of the economical competition (ÚOHS). 
Now, the latter adopted, facing this problematic one, his typical position. 
"The entry of a potential operator on the movable market would be possible after the conclusion of an agreement between a movable operator and the potential operator in question concerning the housing of necessary infrastructure. 
No agreement of this type was not concluded for the moment, for the offer of the interested potential has not has priori presented sufficiently interest for the classical operators," specified in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of the department of the external relations of the ÚOHS. 
A formulated declaration thus not would surprise from representatives of the operators. 
But from an office, that must represent the interests of the consumers and among others also to take care, to what no one takes advantage of his position on the market, such a declaration is more than disconcerting. 
So much more than Kristián Chalupa adds: "Has the foreigner, where the potential operators are normally present, one can note that their entry on the market contributed to a decrease of the prices of the movable telephone services." 
Now, done pressure in the direction of an honest functioning of the market and of a decrease of the prices does not do apparently left the interests of the ÚOHS. 
What is effectively shocking is the concord almost touching of the three movable operators, that results from their reactions. 
The question, if it is a matter there really of a chance, puts itself all naturally. 
Same manner, a gasoline price strictly the same as all the stations of service is due surement at random and to the hard fight of the competition. 
"The office did not raise, to this subject, of signs of an anticompetitive behavior, it has not therefore any reason to intervene of a manner or of another. 
None of the operators has position dominating, anything has consequently a corresponding responsibility increased of his behavior on the market. 
The necessary tools to the opening of the movable market to the potential operators lack probably even to the regulating one telecommunications," specified in his declaration Chaloupa. 
The position interpretation dominating on the market constitutes the one of the numerous points of discord. 
Well heard, it exists an analysis of the pertinent markets elaborated by the according to which the telecommunications constitute, from the standpoint economical competition, a single market. 
None of the Czech operators has position dominating on a such walked. 
Nevertheless, certain experts of the right propose another vision of the things: for that the creation of a potential operator be possible, it is necessary to obtain, every time, the consent of the exploiting network. 
And the movable operator has enough logically the monopoly on his network. 
This is as well as it plays necessarily a role dominating in a certain segment of his activity. 
Now, even without admitting this line of argument, it should be at least disturbing for the ÚOHS that three movable operators proceed visibly in a similar way. 
Nevertheless, the complaints many interested (including the corporation GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they confront, in the negotiations with all the operators, analogous constraints. 
Let the responsibility fall again on the is a turn enough running in the communications, to the means of which the ÚOHS washes its matter hands. 
We already met this attitude type in several similar cases. 
One did not unfortunately succeed doing to pass in the law novélisation on the telecommunications, adopted recently, an expansion of the strengths of the on the domain of the economical competition in the telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement of the position. 
That, the representatives of the ÚOHS very well must know it, but their interests are situated apparently somewhere else. 
When no one looks at, that can walk 
That says, the functioning of a sort of operators pseudo potential, several in the Czech movable networks, unnoticed remainder. 
It is a business matter publishing their clean price list of the telephone movable services, but the latter are not public that in left. 
In most of the cases, it is a question of firms taking care of the multi-level marketing. 
Movable telephone services particularisés are thus proposed for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many other. 
The price lists of these firms do not reach generally that to elected officials. 
The magic turn consists in the Fact that the business does in front of the operator figures of a customer business classical, that orders a big quantity of cards SIM. 
As important customer, she obtains from the price offers (and of others) special. 
What puts problem is that the commercial conditions of all the Czech movable operators forbid a such sold. 
"If it produced himself what you evoke, it could be a matter of a transgression of the contractual conditions that we would examine and that could result in a collaboration stop with the corporation in question," replied to our question relating to this problem Martina Kemrová. 
Nevertheless, it is enough not very probable that an echo of such a activity did not reach until the persons in charge of the movable operators. 
Notably in the case of the three mentioned businesses it can be a matter of thousands of customers. 
Auncun operator, nevertheless, does not pronounce itself against such a procedure. 
In fact, the activities of these firms their bring of the non negligible profits, and, at the same time, as opposed to the true potential operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing. 
Miroslav indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, nevertheless, the services of these businesses are used only by a percentage of negligible customers. 
What's more, these are constrained to admit that the card SIM in their telephones is not recorded under their name, they do not be able therefore some to dispose fully, to the manner of the ordinary customers of the movable operators." 
Now, this is that precisely that should appear strange to the. 
Of more, puts itself another question to the ÚOHS. 
If the movable operators close the eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a potential operator? 
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has access to comparatively wide strengths to be able to unveil such a activity, and if it will not wish to satisfy itself explanations of the operators, that assert to have no idea that that would produce itself, their contractual conditions forbidding it. 
When we no longer will be the country more dear 
As already evoked us to several returns, the entry of potential operators on the movable market brought a considerable decrease of the price of the services. 
Now, practically in all the countries where appeared of the potential operators, the classical operators strove, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation. 
The arguments used by the latter were practically them even - a too small market, indeed too saturated, problems with the service quality, etc. 
Now, this is precisely to this level that intervened, in the developed nations, the regulating organisms, that defended not the interests of the movable operators, but those of their customers. 
Just as well by definite measures as by an informal pressure, they ended up to obtain the creation of a first potential operator, followed by of others. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulating organisms treat this question to the manner of a hot potato of which one rids while transmitting it to a close target. 
After the experiences that we have, we cannot rid impression that the confusion in competences is for them in these cases more profitable. 
But not tokens the sleeve after the ax. 
If the news of slide say true and a potential operator will appear soon at our place, the Czech movable market will put back itself maybe in movement. 
If the one of the operators accepted the creation of a potential movable operator, the ÚOHS will be able only with difficulty to remain impassive facing the rejection (to discrimination) of others interested. 
And we will stop maybe to call dearer than in the remainder of Europe. 
The new Czech hymn has four new versions. 
Choose the better one 
Ecoutez the four realizations of the new version of the Czech national hymn. 
Sunday, to the occasion of the Day of the Czech nationality, the Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national hymn Kde domov (Where is my fatherland?). 
The hymn has again been recorded by the orchestra of the national Theater under the direction of. 
We have access to four versions - with a song solo masculine or feminine, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version. 
The song is assured by and Adam Plachetka. 
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav are the authors of the arrangements of the hymn. 
You can listen the four new versions on the server iHNed.cz. 
Consider the Czech national song as the one of the most beautiful hymns. 
As it already had entrusted beforehand to the rozhlas (the Czech public radio), it chose for the interpretation of the versions solo of the singers with young and representative voices, that are marked and appreciated. 
"Since the beginning, I tried to take care to what the two singers, as well as the choir, have a good diction, so that one understands well the words, that they sing in a manner simultaneous," it specified. 
The Czech national hymn will celebrate, the next year, his 175È anniversary. 
The song Kde domov resounds for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the state Theater) in (Bazaar of the savetiers), original Czech piece of Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied music of František Škroup. 
It became popular and the people themselves have it fitting spontanément. 
After the creation of the Tchécoslaovaquie in 1918, the first verse became naturally integral part of the national hymn. 
It remained the one of the seven same national symbols after the creation of the independent Czech Republic. 
How rings the "new" hymn 
The public transit (MHD) pragois will introduce, Wednesday, the flea in their system of cash machine 
On Wednesdays 1st October 2008 will have been in line with the history of the Dopravní podnik (the Agency pragoise of the transportations) as the date to which climb in the subway, the trams and the buses the first passengers, that, instead of having a ticket in paper, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon. 
In this moment, the latter is accessible for almost hundred thousand persons, card owners to flea Opencard. 
The passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this one will be valid from the 1st January 2009) and at once to do it to record on their card to flea in the points of information and the offices of the Dopravní podnik (the transportation Agency), situated in the stations of subway Muzeum, Holešovice, Roztyly, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, and Luka. 
From yesterday, there is equally the possibility to buy the coupon by internet on the pages web of the Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz. 
More than four hundred persons took service advantage during the morning. 
Those that will begin using the online store can forget in a final way the windows in the subway stations, where they had so far to trample impatience in of long tails with the intention of to obtain from the tickets in paper. 
In fact, they will buy their coupon by internet and one will record it on their card Opencard in the one of the thirteen knihovna (municipal libraries). 
"In these points contact, there is at the disposal of the passengers a window with a formed personnel, that will help the interested with the purchase by internet and, of more, will record the coupon that they bought on their card," said the Spokesperson of the project Martin Opatrný. 
Next to the libraries, it will be equally possible to record the electronic coupon on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the hall of several stations of subway. 
Do to what resemble these distributors? 
They are red, recall the machines to punch the tickets and the passengers the maybe already noticed in the stations of subway Roztyly, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"Today, the city has five, but of here the end of the year, it would have there some to have eighty," added Opatrný. 
A robot will check the coupon instead of the driver 
The robots that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use. 
It suffices to introduce the card to flea Opencard and the coupon bought previously will record itself himself on the card. 
The electronic coupon are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but equally in the vicinity city. 
To know in the trains périurbains and the bus lines 300 to 499, that use essentially living them towns of central Bohemia to attain the capital. 
"In the trains integrated to integrovaná doprava (transportations integrated Prague), the inspectors are equipped readers of cards, to the assistance of which ones they establish the temporary validité and coupon zonale;" explained the check of the bills Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, that conceives the schedules of the public transit pragois. 
The buses périurbains are equipped readers of cards integrated to the cash register of the driver. 
At the time of boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the card to flea to the driver, but it is necessary equally to place the Opencard to the advisable place on the side of the cash register. 
This is as well as the driver checks the validité of the recorded coupon. 
"In case the passenger would need to verify the validité of the recorded coupon, it has not anything of simpler one than to ask these information to the driver," completed Drápal. 
The passengers that do not take the buses périurbains and will not remember date where expires the validité of their coupon, can rejoin again the automatic distributors, initially used to record the coupon on the card. 
This is there, on the device screen, that will post themselves the news concerning the validité of their document. 
The Sudètes claimed a referendum to the WORE 
The Germans of the Sudètes asked in 1945 to what Šumava is integrated to the United States. 
That results from a deposited letter in the collections of the knihovna (The scientific Library of the Bohemia of the south). 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the employers of the United States of America. 
In 1945, certain groups of Germans of the Sudètes addressed themselves prétendument to the president of the WORE with such a desire. 
That results among others of a preserved letter in a private archive, that today is deposited in the collections of the knihovna. 
Germans of Krumlov pray in the letter the American president of not to allow that "šumavská (forest region to the south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler by virtue of the agreement of Munich - is returned to Czechoslovakia. 
"We well understood the position and want be really sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops come on the German territory not in oppressors and enemies, but in liberating," is written in the letter, signed "Persons, to which ones goes out of it the Šumava is anxious heart". 
Being given that the rallying to Czechoslovakia is not promising prétendument - while knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, of attitude without consideration, of lack of understanding, of oppression and of bondage, the letter authors pray the American president to take in its hands the protectorat of the Šumava for now and for always. 
"We cannot believe, that you would grant this territory to a foreign State to us, that oppresss and destroys the minorities and that not has at all contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking in consideration the opinion of the quarter of millions of the inhabitants," is written in the letter. 
The supposed reason for which the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire of vengeance of the "Czech oppressors". 
If the president of the WORE doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, it would have only to organize, according to the letter authors, a referendum in the region to establish if its inhabitants wanted to be part of the WORE, or well to live under the employers of the United States. 
Although the contained text in the letter can, considering the current knowledge of the history of the after war, appear somewhat naïve, according to certain survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Germans of the Sudètes of the era. 
While the Czech Germans had all at least to glimpse that the question of their expulsion of the republic will put itself, very little of them acknowledged themselves such a possibility. 
Some awaited that the United States and the Great Britain were going to obtain for the Sudètes a certain type of autonomy. 
Of others believed that they would remain all simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, been born to the confirms. 
During the war, this one was, as German of engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries. 
When at the end of the war, it was captured by the English and placed in the camp of capture of the region Holstein, tens of Czech Germans came to consult it for that it learns them the Czech one. 
"They believed that once of return at their place, the Czech one would be for them profitable", said Chalupa. 
None of the captured Germans that lived in Czechoslovakia before the war estimated, according to him, that, after the Decrees Beneš, it would be expelled from the republic. 
You do not reflect - you pay! 
An emotional country will attack the drivers 
The action aiming the road security the most costly one in the Czech history. 
A manner to characterize the emotional media country that to the intention to launch, Wednesday, the transportation ministry. 
The office of the minister Aleš considers that she will discourage the drivers of a dangerous behavior to the flying one. 
This country costing 150 million will appear to the television, to the radio, to the movies, on internet, but also on leaflets. 
She should discourage the drivers of quick driving and alcohol to the flying one. 
But equally to remind of for them to take the belt before starting up. 
She wants especially to touch the conscience of the young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, without forgetting the professional drivers. 
Will which appear in the spots? 
Especially personal histories that will attack the emotions. 
Some testifies equally the slogan "bloody" of the whole country: 
You do not reflect - you pay! 
The sentence "You do not reflect" is registered in capital letters on the registration plate. 
Then, in a blood pool, there is the sentence "You will pay". 
Which must symbolize that one can pay life an instant of inattention. 
The spots go "to haunt" the spectators up to 2010. 
The ministry inspired itself analogous countries in the countries Anglo-saxons, where one can see commonly pictures with drastic pictures of the victims of the accidents. 
It considers that that will induce a decrease of the rate of accidents and number of deaths on the Czech roads. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
The strategy of Sugar and whip against the drivers 
"What walks with the drivers is the system of Sugar and whip. 
For them, Sugar is represented, for example, by the fact to save time, when they roast a red fire. 
The whip, this is the threat of a fine or of an accident. 
The risks must be recalled to the drivers," said Martin the psychologist of the transportations of the hospital Na Homolce. 
This is as well as it is necessary for us countries of information in the press and especially negative advertisings, estimates the psychologist. 
The panels signaling the danger to the drivers are, according to him, already less effective. 
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it probably will quickly merge with the environment and the drivers will not notice it more," signaled. 
Olmert would return in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories 
Ehud Olmert, the president of the provisional government Israeli, pronounced itself in favor of the restitution of practically all the occupied territories in 1967, including therefore the West Bank, Jerusalem Is and the heights of the Golan, in exchange for the peace with the Palestine and the Syria. 
It did this declaration in a published interview Monday by the Newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"We must result in an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the territories (occupied), indeed all," said Olmert to the Newspaper. 
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to yield to the Palestinians an analogous percentage (Israeli territory), since without that, peace will not be done," it added. 
It admit that the possible restitution would understand Jerusalem Is. 
"The one that desires the security to Jerusalem, and especially does not desire that of the tractors and bulldozers crush him the feet, as that arrived to the one of my better friends, will have to renounce on the part of Jerusalem," noticed Olmert while referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, during of which ones several persons were killed and tens of injured persons. 
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, the sacred and historic places" situated inside the Old city. 
"The one that will want to maintain the Israeli sovereignty on the whole city will be constrained to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
That will not walk," it underlined afterward. 
Retirement of the heights of the Golan 
Olmert pronounced itself equally in favor of the retirement of Israel of the heights of the Golan, which constitutes, according to him, an essential condition regarding the conclusion of an agreement of peace with the Syria. 
Now, that would necessitate equally certain efforts from Damask. 
"I do not propose to conclude the peace with the Syria only on the basis of a retirement of the Golan," it signaled. 
"The Syrian ones know very well to what they will have to renounce to obtain the Golan. 
They will have to renounce their current relations with the Iran; they will have to renounce their relation with the Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to renounce the supports constant that they grant to the terrorism of the Hamas (Shiite movement), al-kaïda (terrorist network), just like of the one of the Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," precise the Prime Minister. 
Questions that arise after the accident: The flight attendants in the bus are they illegal? 
The law is unaware of them; walk in a long bus distance is forbidden 
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of the corporation Student Agency close to Padoue, in Italy, arises the question if the flight attendants and the passengers are able during the trip to move itself inside the bus. 
"If one wanted to respect the in a manner strict and definite law, the activity of an in contrast to flight attendant the law on the road circulation," said the Spokesperson of the ministry of the transportations Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in question, during which perish a 22 years old hostess, apparently was caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus way. 
The girl at this point in time unfortunately was sat next to the driver, on the seat more dangerous of the vehicle, although she have at his disposal two others sit. 
Now, the bus can have an accident, indeed to brake in a manner rushes, equally the moment the flight attendant serves coffee or distributes the newspapers. 
What imports is if the bus is by virtue of his technical card equipped of standing places or no. 
If this equipment for standing places is not confirmed, the passengers must remain sit. 
The long buses distance Student Agency do not dispose any standing places; which was confirmed to by the director of the business Radim. 
"This is a question that we treated with the ministry and, at first, it forbids all movement of the passengers. 
Then they canceled it and we obtained that the passengers can go to the toilets during the trip provided that they have their clean seat," it unveiled his position. 
The law is unaware of the flight attendant 
"It does not exist any lawful interpretation univoque of the role of flight attendant - no lawful prescription does not take care of this role. 
On the other hand, no lawful prescription does not forbid not more to the carrier to propose services. 
The law on the road transportations knows only the term of receiver of vehicle; she does not define its rights and its duties," adds with more of ambigüité the spokesperson Hanzelka. 
Josef Pokorný, the director of the department of the circulation of the road vehicles, estimate, on the contrary, that the law treats sufficiently the problematic one. 
"All depends on the fact if the bus has in his probate the permission to propose standing places. 
All resident inside," he says. 
The buses are divided in urban, where there are standing places and a maximum limited speed, long distance with standing places and an authorized speed more student and in long buses distance without standing place with maximum authorized speed the more student and equipped seats of seat belts. 
As in the airplane, says an expert 
Jaroslav expert to BESIP (security of the road circulation) in security in the transportations, does not see the movement of the flight attendants on board as a major problem. 
"At the time of an uniform circulation, there is not danger. The position can be compared to the one of the service in the airplanes. 
There not more, it is not sure when will produce itself a turbulence and the air hostess can bang its head." 
"Now, if the bus would have braked manner rushes, the physics laws would be evidently valid. 
Same manner that in an urban bus or in a tram. 
The carrier must manage the security of the flight attendants by internal prescriptions," he says and estimates equally that from the standpoint law, the problematic one is not regulated. 
is ready to eliminate these services 
Student Agency is the only carrier bus to propose the services of flight attendants. 
It in hires two hundred. 
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their trade as a trade to risk. 
"Nevertheless, as soon as I will have the impression that it is a matter of a trade to risks, I will eliminate it. 
The passengers can receive their coffee and their newspaper to boarding. 
That would diminish equally the expenses," he says. 
The security concern is the reason that gives to the absence of flight attendants in its vehicles the director of the Asiana Alexeï Litvine, that assures, in comparison with HIS, a number very reduces lines. 
"We have not any hostesses. We ourselves there let us oppose since the beginning. 
Sooner or later that will finish by a mortal accident," it said, a year ago, to Týden.cz. 
An immense tragedy arrived 
A young hostess of the region of that worked for the corporation for two years, perish at the time of the accident on the line of Naples. 
A truck slovène probably has quité the band of stop of urgency without using turn signal and it blocked the way to the bus. 
The driver of the latter to try to avoid it by means of a maneuver rushes, but it brushed it by his straight side. 
Refuse that the two reserved seats to the rest of the flight attendants were sold. 
"In the case of the long lines distance, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked." 
The business counts to carry complaint against the truck driver. 
For the compensation of the family of the girl, the agency will not await the judgement of the court, but in the matter of the financial compensation, she counts also on the guilty one. 
A law modification? 
Not visible 
A modification of the law, that is being elaborated, since more of a year, by a group of thirty experts of the ministry of the transportations, could bring precisions as for the movements of the flight attendants on board of the bus. 
"Now, she did not result in an any conclusion on this point. 
To true to say, she does not be interested too to the buses, but rather to the point system, to maximum speed on the expressway and to the usage of the portable one to the flying one," says the expert. 
"The transportation ministry does not consider the activity of the flight attendants as a thing that basically would put in peril the security of the passengers," concludes the spokesperson Hanzelka, while specifying that the check of the security of the buses is under the strength of the police and office for the security to the work. 
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois rest on Frankfurt. 
The big words did not lack in the letter addressed by the guiding committee of the WestLB to the house employees. 
Of by a union of the entities of the financial institute of Düsseldorf with the deka-bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could constitute itself, according to the mail made public Monday. 
The WestLB would bring a "competence pad" doubled of a durable productivity in such a matter. 
When all is said and done, such a relation could be the blow of decisive sending towards of other concentrations in the sector of the banks of the Länder. 
Veiled to what that resembles when a committee board of directors is anxious to show his action capacity in difficult times. 
For the WestLB, injured, always undergoes a strong pressure. 
This is not only the European Commission, but also federal Authority of Supervision of the Financial Services that has, that only recently, clearly does to understand to the government of the Land of Rhenanie of the North westfalie that the time was counted in the research of a future solution. 
It is nevertheless question since some times already - also side of Frankfurt - of a relation of a form any between the bank Deka, that connait the customers of the Sparkasse of by their investment funds, and the WestLB. 
Of course the boss of the deta-bank Franz Waas made known at the time of the presentation of the figures of the fine semester August that it do not see any direction in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, that this be the Helaba or the WestLB. 
Nevertheless the board of directors of the Deka, of which every half is borne and by the banks of the Länder and by the groupings of savings banks, loaded the guiding committee to drive talks with the WestLB regarding commercial activities towns. 
It then could be a question of the debit of the financial market, or of parties of this one. 
The talks nevertheless only have just begun, says one in the financial place. 
This is not the first time that the deta-bank, that, with its 3000 employees, counts for the one of the most important employers on the financial place of Frankfurt, enters in game lorqu'il is question of consolidation of the sector of the savings banks. 
In 2003 one believed during a moment that the deta-bank could merge with the bank of the Land of Rhénanie Palatinat and the Halbab. 
Nothing did not nevertheless go out again of this ternary bouquet. 
Scarcely the plans had they summer made public that the government of the Land of Hesse pronounced itself against all participation of the Hellaba in these. 
Afterward, the two other not houses not itself rejoignèrent. 
The bank of the Land of Rhénanie Palatinat was related to the place to the bank of the Land of bade-wuttenberg to Stuttgart. 
But there always were new negotations on deka-bank grouping with banks of Länder. 
Finally, Günther Merl, president of the guiding committee of the Hellaba, nevertheless had pronounced itself against all commercial strategy of merger with his bank. 
Regardless of that, the feeling seems to shed itself that the grouping of the different establishments of the public sector is particularly urgent. 
Now that the election to the Parliament of the Land of Bavière is passed, a union of the BayernLB with the bank of the Land of bade-wuttenberg could make real itself in all first one. 
For the Helaba, this is not particularly a new good one. 
If the pressure that obliges to new mergers had to increase, the eventual partners escape for him little by little. 
In the South, she would be henceforth a junior partner, although she have even there more better withstood to the crisis than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart. 
The grouping of the savings banks and hesse-thuringe transfers, that possesses 85 percent of the capital of the Helaba, has on the other hand pulled a lock at first of the year on all union with the WestLB. 
Would remain at the harshness the NordLB. 
Of such reflections géo-stratégiques does not reflect nevertheless that one of the facets. 
Another facet asks the question of knowledge of which manner the different commercial models of each of these banks can match themselves. 
In June, Merl declared that the decisive question, to know thanks to which commercial model the future capacity of the banks of the Länder should be assured, had not been even there resolved by the German grouping of the savings banks and transfers. 
In the end, a cutting up of the WestLb could take place, cutting up that here evidently is not wished. 
This is also of that of which it is question in the letter of the committee board of directors in place: in any case, would be aimed a global `solution' for the establishment. 
In what way all that will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the deta-bank still remains to see. 
The second weekend of the party of beer also is known as during the weekend Italians. 
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena accompanies it as girlfriend, and therefore nothing is similar, he says. 
Behind them, close to a barrel of five liters of beer of the brand Kaiser, is held a bearded built good that shows to about 200 visitors of the party of which beers deep sounds his throats can produce. 
Elena types first Luca, then the kisses. 
Of Bologne, they came to Vérone. 
From there, road train station close to the train station Puorta nueva, four buses take tonight the departure to 23h45, `destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrived foreseen to 6h30. 
Three buses are reserved before all for the Italians, in one of the bus travel brésilens exclusively. 
In a corner of the parking lot, the South American sing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated the last night. 
And so noisy, explain Marco Guarda, this is not for the Italians. 
The buses belong to Marco, that carries a long doubled coat of false fur and glasses to the wide silver-plated mountings. 
For five years, they go to the beer party, already three turned ones nothing that this year. 
They there go night, remain the day to the party, and return to 22h30. 
There to pass the night would imply useless expenses, explains Marco. 
The trip costs 75 Euros, including the welcoming jar with a beer Kaiser, tossed in accordance with the law of Bavarian purity, the disease insurance and a person in charge of the group speaking German - Marco did a language course to Frankfurt. 
And already the buses roll in the night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'. 
There is not beer, not again. 
Quickly, all becomes calm in the bus, the travelers sleep. 
This is better thus, they will have again need of their forces. 
Pauses will be done to Bressanone, and to Holzkirchen, while a big number of other buses with plates of Italian registrations do once more a pause little before Munich, on the expressway 8. 
When to the small morning, the group of Marco arrives finally at six o'clock thirty as foreseen on the parking lot close to the place Thérèse, close to 50 other buses of all Europe already are there. 
Elena, Luca and the others muster themselves, Marco holds a last speech, explains the attack plan. 
First: to groom small yellow cap. 
Over is written to the left `Fête of beer', in gothic, and side issue addresses it internet of the agency of trip of Marco `conoscersiviaggiando.it". 
Deuxièmement: `Lorsque the doors of the capital of beer open, one runs', screams Marco in the small morning. 
`Courir!' Run and reserve the places at the far end of the stretched. 
`Pas in front of, otherwise one blocks, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, it is necessary to divide up them in the room!' 
Nabs it, screams Marco, costs 8,25 Euros. 
And do not forget records it! 
`Montrer to the security agents that we behave well! 
As soon as you leave your places, they left!' 
Troisièmement: `Ce evening, to have returned here has ten hours and half battery!' Do understand? 
And that there is, this left towards the beer party. 
On the way, someone ties up yellow caps to the trees to rediscover the way, to the panels and even to an electoral poster of a big Bavarian popular party. 
One is anxious to be ready for the return. 
This is the second weekend of the party of beer, known as the `week-end of the Italians'. 
It does not exist any precise figures; one talks about 50000 that put themselves in road through the Alps and collapse in the kiosk to beer, 10 percent of the visitors would have come deliberately of Italy this weekend. 
The of munich police is reinforced by seven policemen of the Tirol of the South, by voluntary rescuers Italians that support the Bavarian red cross that realizes a statistics on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with near of 200 medical interventions. 
The one that particularly is appreciated Italians, this is stretched it brewery Hofbräu. 
Insomnia nights for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate 
The German bank system is comparatively stable, insisted the federal Minister of the Finances some weeks ago only. 
Which luck that the politician used the word `relativement' and that it slipped that the sector banker German would not be saved by the crisis movements. 
This one is in fact arising this weekend. 
The financial one of the Bavarian real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), side to the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a credit of a billion to protect itself from the turbulences of the markets. 
A person in the position confidence said to Reuters Monday that the assistance credits are delivered until an amount of 35 billion Euros. 
The Hypo Real Estate henceforth should pay interests on the fraction to the which one she would have thus straight. 
Money originates as much private banks that of banks of public right. 
In background, this is the corporation girl Depfa that bears the losses. 
The financial one of state was itself, according to a newspaper item, refinancé to very short term for projects in the long term for which it had borrowed money - which no longer is possible since owing to the mistrust towards the markets. 
To the first part of the year 2008, the reserve of liquidities of the bank had been reduced of 95 percent to 2.37 million Euros, the rate of own capital also lightly had weakened of 1.6 to 1.45 percent. 
The profits in course and those net originating financial transactions were, in comparison with the same period the preceding year, fallen to the point zero, the profits originating granting of credits and of movable determined values as well as provision termination in the credit operations had fallen more than 70 percent to 5 million Euros. 
And this only thanks to the important pulled profits of the reimbursement of the costs of accounting downstream originating restructuring of the former group Depfa, as well as reimbursement of the interests according to the book of the fiscal procedures and commercial purchases for the businesses of Konzern that the deficit of the gains of about 16 percent proved themselves to be moderated. 
After his privatization in 1990, the financial old one of state had first of all poorly speculated on industrial real estate credits, that next had been filialisés to the bank Aareal. 
Because what the financing of classical state was not rather profitable, the Depfa next had engaged itself more intensely in the projects of infrastructures and in the project financing in common between private investors and State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally. 
On the value of the corporation girl, the Hypo Real Estate must proceed to cushionings that should have on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group an essential material effect that remains nonetheless rather fuzzy. 
The fact is that the dividends were amputated. 
Already for 2007, they had been truncated to the two third. 
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the buyback of the Depfa, an investor of state and of highly important infrastructures. 
She is solider than other institutes depending on the refinancement on the interbank market since she does not possess any deposit of customers. 
With the bankruptcy of the bank of investment Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, credit granting between banks is themselves again considerably dried up, the banks having accumulated their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs yearly for a party - about 50 billion Euros - body of the credits of the Depfa of a means in the short one run of refinancement. 
According to a communiqué of the Hypo Real Estate, the need of financing of the group is covered with the credit to average term and the protected business of the influence of the international financial widely unable markets market currently. 
Of other sources say that the refinancement would be assured thanks to the funds until at the end of 2009. 
The president of the committee board of directors of HRE Georg Funke explained on the other hand that the group Hypo Real Estate not more should must to resort to to the financial markets to average term. 
The federal Bank and the federal Establishment for the Supervision of the Financial Services (Bafin) leave the principle that the capacity of the group Hypo Real on the market henceforth is assured. 
The shareholders and the bank creditors no longer have than to hope it. 
Nevertheless, to the view of the dynamics and impondérabilité of the crisis, it does not exist any certainty. 
This is not besides unthinkable that it be not necessary to resort to to the financing in all extensive sound. 
But the not opposite can more not be separated. 
After the Fact that the bank be, according to the last communiqués, again to the doors of the insolvency Sunday in evening end, this salvage for the less provisional one will not succeed reassuring the not spirits more. 
The action course collapsed of 75 percent to 3.30 Euros. 
The obligation courses, on the other hand, carry themselves particularly well. 
While the debts to the first boss have scarcely budged, the courses of the ready ones of second plan bend. 
The most touched ones are especially the funds of investment of the former corporation girl Württemberg Hypo and those well heard that have a life length beyond 2009. 
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate seemed beforehand to be a placement of alternate speculation, henceforth their value must be considered as depending on the stability of the system banker international after net hardening of the bank crisis and crisis of the same institute that did to enter the crisis in the establishment by the buyback of the bank Depfa. 
As long as the transmission institutes, the governments and commercial less touched banks are again ready to support the system, one can presume an arrears résorption in the times. 
Or will well arrive what no one dares to hope in this moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the 15 next months. 
But facing the noises renouvellés of a partial nationalization, the probability that approached the sureté today became a simple founded hope. 
That should reserve nights of insomnia before all to the creditors in the long term on the knowledge decision themselves they must separate themselves of their engagements. 
The investors in the short one always run can use this on what they pulled a trait to constitute a loss continuation for the next years on the next tax on the income of the capitals of the stock market automatically removed gains.

When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years, must present itself for the first day to the Highschool of Tachibana, the girls begin to laugh pouffer: the German one is so "kawaii"! 
Qu'est-ce-que that wants to say? 
Sylvana connait already this word thanks to the Ate - in his new Log of exchanges, she talks about Japan. 
"The first day of course to Japan. 
Qu'est-ce-que I was excited. 
Already the way to go to the school scared me. 
I live in periphery of Tokyo heading for Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to the Highschool of Tachibana. 
I have of the to find the way all alone, fortunately I did not lose myself. 
The course beginning does not seem to be set up in a manner as strict as at our place down below saxe. 
The students appear after one another from eight hours, until what at nine o'clock less twenty, a table turn begins with the professor, the "home room". 
But before the course does not begin, it was to me to present me. 
I not at all am kind to like to speak in front of people, particularly in front of a class of 40 students. 
As I had not again the uniform of the school, I put an old skirt of my mother of welcome, as well as a shirt, socks amounts blue and shoes in black leathers. 
In this held therefore, I presented myself in front of the desk, and tried of all to pronounce correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana. ..’. - I am called Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week. 
At that very moment, I was very happy to have begun learning the language it there well two years. 
The 31 girls of the class all did the low masses, pouffé of laugh and does the signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii". 
I knew it already thanks to my ate. 
It belongs to the essential vocabulary to the survival of the Japanese ados and means "darling, cabbage". 
Next I quickly slipped myself to my place. 
The girl next to me did me a big one to smile ironic, she found that it was an honor that the correspondent must sit next to her. 
The hour remainder was rather calm, but when the gong resounded, I was assailed in the rules. 
Everyone spoke to that better better, pouffait of laugh and put me a lot of questions - in this case, this is rather difficult to understand the English Japanese. 
During the pause, they have then all exits their Bento. 
My welcome mother also had done me this kind of Lunchbox - this is really something else as the miserable ones in German cases. 
I had rice to aromatic grasses, small sausages, a salad of cucumber and of seaweeds, fruit and a meat sort surround by Tofu. 
Most of the time, I have no idea of what I eat exactly here to Japan. 
The things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste. 
What is sure is that all is really good. 
Good, except maybe the preserved salty plums, brrrr! 
The Bentos are not only lunches in the Japanese schools. 
It arrives sometimes that a girl offers to a boy a Bento that she prepared itself, and that then is prepared particularly carefully - in the hope to be able to do a little better the knowledge of the boy during the pause. 
I read that in my ate. 
I am curious knowledge if I could observe it also here. 
"Why Japan in particular?" asked me my girlfriends when I related for them that I wanted to pass a year to the school to Tokyo. 
I then always replied: 
"Because that fascinates me, what" 
In the last analysis, read of the ate, this I already prefer since years. 
And in order more better to understand the ate and the culture that itself there is located, to a moment, I also began learning the Japanese. 
For me, it was really clear that I there had to travel a day. 
Because I have also a weak one for the traditions, the us and the customs. 
And here, one gives them a lot of importances. 
On one hand, Japan is the country of the technologies and tendencies more recent - of another side, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional. 
And as all so is well organized, I did never feel lost here, even if Tokyo is the biggest city than I never saw." 
The rats also have sensations 
A rat or a sneaky one flees in front of the danger, is which that wants to say that it feels also fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced some: a lot of animals have also sensations. 
But how can one to verify that it tests the same thing when it behaves of the same manner that we? 
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions are published for a number of years by of scientific celebrate. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of items of the responses to the question "That you think to be true without being able to have the proof?" 
I believe that the animals have sensations and of other states of conscience without that me or do not import that of other have not until now been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that the other human beings have a conscience. 
But in that case, one can at least to hope that all the human brains present the same configuration. 
As soon as we turn ourselves towards of other types and that we approach the questions of the felt one or usually conscience, we penetrate in with difficulty feasible lands because the Hardware does not correspond. 
When a rat is in front of a danger, it does it same thing that a lot of animal others: it does the death, flees or attacks. 
The human beings behave of the same manner, this is the reason why certain scientific some deduct a comparable subjective screw. 
Nevertheless, I does not there believe. 
Two aspects of the structure of the brain return the transposition of our subjective screw to the one of the difficult animals. 
One of the aspects is that the associated circuits almost always to the human conscience include the lateral Cortex préfrontal (owing to his participation in the memory in the short one run and in the functions of direction and of execution). 
This vast region a lot more is developed with the human beings than with the other primates and seems to be completely leaves with of other beings. 
All the less therefore for these aspects of our conscience that depend on the Cortex préfrontal, among which these the conscience of that we are, and the capacity to foresee and to decide, it is reasonable to suppose that the human being is different even of the other primates. 
Another significant characteristic could lie in the linguistic nature of the Man: a big party of his existence being linked to the language, that means often that his conscience in depends. 
In this case, one could exclude the animals. 
But even if the conscience did not have to depend on the language, this one would influence it surely, so that the animal conscience, whatever the manner of which she is produced, is different probably a lot of most of our states of conscience. 
This is for that that it is so difficult to determine to what can resemble the conscience with of animal others. 
If that, internal and subjective, does not leave itself or to measure or, owing to this special Hardware, analyze while basing on our own experience, then his observation puts us big problems. 
Most of my developments prohibitionists the content of the conscious screw, but it exists side issue another aspect of the conscience that should be more more more easily more accessible scientifically. 
One could examine the processes of conscience of the animals without taking account of their content, and this is exactly what happened at the time of studies on the memory in the short one run of the primates, particularly with the visualization example. 
But in this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one concentrates more on the nervous correlations of the conscience than on the causal mechanisms: the two can be identical or not. 
Curious, this approach underlines also the weight of the Cortex préfrontal in the visualization realization. 
But that in does it result then for the emotions? 
I in conclude that an emotional system such as the one of the fear is activated in a conscious brain of his own activity. 
Which we designate as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we are located when the activity of the system of localized defense in the brain (or its continuations, as the body reactions) monopolizes lively memory. 
Thus observed, the emotions narrowly are linked to the cortex regions that characterize the primates and all particularly the Man. 
Of subtle degrees of the felt one, associated with our nature volubile, release themselves, because we can, with the assistance of the words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to ascribe them to others that to us even. 
To the opposed, Antonio Damasio for example thinks that the sensations originating primitive activities are born in the regions of the bodily sensation of the Cortex and cerebral trunk, just as Jaak Pankseep that concentrates nevertheless more on the cerebral trunk. 
As this network not a lot modified itself during the course of the human evolution, it can completely participated transverse sensations in all kind. 
From the standpoint purely theoretical, I cannot contradict it, but I believe that indémontrable. 
Pankseep deduces on account of the fact that which figures as fear with the Men and with the rats probably also is felt as such in the two cases: how can one nevertheless to verify if the rats and the Men feel the same thing when they behave in a manner similar? 
A sneaky one flees in front of the danger, but if it feels fear? 
To my eyes, similar behaviors not suffisent to prove identical screws. 
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: the rats and the Men possess similar cerebral trunks, the sneaky on the other hand do not possess even a brain. 
But is-which the cerebral trunk is at the sensation origin? 
And even if one could prove that for the Man: how can one to show it with the rats? 
I believe that the rats and other mammals, maybe even the sneaky ones (that knows?) have sensations. 
But I would not know how to show it. 
And because their sensations are different probably completely of the ours (since the human conscience rests on special circuits and on the language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior that the emotional sensations of the rats. 
In any case, progress break through on the nervous plan in the measure where one gauge it same thing with the rats and with the Man. 
As I do not explore the language and the conscience with the rats, or the sensations, I do not know themselves they exist. 
One could judge that as in the short one run, but I prefer to advance rather than to bang me constantly against a wall. 
I am in fact a pragmatic émotionel. 
Platini, president of the UEFA: a grace delay for the Poland and the Ukraine 
The assistant Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations soon would be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister. 
"The government considers the decision of the UEFA to Bordeaux as a confidence proof in the Ukraine and in his capacity to organize, in collaboration with the Poland, the championships of Europe", announced Wasjunik. 
"But this is not an amnesty for our country. 
The work comes just to begin, and there is again a lot to do in the two countries." 
In the calendar of the construction or destruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the delays. 
The number of stadiums for the championship of Europe eventually could be reduced of eight to six. 
"We not more can lose time. 
We must work to maximum speed", declared the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis. 
"The UEFA has us constantly to the eye". 
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland. 
The direction of the league of Polish soccer PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator. 
The commission had met on the request of the Minister of the Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
It would exist "a true danger that the PZPN be not able to act in the rules", declared Drzewiecki of the agency of Polish press PAP. 
"We assured in a mail to the President of the UEFA that the preparations of the European Championship of 2012 not about it would suffer." 
Several members of the league of First Division were, already in the preceding season, condemned for manipulation of obligatory relegation; in the last analysis, the beginning of the League has even of the to be shifted to the last minute. 
Dennis Quaid indignant counter-attacks 
She wanted to do the promotion for a new film, talked about his private life in an interview - and has now boredoms with his former one: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan got up the sail on his born one of adultery former Dennis Quaid. 
It foams - and counter-attacks. 
A war of the late Roses for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors deliver themselves to a battle disgracieuse - to the view and to the everyone knowledge. 
Last week, Meg Ryan had expressed itself in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was me during a long time unfaithful, and it was very painful." 
She would have peruseed the deception range only after the divorce. 
The motive of this striptease of the thought lies in the relations of press of Ryan for his new film "The Women" - there is related the history of an adulterous one. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on his qualification of unfaithful husband clearly fell: this would be "Monstrous", said this one to the "New York Daily New", 54 years, that "Meg remâche a new time the history of our relation and the handles". 
This would be of more "unfortunate", that "the penalty and the upheavals that behave a divorce for every child be again revived in public" for their common son of 16 years Jack." 
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and will become soon the father of twins. 
Was thus his response to the claw swipe: "In any case, my continuous life. 
I estimate myself happy to have a wonderful family that goes to the better". 
The prices of the bills of airplane and hotels fall 
In the first half of the year 2008, the flights and the hotel nights were less dear than the preceding year. 
In Germany, according to a current study, the flights even would be reduced even has 50 percent. 
The flights and the hotel nights would be returned to normalcy advantageous - this is the result of a study of the contractor of financial services and of trips American Express. 
The business analyzed its data of reservations of the first part of the year of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a net decrease of the profits in the second quarter. 
After the prices on the hotel market increased during years, the hotel nights already reduced in a lot of places. 
Of January to March, the prices increased in 41 of the 48 European examined cities again of 6.9 percent in average in comparison with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European examined cities. 
Of April to June, the prices were nevertheless already 3.6 percent more bottom than the preceding year. 
The tendency was net especially to Paris and to Rome, where the travelers must paid of 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier. 
The causes of all that would live for American Express in the weak course of the dollar that drove to an "envies trips in decrease of the American tourists". 
The financial places such as Frankfurt or London would be of even more touched ones by the decline of the prices of the hotels than the industrial sites as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Swedish city, the hotel prices are held with an increase of 26.3 percent, the record in Europe. 
Also in price matter of the flights, the tendency was at the increase in the first quarter: 
Owing to the increase of the price of the kerosene, the passengers in class economical have pay in average 7.1 percent of more than in 2007, the long flights mail, very consumers of fuel, even increased until 29.2 percent. 
Of April to June, the bills prices in class economical fell in average of 12.5 percent in comparison with the preceding quarter, in class matter and in first class nevertheless, the price variations widely less were pronounced. 
In Germany, the prices knew an even more important fall that in the other European countries: 
Of January to March, the prices had increased of 11.9 percent, in the second quarter, they fell of 23.6 percent. 
The German internal flights even were divided by two according to this study. 
The reasons of this fall of the prices would be on one hand an economical growth bending, explains the firm. 
The request would yield ground in a lot of segment of the market of the trips by airplane. 
Of another side, it would exist a stressed pressure of the competition of by the treaty "Sky open" that liberalizes the aerial circulation between the United States and Europe. 
Sign stretched position is the suppression by the airline companies of the non profitable trips, as well as the high number of airline companies that would have deposited the report during the first part of the year 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe alone. 
Beaten HSV Gladbach 1:0 
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first of classification. 
In the Borussia, Luhukay did not not yet succeed finding an eleven functional one. 
Of Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Landing in catastrophe for international player Sea Marko. 
The player of Gladbach returned only late in the game and his raised shooting failed against the goal framework. 
His message precisely was formulated, it had gone out of its in a manner persuasive lips. 
It knew all simply that it had reason. 
"We need this second goal", whistled Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the vestiaires of the arena of Hamburg. 
It did not happen big thing in the vestiaires, the part-time one was finished and the most had sat to their place. 
Rieger was during near of three decades the physiothérapeute of the HSV, it enjoys a big reputation as well of former protagonists. 
And this is the reason why his request was received to the strategic places. 
The entraineur assistant Cornelius Jol has acquiesé and got up the thumb to approve. 
Cornelius is the brother of the entraineur in boss of Hamburg Martin Jol. 
Of which the orders seem to have been similar: and that that jumps with this second goal! 
The placement in practice lacked. 
"All was not very beautiful to see today", acknowledged later Marcel Jansen. 
Bastian Reinhard would have "wished also more to be relaxed". 
This 1:0 (1:0 to the part-time one), the team of Hamburg has it to one hit with the head successful by Mladen Petric (to the 11st minute); and the Fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not do poorly to the weak players of Hamburg. 
"That was a dirty victory", summarized Sea Jol. 
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate this Monday its 121 years. 
Already Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the pictures of provisional classification on the gigantic screen that indicated their club as first of the class. 
Ca will be a birthday without true party. 
"We know to take decline", said Marcell Jansen. 
It doubts himself that the intermediary result of the picture reflects more the character imprévisible of the first League than the domination of his HSV. 
The team with its lately engaged arrivals - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the custodian of goal Petric just as debauched Jansen of the FC Bayern - forms itself of course gently, but she does not shine again. 
"We need more charm and of more of dribble", demanded Jol. 
After vote failure 
To Wall Street, the fear circulates. 
The first new one failure of the plan of salvage did to fall the Dow Jones temporarily of 700 points. 
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of all the history. 
Later, the Dow Jones a little recovered itself. 
Towards 20h30, the most important stock market index to the world côtait 10,579 points with a decrease of well five percent. 
The index of stock market of the technologies Nasdaq was at 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points. 
The most lost ones of the Dow Jones were at this date American Express that lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent. 
No title not more could retrieve profits. 
The actions of the Bank Goldman Sachs accused a decrease of almost ten percent. 
Some days ago only, the big investor Warren Buffet had associated itself with the corporation. 
In the framework of the plan of salvage, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what one calls papers hypothécaires spoiled. 
The sum nevertheless must not be poured in once, but progressively. 
In compensation, the State should recover options on the actions of the financial corporation that correlative will be able to be exchanged to the evolution of the course in order some to reduce the load for the Public Treasure. 
The courses of the inhaled actions in the whirlwind in Europe and to the United States 
The billion helps for the banks in Europe and to the United States do not compensate for to the worries of the investors. 
The course of the action of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax towards the bottom. 
The American index of the Dow Jones collapses despite the salvage of the financial market foreseen by the State. 
Spectacular decreases of the courses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank drove the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit. 
The action of the financial real estate one Bavarian lost by moment three quarters of his value despite the operation of salvage of the federal government and of private banks, the Commerzbank accused a decrease of more than 20 percent. 
The Dax clearly slipped underneath the important psychological bar of the 6000 points and itself côtait to 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent. 
In the entire world, the action markets fell kneeling. 
To New York, Wall Street opened with sensitive losses. 
The investors feared that the plan of heavy salvage of 700 billion dollars of the government of the United States cannot be sufficient to get going again the financial markets. 
The Dow Jones to 10.809,25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent. 
The House of Representatives of the United States had the intention to vote from the viewpoint of salvage, the vote to the Senate should follow the 1st October. 
The other European stock markets also knew only a direction: to London, the index FTSE 100 accused a decrease for the moment of 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 to Paris lost 2.9 percent. 
In Asia, the principal Japanese index Nikkei fell to 11.743,61 points after an increase at the start of 1.26 percent.

The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed to the 23 new millions of actions. 
The commercial and tourist multinational corporation has of more makes known than the actions will not be sold to Thomas Cook. 
Dark matter influences the flight of the spatial probes 
Since years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves the researchers in the perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of the spatial probes during what one calls the maneuvers of gravitational support. 
The experts fear that the general theory of relativity be not completely correct. 
Since almost 18 years, the spatial probe "Ulysses" flies in the space. 
Owing to conductions of soon frozen fuels, the dead cryogène threatens it. 
Since years, a mysterious phenomenon is causes confusion among the researchers - the abnormality of the gravitational support. 
The gravitational support is a maneuver of the spatial probes, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth for example. 
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuels. 
The probe of research américo-européenne cassini-huygens used this physical shrewdness, just as the solar probe Ulysses. 
This is what astonishes the researchers besides since years: the flying objects do not always behave to 100 percent of the manner of which one awaits it according to the venerable laws of the gravitation. 
Well more, irregularities appear at the level of speed. 
The probes become in a manner unexpected quicker or slower. 
Until now, the physicists could not explain this effect. 
They baptized it the abnormality of the gravitational support. 
Certain experts feared that the theory of general relativity of Albert Einstein, that describes the force of attraction of the matter owing to the space curvature, cannot be completely correct. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton always believes hard as iron that Einstein did not be mistaken and tries to explain the abnormality of the gravitational support using what one calls the black matter that the astronomers identified in the universe. 
"The black matter could be responsible of this abnormality, matter that is located also nearby of the Earth", it writes. 
The space researchers know the existence of the black matter only since about ten years. 
It emanates apparently of her an attraction force of which the effect is observable on of other celestial bodies. 
Not she, on the other hand, is completely invisible, c'est-à-dire that she does do not send does do or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, all particularly any visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists, the black matter would represent anyway a fifth voucher of the entire mass of the universe. 
The removed tourists in Egypt are free 
After ten days to the hands of their abductors, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be liberated as well as the Minister of the Italian Foreign Affairs confirmed it. 
The Sudanese abductors had demanded a ransom of several million Euros. 
During the shooting preceding the liberation, six takers of hostage would have been killed. 
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were removed. 
The negotiations for the ransom already would be engaged. 
The Germans are continually in the collimator of kidnappers. 
WELT ONLINE depicts the cases more important. 
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free. 
This is what communicated together the television of Egyptian state, the chain of Arabic television Al Arabija and the Italian media. 
The Italian Minister of the French Foreign Affairs Frattini confirmed the liberation after the bulletins of the chain of Italian television Sky TG 24: "Our fellow-countrymen and the other hostages were liberated. 
We are verifying their health state", related Frattini. 
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian accompanists carry themselves well and are in security, announced the national television Egyptian. 
The 19 participants of the excursion in the desert already should be in road towards Cairo. 
The circumstances around a shooting before the liberation of the hostages still remain fuzzy: thus, the kidnappers would have been near to put an end to the abduction, according to the say of an agent of Egyptian security, before the Sudanese army does not kill six of the kidnappers without screaming parks. 
"The problem was resolved. 
They agreed with a ransom", declared the agent. 
It no longer remained than to collect the hostages", when sudden, "this surprise" produced itself. 
Sudanese soldiers had cut down this Sunday six of the abductors in the border zone between the Soudan, the Chad and Egypt, and had stopped two of them. 
The takers of hostage had demanded Germany a ransom of an amount of six million Euros; money had to be put back by the German woman of one of the hostages. 
The Newspaper "El Masri El Jom" declared that, according to the say of a German mediator, the liberation of the hostages took delay because the kidnappers feared for their security. 
According to the item, the abductors wanted to liberate the feminine hostages after the ransom payment. 
The men had to be kept until the abductors found a sure road to flee. 
The German embassy to Cairo refused to do all commentary on this narrative. 
Abuse of a father-in-law" that took to the suicide" 
A court was informed that of the years of abuse inflicted by his father-in-law took a woman to itself suicide. 
Michael Trerise, 57ANS, of Stithians, in the Cornwalls, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight bosses of accusation for ways of indecent facts. 
The high court of Truro referred that it uniformly secured his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, of 5 to 7 years. 
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: ". I feel responsible of his death". 
The court was informed that Melle Randle, 34 years old, committed suicide at her place to Mutley, Plymouth, the 1st April 2007. 
Child when she lived to Coventry, Trerise had attached it and bandaged before to force it to sexual acts, while his mother worked to the pub. 
Trerise and his woman divorced in the years 80, and it returned to live in the Cornwalls. 
His daughter-in-law left for Plymouth. 
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, volunteer constant of National Trust, was haunted abuses that had been inflicted him two times a week. 
The general prosecutor, Ramsey Quaife declared to the court that of the friends had related that Melle Randle, that was a good surfer and cyclist, seemed since 2006 "emotionally dead", and "had lost all hope towards life." 
In April 2007, his true father, Terrance Randle, found it dead in his apartment to Plymouth. 
One thinks that she committed suicide while suffocating with a bag in plastic. 
Mr. Randle confronted the beautiful father of his girl that had besides, composed a confession letter that finished thus: "I attached it and bandaged it uniformly". 
"I did not abuse her sexually. 
"I feel responsible of his death." 
The judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are really strange as fétichiste, your victim certainly had to be terrorized, especially at the age of 7 years. 
"This unpleasant saga finished by the suicide of the victim. 
And what again more astonishing is the Fact that if she never had not committed this gesture, his history certainly would be finished to the court". 
It added: "I underline in particular, such as describe it his father and his mother, the effects of your crime commit during years on Stéphanie. 
"Without these, she would be doubtless today a young happy, promising woman, and of success." 
Condemnation for loss of official data. 
The ministerial officer of the Office Office that had forgotten documents top secret, in June on a train, will be condemned by the Secret Official Act, knew the BBC. 
The man of the Ministry of the Defense was on the move when it forgot two highly classified documents, on a train heading for Waterloo. 
The documents are passed in the hands of the before being delivered BBCS to the police. 
Here the condemnation the less engraves of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intention. 
The correspondent of the BBC, Frank Gardner declared that this episode had a lot the people of Whitehall. 
"They will have thought that this matter would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of the Defense and Office Office" it declared. 
The employee that cannot be named, is accused violation of the section 8,1 of the act, clause c'est-à-dire that treats safeguard of the news. 
. The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer is placed under the guardianship of the Metropolitan Police, seen the very sensitive nature of his work linked to the Associated Committee of the Secret Services 
The documents that it lost contained assessments on Al Qaeda as well as on the resources of the security forces in Iraq. 
It was informed decision, Monday morning and next was transported of at his place towards a secret place. 
Building corporations facing the bill B&B. 
The British corporations of the building could must to pay a bill of more of £80 million, to cover the salvage of the bank Bradford & Bingley. 
The Government furnished £14 billions to protect the deposits of the 2,6 millions of saving Bradford & Bingleys. 
The interests of this ready one will be paid by all the corporations that harvest savings money, including 59 corporations of the building. 
The general director of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles declared that it is "irritating" of knowledge that the corporations and their members will have to pay the jars broken… 
The ready one of £14 billions will be reimbursed when the hypothèques of Bradford & Bingleys will be released. 
But the interests that go at the same time to increase, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that harvest the deposits. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC, that the 59 corporations of the building are included in this list. 
This is irritating to see that the institutions that had a prudent behavior… now must pay certain of the bills of the institutions that were a lot less prudent ones. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
One proclaims that every corporation must pay a proportional sum to the deposits that she holds, and that the intermediary corporations must pay about 18% of the cost. 
The Treasure considers that the interests of the ready one will rise in 2009, to £450MILLIONS. 
That wants to say that the corporations will have to find £81 million to regulate the interests of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, general director of the commercial committee of the corporations of the building, declared to the BBC that this decision seemed to him unfair. 
This is" irritating" to see that the institutions that had a prudent behavior at the time of the return of the real estate market, now must pay for the a lot institutions less prudent. 
According to the BSA, no corporation failed since 1945, dates back to the first annals. 
"We must examine all the aspects of this matter during the next weeks, to evaluate the options to adopt to avoid that the corporations of the building and their members pay this salty bill" declared Mr. Cole. 
The interests for 2009 cover seven months, of at the end of September of this year until at the end of March. 
In 2010, it will be necessary to pay the interests of the entire year, that can besides to double. 
Seen that the building corporations are organizations without shareholder, their member end up to pay the bill be by higher loads, or by inferior interest rate for the accounts saves. 
Milk increases until five penny to the liter 
The people of Jersey must pay more for their milk 
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to increase the wholesale price of his milk, of five penny to the liter, from Monday.

The dispute starts with the radiation in December 2006 of nine American prosecutors formulated by the Department of American Justice. 
To the era, the department had declared that the prosecutors were dismissed for causes mediocre benefits. 
But it emerged next, that the dismissed prosecutors not more were criticized than their other colleagues, what incited certain observers to attribute to these dismissals a political connotation. 
Certain of the prosecutors were accused to be close of the Republicans of the Congress, while of others would have refused to investigate about the accusations of vote frauduleux against the Democrats.

A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and can Etre Soon in Sale. 
New York has access to hundreds of avenues, of boulevards, of streets and of other parallel roads, some celebrate, of only functional others. 
. And even certain taxis veterans as well as local residents of long date do not never know to give indications to go to first rate Place, for they some heard to speak. 
The street is located in the East Town and traverses the north of First Street- to not to confuse with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue. 
Of about 30 feet of wide one for 120 of long one, she resembles a dusty avenue rather than to an active artery. 
. No panels indicate the street. 
It is potentially impossible to find it on a standard atlas. 
This street has nevertheless admirers. 
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent buildings of luxury on First Street. 
It would want to repave first rate Place, and create a more fluid passage towards the stores and the shops, that should open in the new buildings. 
Of other admirers including neighbors of long date, declared being charmed by this short cut simply because there remains one of the last and more former streets of the pâté of houses. 
But the Department of Preservation and real estate Development of the city that manages the street, has no interest to keep it. 
This month, at the time of a meeting of the committees of owners of neighborhood, representatives of city agency and of Avalon Bay sketched a suggestion authorizing the real estate builder to buy the street. 
But the committee prefers that the street remains in the city hands, and asked a new suggestion to submit next month, declared Susan Stetzer, to manage it local of the Committee n°3. 
"It remains only few spaces belonging to the city, and we would wish that the city preserves first rate Place" she declared. 
"They could propose to repair it and to manage it, which besides Avalon could do, but we wish to maintain it public." 
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repave the small street and there to install seats, some would be besides used by a coffee to which one the builder will grant the space. 
The suggestion of this acquisition potentielle was rendered public to the meeting of this month. 
Michele of Milly, the door word of Avalon Bay, declared that although the corporation want to exploit the street, that does not want necessarily to say that she want to be the owner. 
"The principal interest of Avalon Bay is relooker this abandoned avenue, and to render public it" she declared, underlining that this was the city to him to suggest the sale". 
Seth Donlin, a door word of the Preservation of the real estate one, confirmed that the city wished well to sell the street, underlining in addition, that the agency mission was to develop the property rather than to manage it. 
Compared to his more colored neighbor, Bowery, first rate Place left a light historic impression. 
Some believe that first rate Place carries this name since 1802, when the inheritance of the big farm of the numerous children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving quotation this small end of earth, that remained since abandoned. 
The posterior entry of the CBGB, a rock punk monument closed in 2006, has ré open to first rate Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo in cover of the album of Sweep" Rocket à Russia" 
"This place was magnificent" declared Danny Fields, to manage it of the Sweep, that took the photo in November 1976. 
She was full of scrap, of rags, barrels, post, of leaves and of ropes." 
Certain residents, including the bloggeurs that already had talked about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Town, opposed themselves to the idea to sell first rate Place, saying that this small humble property should remain public. 
Of others proclaimed first rate Place as a true rarity- a fragment potentially the same as the city that should be rotten in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, that drives a person known as blog Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of the Disputes: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look on A City in the Process of Extinction") relates the history of the City and first rate Place, published in 1952 in new The Yorker. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "First rate Place is a small bottom-of-narrow, dark bag of day as of night, and delimited by the doors of a warehouse in rusty iron and shutters, a lot of newspapers of the past week that fly away themselves alongside the gutters." 
To few exceptions near, the street always has it same pace. 
A rat runs nimbly at the far end of the lane, close to a door that took formerly to the CBGB, and that now became the seat of a store of chic clothing. 
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer of 22 ounces empties, rests to quoted of newspapers that come just to be thrown. 
Some passes declared thinking only rarely to first rate Place, and suggested his placement in value. 
Mr. Field, of his quotation, declared thinking that certain under estimated the street attraction in his current state. 
"The better years of my life" it declared, "unfolded themselves in dark, humid places and disgusting". 
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English language 
In this party of the program of Supervision of the Education, Bruce Fuller and Launches T. Izumi discuss the position of the candidates about the bilingual education. 
Launch T. Izumi, former member of the studies in California, and former director of the department of education to the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the book co-author "not as Good as You did not Think it. Why the average classes must be able to choose their school. " 
Attract the favors of the votes Hispanics is a complicated business. 
The suggestions of Barack Obama on the education some are an interesting example. 
The country of Mr. Obama underlines that "the African-American students and Latino have less than luck to award a degree to itself that the white students." this is a fact véridique. 
To fight these differences, the program of education of Mr. Obama supports in particular among subject so many others, "the transitional bilingual education" for those that learn the English. 
Nevertheless, the question that puts itself for Obama is knowledge if his desire to realize a bilingual education that defends the instruction in class of other languages that the English, goes besides his interest aiming to eliminate the differences. 
Take for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school of the east of the story of Los Angeles. 
The students of this school are in big majority Hispanics, and of returned bottoms. 
More of a third of the students, constituted many new arrivals, student the English. 
Among the students of the CM1, 100% passed the examination of State of maths of 2008, level expert. 
All the same, almost 93% of the students passed the anglais-de examination languages-d one' arts 
This unbelievable success was attained thanks to another ingredient that the one advanced by Mr. Obama. 
Sixth Street put on analyses, practice, a constant evaluation of the capacities as well as an exemplary attitude. 
What's more, and here an example that Mr. Obama could copy, retrieves Linda Mikels, principal of the Sixth Street, this school established the instruction of the English language" full immersion". 
The total immersion in English language focuses on the almost constant usage of the English in the instruction. 
Melle Mikels, in contrast to the bilingual education, asserted me "we had a huge success with a student that had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months after, if you went without his class, you would have had no luck to identify it." 
"That walks, she observes," that walked for us" 
Mr. Obama not it should take example of the Sixth Street Prep and to retort it in the other schools composed in majority of students Hispanics learning the English. 
The excellent results obtained by this school talk about themselves; but the political ones on the education inside his party (the Associations for the National Education support since a long time the bilingual education) and his huge support in favor of the bilingual education, obscure forecasts it response of Mr. Obama. 
Although it in favor of the fact the immigrants learn the English, Mr. Obama recently considered this question as insignificant, when it proclaimed that we all must stop debating on the made out one laws in English language. 
"On the contrary, it declared," you must assure yourself that your child speaks Spanish". 
If Mr. Obama wishes really to eliminate the differences, it then should consider with attention, the education models that work, rather than to disdain them or to consider them as insignificant. 
Net fall of the Oil after the New Worries of the world of the Economy

To the same moment, the governments More belgian, More dutch and Luxembourger have in left nationalized financial European conglomerate, Fortis. 
The analysts of Barclays Capital declared that the frantic negotiations of this week end, concluded with the salvage agreement" seem not to have succeeded let the market relive".

The bank analysts reduced their expectations for the next year, seen the falls of the consumptions of due oils to the slowdown of the economical growth, were therefore obliged to diminish of 20POUR hundred, the anticipations of the prices of the oil and gas for 2009. 
The party of the Second Time Determining for the Improvement of the Record of the Equipe. 
After passing at the time of these eight last seasons, more time that whoever in uniform of the Throws Shaun Ellis, the defender thought all to have seen. 
It looked at the second time, when the Throws transformed a 0 to 0 in an explosion. 
"I did never see anything of this kind" declared Ellis. 
The second time began after the Throws and the Cardinal Arizona have played salement under of obscure clouds. 
Then the quarter back Brett Favre succeeded doing a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, signs forerunner of an afternoon during which their relation did a leap forward. 
Favre found Coles for again two other touchdowns, the first when a corner kick back fell and the second, to 10 seconds of the part-time one. 
"I did not go out of my zone" Favre declared about all its pass to Coles. 
"this is a mediocre player" 
"We communicated extremely well, despite what think the people."

Darrelle Relives, dog-ear back, intercepted a lost shooting and did 32 yards to THE touchdown. 
Eric Smith did another passes and intercepted it. 
Linebacker, David Bowens left to escape the ball because of Warner. 
To the last change, the loss of the ball of Bowens, well being the event more charming 
The Cardinal ones took the check of this possession during the 10 last seconds, and next the Throws recovered the ball, Jay Feely did a goalkeeper of 20 yards taking an advantage of 34 to 0. 
It was the better than the Throws were able to mark in a time. 
"The coach of the Throws, Eric Mangini, to that one asked to describe this madness, declared" the second time or the third one?" 
When one said for him the two- the Throws left to pass 21 undisputable points in the third time- Mangini declared: "I can say you that I more appreciated the second time than the third one. 
. ". A lot of points were marked in little time." 
Gebrselassie rested, surpasses his world-wide record. 
Haile Gebrselassie, éthiopien has, again proved to be worthy of his title of better racer of bottom of the century, after beating his own record of the world to the marathon of Berlin Sunday becoming thus the first one to run 26.2 thousand in less than 2HEURES and 4MINUTES. 
With a victory in 2: 03: 59 of an accommodating race on the dish, Gebrselassie beat of 27 seconds his record of 2: 04: 26, disputed the last year to Berlin. 
To 35 years, Gebrselassie won the 26th record of the world of his superb career during which it won the World Championship or the world-wide record for any distance, of the 1600MÈTRES marathon. 
The last month, Gebrselassie had lacked the olympic marathon of Beijing, fearing- in a manner can be exaggerated to the eyes of today,- that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems. 
On the contrary, it promit to run to Berlin. 
In almost perfect conditions- sunny time, 48 degrees at the start, 55 to the arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds 
The track racers as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both of them kenyans, convert in bottom racers, contributed to the decrease of the record of the marathon of more than two minutes in these ten last years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won to Berlin in 2:06:05. 
After the victory of Sunday, Gebrselassie declared to the reporteurs, to have suffered from crampes to the soft one two weeks before, and to have lacked the training for a week. 
It is evident that the rest allowed for him brilliant remainder, but done not rust. 
"I am so happy," it declared to the put back. 
"All was perfect. 
I myself there put back last week, and today, I had doubts; but to the end, all went for the better."" 
One reproached for him- especially to the Kenya, the rival is African of the Ethiopia- to have too to orchestrate its races, while avoiding the world-wide stars of the marathon, in cash in fact on the hares as themselves they were in a track competition, and considering more the world-wide records than the direction of the competition. 
But this critic does not diminish the magnitude of the capacities of Gebrselassie as a bottom racer. 
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1: 02: 04. to mi way. 
Two racers of elite kenyans, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the line heads disappeared. 
To a little more than three thousand of the arrival, Gebrselassie did his final ascent to detach itself Kwambai, that finishes second in 2: 05: 36, improving his better personal record of five minutes. 
Kamathis is arrives third in 2:07:48. 
In the feminine race, Irina Mikitenko, been born to the Kazakhstan, now German citizen, finished a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19. 
The English Paula Radcliffe holds the world-wide record of 2:15:25. 
The last spring, 36 years old Mikitenko, surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14. 
She not pût to participate in the games of Beijing because of a hypothetical a back ache, but promit to win to Berlin, improving to his third marathon, his personal record of almost five minutes. 
She ran done recourse to a skillful strategy, leaving the group of racers éthiopiens and Kenyans to take a beautiful advantage, the surpassing next about 18MILES ½ after. 
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, finished third in 2:25:01. 
In a City to Leaves, Pride and the tests of Black Life 
Hidden in the development of his immense park, to some thousand of the sunny one, the brilliant and the gigantic Orlando, is located a small quiet city where are born pride and the complications of the African-American experience. 
"Eatonville, first completely black city to integrate, house of childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, this description that she did in 1935, no longer is so simple to do these days." The city to the five lakes, three short ones of croquet,, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, a lot of guavas, two schools and no prison". 
She now became a pilgrimage city 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival that is held each year to Eatonville, to pay homage to Hurston, the writer more famous of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And of various manners, the city that she describes- became tourist thanks to his inclusion in the tourist guide of the Florida edited by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place to leaves. 
She is so independent, worthy, and deprived that she was not it already in the years 30, when Hurston related that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to divide its true thoughts with the white man, that" knowing us if little, knows what it loses". 
Even if it is a matter of the year of the election of a black president, the Senator Barack Obama, that has besides invoked a dialog open on the race theme, a lot here remain prudent of the look of the foreigner. 
"We are very prudent as for the manner to relate the history" declared Hortense Jones, 59 years, resident since always and the more former parishioner of the city. 
"It is necessary that she be in accordance with the reality. 
Eatonville a long time was defined as a paradox of the triumph and of fight. 
She represents at once a historic model of a taken one of strength of the black as well as a community of almost 2400 persons where the rate of poverty is two times the national average. 
It is a matter of a central point but also of an example of rural Confederate black culture- some disdained times, of other acclaimed times- that recalls the birth of the American slavery. 
Which would explain why the residents are at once proud and protective. 
The interest towards the picture of born Eatonville with Zora, that everyone here calls Hurston. 
She presented his natal city to the entire world through of the sincere books, a lot of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "" Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the guide of the Florida transformed this city, situated just to the go out of Road 17, a road that crosses the center of the Florida, often forgotten, that results in chapter of the black history and human drama. 
Audacious such a big cash register in the life as in the literature, Hurston took the readers to the store of property of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, that next was divided in several private parties. 
"Passed the road on the left", she writes, "you will find the modern public school chestnut and white, with its gardens and these areas of well preserved games of which Howard Miller always took care, although it know scarcely to read and write. 
She did in addition mention of the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that The Glenn" sells drinks of all kind as well as all which can serve to the passage people. 
Therefore, in scarcely about one hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville to a car government but also to the analphabétisation, to remarriage, and to the sex. 
Well evidently, Fodor was not thus. 
This was not in fact a portrait that everyone appreciated. 
Zora well described the reality "declared Ella Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls of Johnson that Hurston immortalized, quoting the songs without color, interpreted by men that rented their beauty." 
She added: "Certain no one did not appreciate". 
One always remembers Hurston as a lively and eccentric person, that returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77 years, recalled that Hurston arrived usually in city without warning, on board of a big Chevrolet, a cigarette to the mouth and carried pants here, where even today, one is to trust the traditional clothes. 
Numerous residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin related, while a lot made fun of of her. 
"The people always were happy to see Zora" it declared. 
But it adds in addition, balancing itself in his chair of the posterior patio that gives on Lake Sabelia, there where Hurston certainly was baptized, that" she never remained too a long time". 
To the death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and its books were out production. 
Eatonville and the entire world seemed to have forgotten it. 
Although she was formerly a star of the literature, a contemporary one of Langston Hughes and the only black woman of the Barnard College of the years 20, she was buried in a grave any, to Strong Pierce, Fla, there where she vécut. 
To Eatonville, no big commemoration, or of plate for the general public. 
I do not think that they understood the contribution or the inheritance that she offers to the world "declared Valérie Boyd, author of" Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of published Hurston in 2003. 
A crucial moment arose in the years 1980. 
Public officials of Orange County wished to let an expressway pass to five ways in city, to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, principal street to two ways of the community. 
The development of Orlando already pushed Interstate 4 until the angle west of the city. 
The suggestion was done while Eatonville put back itself all just one of a difficult period of his history. 
A forced integration, among so many something else, put an end to the isolation comparatively idyllique of the community. 
In the years 50, the dispute on the race mixture took the hate to the community doors. 
"To that era, a band of white young ones came to launch orange or objects against the seated persons on the quotation" declared Mr. Franklin. 
"A lady even deceased. " 
They launched a watermelon of their car". 
In a letter of 1955 address to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questions the request of the Supreme Current aiming at a forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glorifieuse of my race". 
The residents proclaim now that the elimination of the racial segregation in the schools, although positive in certain aspects, diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and has weakens the confidence of the young ones. 
"The black children were used to kisies- I myself in reminder well- one kissed our master in the morning, and evenings also" declared N.Y. Nathiri, girl of Ella Dinkins as well as director in boss of the Safeguard of the Community of Eatonville, a group non-profit. 
That lasted, she added, even the moment teaching them and studying them no longer came from the same place. 
"You do not kiss your white professor because it is white- I want to say that there is here, a line of cultural boundary" declared Melle Nathiri. 
The civil rights, besides, allowed creating space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists that went besides the harm, such as she, army of a joyous own confidence and lines of driving such as: "how they can deprive themselves pleasure of my company!" 
That surpasses me." 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went on the anonymous grave of Hurston and began fighting to let his reputation relive. 
Five years after, an acclaimed biography on Hurston realized by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best to saddle, reintroduced it thus to the American canons. 
The expressway project arrived just the moment the girl more famous of Eatonville had rediscovered his attraction. 
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston consider it as a savior. 
The community began organizing a festival Hurston to show the disastrous consequences that would generate this expressway. 
Hundreds of fans came to the festival inauguration two years after, and a lot return in January, to commemorate it. 
After numerous years, the story pushed back the expressway suggestion. 
"Expressway fiasco to five ways, extremely quick, a true civic pride" declared Melle. Nathiri. 
Melle Boyd summarized the all informer that "Zora saved Eatonville". 
The victory against the expressway project allowed for him to change his own picture. 
Persons non-residents, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer that frequents our church depuis1993, began coming in big number, and the residents began reconsidering the passed. 
Eatonville is classified historic city since 1998. 
A mono library theme (famous well evidently Hurston) ouvra in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repaved. 
Today, Eatonville remains an abnormality for the Florida: to six thousand of Orlando, she can to any moment to consider itself as a rear posterior street at the time of a day of summer, small rain such as she was when she was been founded by 27 black families in the years 1880. 
(one counts today 90 percent of black ones) 
The foreigners that come to discover the history of Eatonville, his reason to be, again are treated with prudence. 
It is necessary to ask the permission for most of the interviews, and certain things- as the walls of the vielle church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields- must not be photographed. 
A lot to Eatonville, as Melle Jones, one teaching courageous and that has a weak one for the red lively one, always have fear that their insular community well is not understood. 
Nevertheless, seen the expansion of the festival Hurston, a certain level of local pride is emerged. 
The young in particular, stretch to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, or better more or worse, but so more proud, more creative, bosseuse, crazy and mixed that the others groups ethnic and racial in America. 
This is well sincere civic affection that one hears in the voice of the nephew of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years, that foresees to come back to Eatonville after the high school to work for the local government or for the forces of Police, that need additional forces. 
And even for the youngest ones, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11ANS, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned correctly the description Eatonville. 
"Most of the people, that pass in that zone, will think:" oh, this city did not compare anything to others" Alondra Kenon declared after the mass Sunday last. 
But if you stop yourself and take the time to contemplate the history, this is a very beautiful city". 
Here to New York, all speak often finances. 
Despite all, nothing changed. 
If the tourists to Manhattan held themselves moved away from the kiosk and gigantic screens of TV to Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the cyclone eye. 
Never they could think only in the offices in glass and in bee nest above suckles for them, the bankers and manage them funds of cover that monopolize New York, pass the worse one" day of work in the office" since the ace of 1929. 
The delivery-men continue to baste itself on the sidewalks, with their carts and their plateaus of muffins for the meetings matinières. 
The latino always lead between the residential buildings carrying, as mules, a group of around fifty shirts luxurious hung to a willing yoke on its shoulders. 
The office employees continue to do the tail to buy their sandwich matinier to the itinerant merchants, and it always is impossible to find a taxi between 16H and 19H in week. 
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic narratives until this afternoon when I decided to be going to open a new account of savings. 
Fortunately that I had planned myself to work in afternoon end, for I discovered to my local affiliate of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty persons doing the tail. 
Not in front of the windows of the cashiers, or to withdraw type or do a payment, but in front of the window of the customer service, there where the habitual customers ordered their checkbooks, the tourists asked the direction for the store Macy, and the new customers opened accounts. 
Most of those in front of me, I would learn later Starr, my "personal authorized banker", did all the tail for the same reason that me. 
Not same manner, for they already had withdrawn their economies of the smaller banks, as the one of the New Jersey, of Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
They withdrew their money of the accounts of person known as savings thrifts (such a building corporation), associations of credit, and the type of local savings banks and their affiliates that work only in a state, and that say to treat the customers as their family. 
In a recent one passed, 15 of these banks went bankrupt. 
The latter days, Washington Mutual, a bank to the capital of 327$ did recourse to the bankruptcy syndic, and while the New Yorkais returned to the house for the week end this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, to the accounts saves of a value of 440$ million, looked for désespéramment a buyer to save it. 
The office and the store employees that are in front of me, frightened of another potentielle collapses, transferred their money to a bank that seems to them reliable, be the one that does the more of salvage to Wall Street. 
New Yorkais any became very familiar to the finance world the latter weeks. 
"I heard a lady to my Chinese local supermarket, to talk on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and of his lean general director Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity that she could have had for critical a colleague. 
And Lyn, the janitor in uniform of my building, changed the subject of our habitual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries of my merchant of fruit and vegetables. 
She said me, after my visit to the bank. "I put all my economies in the market of the monetary funds. 
"I changed, I do not want to take risk".

"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer 
Or heels, or clothing of étrenne. 
The gasoline of the big masters of flamenco, liberated of all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or woman. 
On one hand the artist. 
Other, the person. 
Inseparable except in the intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers to intimate gestures and stolen looks of the artists that do not be concerned climb on scene. 
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the théâtralité of some present with singers, dancers and guitarists with this side less known artists. 
In this project, the photographer resumes special iconography of the flamenco under different angles. 
Incluse in the programming of the Month of the Flemish Photograph, the exposition "reflects international importance of flamenco, bigger every day", explains the creator, that clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be does not import that but, after seeing the photos, the observer goes counts that this are typical pictures of artists on scene. 
These photographed persons "in the street" are artists able to transmit on passion scene, sadness, joy... while captivating the public. 
To capture instants of personality of these artists it is not necessary to do photos on scene. 
They have a personality and an own character. 
Which interested me it was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera of the instants of personality of the stars of flamenco ". 
With the festival "popular Song of the Expressions", Bauer began in 1997 a long trip to photograph the singers, the guitarists or the dancers with a camera to veneers. 
This are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and equipment, recollects the classical photograph. 
The implement of average different stylistiques breaks with the classical side of the picture, giving some to him a modernity key, this reflects the flamenco perception according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and that surprises every day". 
It is not a matter not of the dance or of the song in itself, but personality and character of the artist that captive the public with his art. 
The research of the essential one and magic was the constant one of this work that one presents these days to the gallery El Fotómata. 
The flamenco stars as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection done from about seventy photographed artists. 
The project transformed itself in a flamenco anthology, that soon will be published in a book of anthology of the exposed portraits to the gallery. 
The passion for the portraits of Bauer brought it to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsmen" ("SportARTproject"). 
Although the concepts be different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that it loves to photograph the people portrait, to know them and to be able to enter in their life for an instant more or less long. 
I believe that in the photograph the portrait is the kind more difficult. 
You are located opposite persons, of personages that sometimes you do not know or that leave you only some minutes to be able to do them a photo. 
Despite these circumstances, as photographer, I always try that my ideas become reality ". 
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco that entitles itself "Flamenco - people", is exposed to the Gallery El Fotómata, situated to the number 20 of the street of Curbed it (parallel street to the Poplar Grove of Hercules) that will be opened until October 16 next one.

While inspiring itself narratives of Benito Perisies Galdós, José Shines Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in" Sangre of mayo", that is the film more ambitious of his filmography with near of 15 million Euros of budget. 
The film director tried "to present the numerous personages and to illustrate the social analysis" that it always admired in the work of the famous novelist, it explained today during the film presentation, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors. 
The film of a length of more than two hours and half," Sangre of mayo" will do his exit in the rooms of movie Friday next, that will become next a televised series for Telemadrid of more than four hours. 
Big admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Shines Garci assures to have realized with this shooting "a dream of child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, that loaded it, three years ago, to shoot a film commemorative for the two hundred years of May 2 madrilène, thing that it always accepted when the narrative was anxious the national historic facts.

Isabelle Bayón puts itself in the skin of the dancer sévillane Tórtola Valencia 
A dancer sévillane will pay homage to a dancer equally sévillane. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, girl of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola To Fit with steel) and of a mother andalouse (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the neighborhood of Triana and that at the age of three years will go to live to London with his family. 
It was a dancer of free dance and specialist of the eastern dances. 
She had a fascinating life, pioneer of the liberation of the woman, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
She was buddhist and vegetarian and pled for the corset abolition that prevented the free movement of the women. 
The life of this woman that marked the dance history in Europe of l'entre-deux-guerres, fascinated Isabelle Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and this last one proposed me to interpret the dancer sévillane Tórtola Valencia and that appeared me unbelievable". 
According to the dancer, "we do not try to relate his life but to translate his manner to think. 
The titles of its dances did me to think about flamenco. 
Thus, "the butterfly dance" did me to think about a popular dance cubaine and "the snake dance" to certain tangos. 
His dance was sensual and they said me that my manner to dance was the same as hers ", she asserts. 
The present was done thanks to two remarkable contributions: the one of Miguel Poveda that will sing again Isabela in the one of its spectacles, as it had done to "The puerta abierta"; and the one of the professor Matilde Coral, that exceptionally well wanted to collaborate with the one that was his student. 
"Matilde transforms Tórtola in a personage mature. 
I am happy because she accepted playing a role in my work and that honors me ". 
The present was done equally thanks to the musical composition and to the guitars of Jesús Torres there Paco Arriaga, to the folk song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga there Me of Morón; to the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as to the violates Rafa El Violated and to the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "that plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind Divas". 
This work relates also, in a way, the life of this woman that exposed itself in so distant places, especially for the era, as in India, to the United States, or in Russia, but equally in all Europe, since she habitually lived to London. 
"I wanted to recollect it because I think that this are these women that have a huge influence in their era and now no one knows and puts in value his work", asserts Bayón. 
The spectacle will begin to 20h30 to the theater Lope of Vega 
The publication of the "Newspaper of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennat 
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Newspaper of a recently married Poet" in the Holy church Stephen's to New York, place where Juan Ramón Jiménez got married with Zenobia in March 1916, is in line with itself the activity framework foreseen by the Ministry of the Culture of the Andalousia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to commemorate the fiftieth birthday of the Literature and their deaths. 
Of this manner, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" arrives to his end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place at New York, with the restoration of the Museum Nobel and with the traveling exposition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This light poplar" that was inaugurated in the month of last May and that, after traveling in the different provinces andalouses, will go to New York at the time of the International Congress.

America pleases less without Paul Newman 
"Sometimes God creates perfect persons 
Paul Newman did some left". 
This sentence is actress Sally Field, that worked with him in "malice Absence", and illustrates well the despair of the American movie, and of all America, facing the idea striking that Newman no longer is of this world. 
It had trouble to obtain an Oscar 
It no longer turned since 2007. 
Everyone knew that it was sick. 
That was a hard blow for everyone. 
"Sometimes which the one feels surpasses all expression, and now I lost a big friend", cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to his existence". 
No one was afraid of to go ridiculous or to exaggerate. 
One of the fathers of the movie and fatherland is dead during a particularly obscure period, where the terrorists and the stock market markets scare, the esteem of the Americans fell well low, while looking for desperately motives of dignity. 
When the times are so hard and without reason to live, it does not remain at the human beings that admiration and it is not necessary to be Shines Cernuda to like Paul Newman. 
It embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and of truth. 
It was the enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of it the lost and overcome causes, as the foundation for the antidrug created fight in honor of his deceased oldest child after an overdose and the creation of his clean brand of food bio. 
This was a victory for a country that had trouble to impose against a suicidal food culture. 
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without watching out or to the nationalities or to the passports. 
The last James Leap, the English Daniel Craig, noted that no James Leap is dead before him. 
An English other, the oscarisé Sam Mendes, said that to work with Newman marked the summit of his career. 
The bad arrived boy of Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his bigger inspiration. 
"It placed us the high bar", noted George Clooney, that is maybe the only one today that tries to pierce the screen as did it Paul Newman: while being very honnêt and in having a serious private life and far objectives. 
This is not not yet easy or possible in the media jungle these days. 
But it there the one that tries, and Paul Newman is an example. 
After a divorce, it was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to that it was faithful even if timeliness did not lack for him for not the being. 
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside at my place, if I have a beefsteak in my fridge?", was it used to joke. 
To the sky, it attends with pride to the encounter of its girls with its fans on earth, something that is not so habitual in America. 
"Among all the big roles that it interpreted, it never as proud as the one of the devoted husband, father in love, attentive grandfather and philanthropist", it say. 
Madrid in the race to the organization of the Olympic Games of 2016 
And yes, the dream by far of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, that could realize itself in 2016. 
But me I wonder if we are ready. 
If we take the example of the race of yesterday: we are not it! 
They call it the perfect race, but according to me it was the worse race to which I never participated. 
Themselves they had taken into account all the errors arising during the race, these would be the object of a grade éliminatoire. 
But let us examine all in detail and as early as the beginning. 
The errors begin with the number collection, that obliges you to there to go in advance. 
That is not poorly but themselves they do you to move would be better than they gives you all (including the microchip for the races). 
And well no 
They did you to go over there only to take number (first error, to move itself only for that) and (after a long line of expectation) surprised!, there was only the size 'ITSELF for the shirt (second error, because I need a size XL) 
Do in which world let us live we? 
Est-ce-t-il because of the crisis that they decided to buy that of the shirts of small size with less than and fabric suddenly less dear? 
Well, this is nothing in comparison with what happened the day of the races. 
To leaves the Fact that it is necessary there to go very early to withdraw the microchip, the expectation line is of 15 minutes and, of more, it is necessary to leave his backpack to the entry. 
The expectation lasted more than 35 minutes, that is incomprehensible being given that 11,000 persons are awaited for these races. 
Since there is had a long line of expectation, the competitions began and we again had not left our backpack to the entry, although once does, the collection was worse. 
Of more, rain accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which took place rebellions and assaults of the shack. 
I believe that about 500 persons will have pneumonia tomorrow, and certain persons as me, will not figure even in the classification with the exact time, because of the flea that they gave me that, I think, did not mark correctly the departure. 
Of course, themselves they asked me to quote an example of perfect race, this one would not come me especially to the idea. 
Thus I believe that we always will be able to dream to become the city host for the J.O. of 2016. 
Microsoft looks for a receptionist (potential) 
To the lecture on the Emerging Technologies of the PLACEMENT Microsoft was presented a new system of recognition of picture and of human interaction, a type of Artificial Intelligence endow with few intelligence but able to accomplish some basal tasks, as to call a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move itself in the business campus) in response to what one asked for him. 
Thanks to a movie camera and to a system of recognition of forms and of faces, this "receptionist" can know how many persons there is in the place, that they are - including to remember which posts they occupy - and listen and hear the words keys of their conversations. 
But equally to group together them according to groups of conversation 
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is speaking with her and that she does not do left the business. 
She asks for him if she is here to return visits to someone and she says for him that she will reply for him in some instants. 
All this without blue screen. 
Impressive. 
But of course that represents the future. 
Now the business has something else on which ones to concentrate, for example on the next version of his operational system, Windows. 
This week one spoke what's more of a change of strategy with Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and it no longer will have as much associated programs. 
Steve Ballmer discovered that if the computers were sold with the essential one instead of useless applications, they would go five times more quickly. 
That represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, did not stop add of the functions and of the "first rate" to Windows. 
The strategy change is the welcome. 
Microsoft has reason, his operational system loses importance but equally his software. 
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was the one of those that adhered to the theory according to which Google Chrome is the first gait from Google for done competition to Windows. 
Several persons underlined to just title that a navigator Internet is not an operational system. 
The operational system will always be necessary since this is the essential basis for that computer equipment and software understand themselves. 
It occupies the same function that your woman or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law. 
It is true. 
It never will disappear but it is necessary to see the "dead" not operational system as an absolute truth but as a relative truth. 
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea. 
The people do less and less attention to the operational system but more and more to the navigator Internet. 
One lights the computer only to let Firefox turn, Explore or Chrome and every day the past people more time to sail on Internet that to traverse windows. 
Do to that serve the half of the furnished applications with the system? 
Who can the more can the less. 
And Windows 7 will have to contain less than applications, a lot less than Vista. 
Less heavy, cluttered, less complex month. 
For the moment, Microsoft is very interested in the launch of its own services online for than they become at last an alternate one to Google. 
They have desperately need of that, in fact, and I show you an example. 
The photo presents in this item, was taken at first of this month in the one of the rooms of reserved rest to the employees of Microsoft to Redmond. 
On the drink distributor, a poster their request to use their own tool of research - "Your research. Our future". 
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of the employees of Microsoft used Google to look for the news on Internet. 
Last week a delay produced itself in the new version of Movable Windows 7. 
She do not go out at first of 2009 but towards the at the end of 2009 or see in 2010. 
Microsoft will try surely to launch to the same moment Windows 7 and Movable Windows 7. 
The telephone, after all, resemble more and more to a computer. 
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone already being on the market, that will cost them a lot. 
The Fabulous Marcel 
Pablo Picasso endorsed it on the Coast of Azure, said Leonardo Caprio carried one in the 'Diamond of blood' of Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'Godfather' of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the held association of the muscular gays. 
And if we begin enumerating all its apparitions, one could equally quote this sturdy one with a mustache one that raised weight in an itinerant circus. 
This is not that a simple shirt of masculine body in cotton, molding and sleeveless. 
The English the calls 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels distinguishes itself among all the others. 
First of all, by his name blazing - although it is known under the name of 'Marcel' - that has to see with the sport since it takes the name, according to the legend, boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Sparrow. 
The 'Marcel' distinguishes itself others by his excellent cotton, by his unisex cutting, by his distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (scarcely recognizable) that the body shirts the more known have in the neck. 
But attention, for the Belgian brand does not produce only that of the tanks tops. 
But she produces equally sweat-shirt, of the punch nostalgic style, cardigans in cashmere, pants in cotton, babies, of the mini-shorts.. 
Conceived clothes for the comfort of the under clothing. 
Even if it is damage to carry them only as under clothing. 
They have too much charm. 
"I want to become a young mom; the candidate does not worry me" 
His huge resemblance with his sister did not prevent for him to develop his own personality. 
Monica Cruz is small but a lot of vitality. 
Currently the sisters Cruz take very to the serious one their new activity in the method. 
According to Monica, they are not that of the beautiful and famous girls that lend their name. 
She was present to the promotion that the brand Mango did to Paris to his new social seat but as well as to the price presentation the most important ones of the method than the Spanish house sponsors.

A very excessive day but, at the same time, exciting, we awaits. 
Does on what base itself your new created collection for Mango for this fourth season? 
The year movie 50 and 60 delights us and we ourselves some let us inspire a lot for our collections. 
I like a lot to take around me in city and observe the women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothing, I do it often. 
Dancer, actress and designer, you are a very polyvalent woman: isn't that right? 
I believe that yes but in the last analysis all rejoins and these activities have a lot of things in common. 
Since that I am all small the clothing pleased me; I desired to go with my grandmother to look in the closets of my aunt and to see its clothing. 
It was inspired, almost better than to go to the attraction park. 
Next, when I became dancer, I always tried to take care of my manner to get dressed me. 
The dancers like a lot well to get dressed for the courses and the tests, to look in itself the mirror and to feel well. 
And in the role of actress, when you endorse the clothing this is at that very moment that you put yourself actually in the skin of the personage. 
Suddenly, all is secured. 
You had there is not a long time 30 years: that was it hard for you? 
Not at all. 
I feel better than never, my 30 years gladden me. 
I find that the woman is riper, has more experience and savors the life with less than problems. 
The biological clock does not do me fear. 
I did all the things that I wanted to do since all small one and that gave me a lot of internal happinesses. 
Then, think you to become mom? 
Of course, I want to become mom because my body wonders it for me and, of more, I want to become a young mom; I do not want to lose that. 
In the matter of the candidate, I do not worry. 
What I will do is to give a lot of happinesses to my son and to raise it with a lot of loves. 
Come in to the movies, you await that the different films that you turned last year go out. 
It is true, I am in a hurry that they go out. 
Me that am a woman coming from the theater, I am very irritates and worried, I would like all to have now but of course is possible. 
I am in a hurry that sort the films 'The última hora' and 'In busca of the tumba of Cristo'. 
To see what you will think some… 
Some days ago you began on the link with Naomi Campbell, isn't that right? 
Said not that! 
I did not bring up on the link to do the model. 
All simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I know it since not poorly of time, to invite me to participate in London to a charity parade for his association in support favor to the women and the clothing that we exposed - I exposed two clothing of our collection create for Mango - were sold to the bids to collect money for the NGO of Naomi. 
The people that Naomi is a person to the heart to stretch. 
They say so many things on her, me I know it, a lot of things are not true. 
Of more, this so good side of Naomi fascinates me. 
She asked me to march for a so noble cause, but if she had me to ask to do a headstand, I would have done it nonetheless. 
The important one this is to return life better to the women of the third world one. 
The repeat offenders of the alcohol to the flying one will have to install the system 'alcolock' 
The Minister of the Interior wants that the driver that had more than three administrative penalties for blood alcohol level, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents to start up the vehicle in condition to drunkenness, or if it does not blow. 
The initiative already was announced in the month of last June and she appears henceforth in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered as a project pilots that will last a year. 
His goal the rehabilitation of the driver proposing some for him courses of road re-education. 
The Minister of loaded State of the road security but equally the General Direction of the Road Security and Foundation Institute Technological for the automobile Security will participate in this initiative. 
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the stopped motorists for have driven more of once in condition to drunkenness, resumes the car. 
The alcolock would avoid that since this is a connected system on the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the breath and prevents to start up the vehicle if the driver does not blow before; or when the rate of alcohol of the driver is superior to the one authorized. 
His cost is superior to 1,000 Euros and is dependent upon the driver. 
In this respect, a conducted study to the United States in 2007 showed that the equipped vehicles of this device reduced until 65% of the offences during the first year of installation. 
And in Spain one considers that that could save the life to 115 persons each year. 
This measure is held some that to administrative penalties for two reasons: to do facing these behaviors before they do not transform themselves in penal offences. 
And facilitate his implement, since the lawful reformation can be done by ordinary ways but, nevertheless, the reformation done by penal ways demands a reformation of the organic law. 
The device is not again available on the Spanish market under no commercial, although certain form industrial vehicles and of function in already possesses one to experimental title. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of the Representatives will vote an initiative on the part Spanish socialist that proposes to install in the school buses this systems as that was done in France. 
To the Mexico without 'peep-toes' 
To 17h40 specifies, official foreseen hour, the aerial Spanish force airplane in which the Princes of the Asturies traveled landed in the presidential Shed of the airport Benito Juárez of Mexico DF. 
The sun was on the eve of to go to bed but its rays obliged again to put the hand by way of eyeshade to be able to see the royal couple descend of the airplane. 
To the stairway foot, the Spanish ambassador and of other authorities were present. 
Some hours beforehand I had asked in the street, to the taxi driver, if it knew that the Spanish Princes visited the city to finish their official trip. 
- Ah, very well, suddenly one will not be able to go to the airport to take customers to this hour... Are you of here or then…? 
- No, non-mister, I am Spanish but I lived here thinking two years. 
- Ah, very well… 
But the Mexican press knows very well that are the Princes of the Asturies and knows trip importance. 
They are several to await in the airport shed close to the red rug and to a military row composite of 27 soldiers of navy. 
The Prince is smiling and dressed of navy blue, the Princess, when to her, has the hair to the wind, is dressed very temperately and does not carry its 'peep-toes' habitual; maybe that they had said for him that a storm threatened. 
They do a brief stop with the photographers before passing in the room where the official procession awaits them. 
To the hotel door where they lodge, the one of the four bigger hotels of the city, a comic journalist of the Mexican television awaits them. 
The price more prestigious of the method 
It there has not surely any more fitting place in the world to present a method price than Paris and it does not exist surely any living designer extraordinarier and better screw than Valentino. 
Mango has just presented the second edition of the botón-mango Fashion Awards, in order to reinforce the international picture of the new talents of the method. 
The conqueror will be rewarded by a price of 300,000 Euros. 
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian gone out conqueror of the first edition, looked at its models in the window of Mango to the 54 boulevards Haussmann to Paris and she cried some almost emotion. 
Of course this is the second one bigger store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface. 
The first shop is located to London. 
The events, as well as the desire to thank the styliste Valentino, jury foreman of the competition, did that we met again in a luxurious dinner to the opera Garnier of Paris. 
With as table neighbors the one of the extraordinary family Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango, appeared even more spectacular. 
In having big on the heart and while doing against bad good fortune heart, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati put itself a clothing of Mango and some costumes of ELAH, that cut the breath, and arm over, arm under with his son Shines - a beautiful man of almost two meters of top – she accompanied Valentino to his prepared dinner in his honor. 
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron of Rotchil finished the evening without jacket because they had lent them to two ladies. 
Monica Cruz, that presented itself to the store with a pants and a shirt – of his own collection - and that for the dinner is metamorphosed itself while endorsing a long dress sexy and black, moved itself when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of the repetitions of the ballets and while reminding of the old voucher time, she And she did the gesture of a 'big folded'. 
Inés Sastre did not remain for the visit of the dependances of the palace, but she showed us before on his portable telephone of the photos of his son. 
In the morning following, we had the pleasure to see Olive Tree Martínez – a beautiful other man that moves itself in bike - and John Travolta, that arrived to the intercontinental hotel of Paris, with its sheet, its briefcases and while having asked the previous one, that there be not odors in his room. 
Stars under the sky étoilé of Paris. 
Oh there there, this is life. 
1001, the number antistress 
There is not that 1000 but 1001 manners to forget the chaos and the frenzy of daily life. 
And to crown the all, they all are indexed in a book that will bring discharge to the booksellers September 30. 
The awakens morning saddens us almost when it rings every morning at 7 o'clock, but it is worse again when one thinks about the restless rhythm than we impose current life. 
The office is synonymous with tension and the pain computer to the back. 
The anxiety represents the evil of the XXIème century. 
But it does not exist or an or two methods to fight the daily fatigue and the problems linked to the working world. 
But well 1001, or one of more or one of less. 
To leaves the yoga positions, the classical massage or the treatments 'spa', Susannah Marriott meets in the pages of a book all a 'menu' of adapted methods to the taste and to the time of each. 
The work antistress entitles itself '1001 manners to relax' and will arrive with the booksellers directly of the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain from the quietness in places as the work or through personal relations, this 'manual' denies such a belief. 
Of more, this manual offers other methods as the contact with the nature or recipes 100% natural ones that help to relax you. 
If the adrenaline does not run in your veins to restore the balance of your body and if the anxiety became a problem, it is time to sit in the couch, to disconnect from his spirit and to concentrate on the reading. 
Speak while sleeping 
Some children speak during the night. 
I do not retrieve myself to those that awaken very awakened while relating us something that happened the day before, but to the children that speak during their sleep. 
The first time that that arrives that can surprise you, but in reality that has not any importance. 
This is a benign deterioration of the sleep that is called somniloquie. 
This is rather frequent, especially with the children and with the adolescent ones. 
It is sure that there are some more of a that speaks during the night. 
This phenomenon can appear in a manner very sporadic (once in life for example associated to an episode of strong fever), or in a manner more periodic (everyday, once a week, once a month ...), the day according to the child does not remember more anything. 
It does not exist any unique cause that determines his apparition 
They often are linked to other deteriorations of the sleep as the nightmares, the night terrors, the night énurésies (done pipi to the bed) or the somnambulisme, but this always is not the case. 
As we already said it before, they also can be associated with of very strong fevers, to positions of anxiety or of surexcitation. 
In any case this is a phenomenon not very studied. 
The intensity with which it produces himself is equally very variable. 
It can himself that it speaks with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, murmurs or on the contrary with cries, pleurs, long speeches... 
If the somniloquie becomes very frequents, it would be wise to observe the child and to consult a specialist, to verify if there is a problem that provokes a lot of anxieties and in order to obtain an explanation to this problem. 
We said that this is a benign deterioration, this is the reason why there is not treatment, except if this is linked to another deterioration of the sleep that can be cared for (for example, if this is linked to an apnea of sleep or to anxiety). 
What one can do is to take into account a number of preventive very simple measures such as: 
Try of not to excite the child before to be going to sleep. 
Consequently to look for quiet games and avoid programs or televised series that be more or less violent. 
With very nervous children and that have trouble to relax, techniques of relaxation can be used to help them to calm itself internally. 
That will allow the child to have a calmer sleep. 
As soon as the somniloquies appear try to remain calm. 
Recall you that they are inoffensive for the child and that the next day it will not remember more of what happened. 
Useful counsels 
Do not awaken it. 
It is useless since it is unconscious and you the réveilleriez. 
Even if it speaks, it sleeps and rests therefore. 
Recall you that if it shows himself very worried several times, it is counseled to consult a doctor or to verify what provokes so many anxiety with the child. 
If you understand what it says (which is not habitual), have not the temptation to question it to obtain from the news. 
You will obtain nothing, because while sleeping, it is not conscious to be able to organize his thought. 
Of more, you will hear what it says, but you will not know to what it is dreaming, suddenly pay attention to the manner to which will interpret you information and to the conclusions that you draw from it. 
Never say to the child that you can question it during the night to know its secrets. 
Even not while joking. 
That provokes a lot of anxieties. 
In conclusion, do not worry you, that is nothing of well mean one, this is an episode that lasts only some minutes. 
Illhaeusern... at last 
Illhaeusern at last rediscovered the victory way on his land after a long period of famine. 
Without doing a big game, the Yellow and Black ones created themselves the biggest number of occasions and succeeded in some to transform a for the game gain. 
The rhythm very was not supported during this encounter where the attacks had trouble to express itself. 
After a first attempt of the captain visitor Kauffmann that brushed the skylight on a shooting by far, Illhaeusern was going to take lightly the rising and turn to turn Fonderflick by far, then with Hirn above, Roman of the end of the foot or again Diebold came to tickle the defense of Dannemarie. 
Straight out, one did pad in the middle of land and one left just stirring it Riahi to the attack point. 
The beginning of part-time second was going to be decisive with first two signed occasions Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and right after the score opening for the Illhousiens by Marsh, well positioned to resume a pushed back bullet on a first attempt of Diebold (53rd'). 
But the kicker Illhousiens will not be able to savor his happiness a long time and will be obliged to regain the vestiaires a dozen minutes later and leave thus its teammates in numerical inferiority. 
But Dannemarie will not know to profit from it and will not put any big problems to an Eleven illhousien that has just backed up a little for "compacter" his defense, except in the all last seconds of game where, after a big bungling, the bullet passed very close to the transverse one.

Close to two republicans on three rejected his plan. 
"This is a bad sharp signal to the market, that sees the incapable Congress to adopt a plan", estimated Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial. 
"That shows to which not at all the market counted on this plan", she added, fearing that an adopted project in several days does not arrive "too late". 
"If the project is effectively dying (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the American central bank, editor's note) and to the other central banks to manage the crisis, which would tighten more the conditions of credit", warned Brian Bethune, boss economist to Global Insight.

Obama, conqueror to the points of the first televised duel 
To the first debate of Friday between the two candidates to the White House succeeded another to know that, of John McCain or Barack Obama, took it. 
Without surprised, the QG of republican country and democrat proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that would have been followed by a third of the American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen considers that the benefit of John McCain, although honorable, was not enough "brilliant" for him to allow stopping his decrease in the polls to five weeks of the presidential ones. 
The institute Gallup, of which an investigation of published opinion Saturday grants an advance of five points to Obama (49% against 44% to McCain), judges that this is the democrat that pulled his game pin. 
With the undecided voters, that are those that count, Obama took out conqueror for 39% of the probes, while 25% of them grant the victory to McCain, according to a poll CBS. 
Obama should be able to confirm his advance Thursday with the good benefit awaited of his running mate, Joseph Biden, at the time of the first one and unique public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin. 
"This would be an error of the under to estimate. 
She is has good instincts", nevertheless warned Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The seventy-year-old McCain had not of stop putting forward his indisputable experience in the matter of foreign political, all while underlining the "innocence" of his opponent on these questions that were at the heart of this first face-to-face. 
"The senator Obama does not seem to understand that. ..” it accused has several returns. 
"I do not believe that the senator Obama have the experience and to know it necessary to be president", it also assured. 
An angle of hammered attack since yesterday in republican televised advertisings. 
Obama has, him, underlined that it represented the future. 
Without dismantling itself, it showed himself concise and precise. 
It put forward his capacity to take the good decisions, and to restore the picture of the United States in the world. 
"McCain did not not yet understand, while Obama, if", retorted, this weekend, a spore democrat accusing the republican of not to have taken the whole measure of the impact of the crisis on the" American of the street". 
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say on me, but nothing on you, denounced Obama, yesterday, in front of 20 000 personnesrassemblées for an electoral meeting in Caroline of the North under a rain beating. 
It did not even pronounce the words "average class" or "workers"." The financial rout advantage clearly Obama, that is considered by the Americans as the more to even to save the economy by the precipice. 
"The week to come could be a decisive turn", estimated, yesterday, the influential senator democrat Charles Schumer. 
The representative democrat Rahm Emanuel, an old one of the administration Clinton, compared the "good economical instincts" of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
For the candidate democrat, the current débacle "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad political one economical implement by George Bush and sustained by the senator McCain". 
Reaffirming that it would reach nonetheless to reduce the taxes of 95% of the Americans despite the soubresauts of Wall Street, the senator of the Illinois also signaled as the realization of an eventual energetic independence of the country by the promotion of the renewable energies was his first priority, with set it up of a system of health insurance. 
McCain, him, wished to construct a park of 45 central nuclear power of here to 2030. 
Prudent, the two candidates eluded the questions carrying from the viewpoint of financial salvage of 700 billion dollars (470 billion Euros) adopted last night by the Congress and extremely unpopular. 
To Minsk, "you noticed that there was an election, you?"

They do not believe that the system that did good figure in the foreign observers with the intention of to resume language with the European Union be ready to carry out a democratic turn. 
Penalties, of which the ban of aim for 40 byelorussian leaders and the freeze of some have, could be got up if these elections were considered as clean by the observers. 
They were not it according to the opposition. 
"We were stood to the side electoral commissions and our observers were not able to participate in counting of votes", deplored Iouri Potemkine, the Spokesperson of the Union of the democratic Forces, a heterogenous grouping of twelve parties. 
"This is a cosmetic change, underlines Alexander Milinkievitch, former candidate of the opposition to the presidential one of 2006 and leader of the movement proeuropéen, for the important one this is that counts voices, and at our place, this is the executive strength. 
If representatives of the opposition enter to the parliament, this is that they will have been named, done not elect. 
But their entry to the parliament can mean space to the television, meetings in the regions and suggestions of laws." 
The opposition has itself therefore to enter into the political game for "it is necessary to start the dialog with the European Union. 
For if our economy, that heavily is gotten in debt with respect to Russia, enters in crisis, and that we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorat of Russia. 
Now we want to be independent". 
The opposition fears that the Organization for the security and the cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the ballot validité. 
She underlines that the participation figures appear too students, and that the vote generalization by anticipation (26% of the voters to Minsk) opened the voice to all the manipulations. 
"You noticed that there was an election, you? questions the social leader democrat Alexander Kozouline, one of the two last political prisoners liberated in August of this year. 
It had not anybody in the polling stations. 
And there will be at the maximum five representatives of the opposition to the parliament, those that suit the better in power one." 
The night silence falls again on the place of October. 
To the television, the president Loukachenko and the central electoral commission members congratulate themselves for their success. 
The interview - sure returned to normalcy blood 
Héma-québec celebrated yesterday the 10th birthday of his foundation, and his president, the Dre Francine Décary, was justified in to gladden itself, for héma-québec became the one of the suppliers of blood more security and effective of the world. 
And especially, it recovered public confidence that seriously had been shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the years 1980 and 1990. 
As one knows it, the national reserves of blood managed by the Service of transfusion of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated by the virus of the obtained immunodeficiency (VIH) and the virus of the hepatitis C during the years 1980. 
In front of this drama and grumbles it public, the government of Canada instituted in February 1994 a public investigation, presided by the judge Horace Krever, investigates that aimed to do the light on the circumstances having driven to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations for that such a disaster does not reproduce itself more. 
While the judge Krever delayed depositing his report, certain provinces then set up a committee having for objective to plan a new system of management of the blood to Canada. 
To the Quebec, the committee Gélineau filled this mandate. 
Following the reports Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers were created to Canada: Héma-québec to serve the Quebec and the Canadian Corporation of the blood to supply all the other provinces and the two territories. 
"In 1998, when héma-québec began its activities, scarcely 38% of the people had again confidence in the blood system to the Quebec, remembers the Dre Décary. 
The position was discouraging. 
To forces efforts to improve the security of the sanguine products and of work in the field during the years that followed, we regained public confidence", she says before asserting proudly that at first of 2008, close to 94% of the Quebec population had henceforth confidence in héma-québec. 
The Dre Décary keeps nevertheless in head that "confidence is something of extremely fragile one". 
As early as his creation, September 28 1998, héma-québec applied the precaution principle. 
To this era, one attended in Europe to the éclosion many cases of the human form of the mad cow disease, a new variant of the disease of creutzfeldt-jakob, relates the one that holds the fort since his foundation in 1998. 
"And we not at all knew if this disease could transmit itself by the blood. 
One then leaned on one of the principal recommendations of the reports Krever and Gélineau, according to which when one does not know it and that a serious disease can to result about it, in this case the creutzfeldt-jakob disease that characterizes itself by a brain dégénérescence inevitably taking to the death, one establishes measures of exclusion. 
In April 1999, one has therefore refused the blood of the persons that had stayed more of a month to the United Kingdom since 1980. 
Now, some years ago, it was shown outside all doubt that this disease transmits itself by the blood. 
This episode thus showed us that the precaution principle that one applied had direction." 
In 1999 appeared on the market a technique a lot more sensitive one of screening of the VIH: the tests of acid nucléique (TAN) that allow detecting directly in the giver blood the virus presence himself and not the one of antibody against the virus, on which these rested the used tests even then. 
The TAN allowed shortening the mute period, that spreads itself between the moment where the person was infected and the one where the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist. 
One was able to reduce this period to an inferior length to a week. 
One thus diminished substantially risks it that certain givers are infected without knowing it and that one cannot detect them. 
These improvements allowed lowering considerably risks it to contract the Aids by a sanguine transfusion. 
Today, a person on 12 million current the risk to receive blood contaminated by the VIH. 
"In of other words, that wants to say that it will be necessary to distribute 12 millions of sanguine products before someone is infected by the VIH. 
As héma-québec distributes each year between 400 000 and 500 000 sanguine products, that will take more than 24 years before does not arise a case of transmission of the VIH by a sanguine product. 
I believe that one today can feel comfortable to receive or to prescribe a sanguine transfusion to recover health", asserts the boss of the direction of héma-québec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the security of our products. 
One never knows pathogenic which will emerge in the system. 
Not later than the past year appeared on the island of the Meeting the virus Chikungunya that, following the example of the virus of the western Nil, is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant", follows the Dre Décary before underlining that what's more of a security supplying, héma-québec also must foresee a sufficient supplying. 
"The needs increase because the population ages. 
The cancer treatments being more aggressive, the patients have often need of one refills in red globules or in small plates. 
The population ageing has also consequences on the network of the givers of blood that does not group together in average as 3% of the Quebec admissible one to the blood gift." 
All person in health, 18 years old and more replying to the acceptability criteria nevertheless can give blood all the 56 days, be six times by year. 
In average, 14% of the persons that propose their blood are not accepted, because they are suffering from the Aids or malaria, for example, and if they traveled in a country where holds sway the malaria, they will be excluded for a period of a year. 
"With these 3%, we arrive to maintain an inventory that replies to the hospital needs. 
The scarcities are very rare. 
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of givers as they age and not more can give of their blood. 
Now it is difficult to convince the people to give of their blood, but especially to keep them and to incite them to become uniform giver. 
The life of today being so frantic, one finds rarely the time to spend an hour to give of his blood", grieves itself Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of 297 millions of dollars, héma-québec furnishes not only sanguine products, but also human fabrics, of which of the graft bony, cardiac valves, globes eyepieces and skin that almost exclusively is used for the big ones burned. 
These fabrics are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored with héma-québec that manages also the only public bank of blood of cord to the Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that formerly was considered as a biomedical loss is crammed of a rich blood in stem cells being able to serve to treat diseases engrave, such as the leukaemia. 
"One celebrated, some weeks ago, the placement in bank of our thousandth sample of blood of cord and one foresees to remove about it more than thousand by year. 
One should begin to some to propose for transplants at first of next year", precise the Dre Décary that describes this program of sampling of blood of cord as very popular. 
"Several moms are disappointed of not there to be able to have access", for héma-québec has the means to propose this complex and costly program in all the hospitals of the Quebec. 
Soccer - THE Impact in semifinal

"I am not again ready, warned the Russian. 
It is necessary for me another game to feel me comfortable."

It had a beautiful ovation." 
Put Charest on the North 
The Prime Minister does not exclude to release elections before the year end 
Sitôt the general counsel of the liberal finished Party, John Charest went yesterday in John Heel, to Quebec, where the new minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (to the left), stretched to do itself to elect to the occasion of the partial election of today. 
"To push back the limits of our big last north border" : such is ambition in the long term that John Charest presented with visual force all while remaining in the big lines, at the end of the general counsel of the liberal Party of the Quebec, to Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a sort of Mill to pictures. 
Turned in buckle, on three immense screens, spectacular clichés of hydroelectric barriers, of mining exploitation, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", cards, etc. 
Big means as in electoral period. 
In press conference, besides, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that it would release the elections this fall, even if it pointed out that his schedule was very loaded. 
The "Plan North" is the fourth section of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for the Quebec, the one of a "new economical space", which understands an understanding on the manpower with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and understandings with the Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - never had been the object of a presentation. 
The Prime Minister nevertheless limited himself to explain why the North was "a jewel to the potential immense one", but did not give maturity date, of amounts of investment, or of priority specifies in the projects to come. 
All to the more some avenues of what could be developed more: notably hydroelectricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, doped by the growth of the emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, now, money, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to the enumeration of Mr. Charest. 
This "territory two big times as France", "this is at our place, this is at the Quebec. 
Not only this is at our place, but this is in we", it insisted, as for well to show that it solicited a national founding myth. 
The Quebec a lot constructed itself in his relation with the North, it underlined: kicked it towards the gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, the Bay James. 
"This is at us, this is our future", it added, after doing a theatrical pause contemplating the immense card behind him. 
The North, 70% of the Quebec territory, understands a portion of the Labrador that the Quebec always claimed, specified the Prime Minister at the time of the press conference. 
"This is a traditional position that all the governments reiterated. 
There is a border line on which there is not understanding since very a long time and, when the occasion presents itself, I reiterate that position in the name of the government", it indicated. 
To the remainder, "with the climatic changes, it is necessary to rethink our vision of the North", it declared while talking about the northwest passage, that will open all the year because of the ice bottom. 
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that to occupy the territory is a duty. 
And do live them territory, the First Nations and the Inuits? 
The Prime Minister said that the government of the Quebec would be very attentive to their consideration and that the project would take them advantage, notably to the young ones. 
Two former ministers originating of two different parties, Rock Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former representative péquiste of Ungava), already started consultations with about thirty communities. 
An interdepartmental committee presided by Sanctimonious Furrier and in which Julie Weight (Transportation and natural Resources) has an important place started works. 
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big encounter, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment where "one will give oneself a common vision". 
The development of the North would be done besides in accordance with the principles of the sustainable development. 
The Plan North will be "collective, ordered and respectful of the environment", it promised. 
John Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with the one of liberal Prime Minister that preceded it. 
"As the liberals that preceded us, we thought otherwise to transform the challenges in new occasions of growth and of development." 
That has besides summer one of the recurrent themes of the weekend, that started itself Friday by a big cocktail to underline the 50th birthday of the arrival of John Lesage at the head of the party. 
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rechristen the Central Beauharnois in Barrier adélard-godbout. 
"Of Godbout, that created hydro-québec, to Lesage that did the quiet Revolution and the hydroelectricity nationalization, to Bourassa that did the Bay James, our party knew to forge the future", declared John Charest. 
In press conference, it invoked another reference, conservative that one, the program "Roads à the North" of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1957 to 1963. 
While approaching the project of barrier hydro-électrique d'Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest underlined that his placement in service was foreseen for 2012. 
"That remains between we there, but I foresee there to be", it entrusted to its militant ones, giving rise to at their place applause nourish. 
In fact, the Prime Minister, that said in April that there would be not election in 2008 and doubtless not in 2009, did not separate the possibility to release a ballot this fall, which the law allows for him. 
It underlines that his schedule nevertheless is filled, notably by a mission of the counsel of the federation in China and a summit Quebec New York. 
The general Counsel of the weekend furnished to the liberal boss a plateforme containing nationalist resolutions, notably of the "constitutional aspirations" that are passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ claims in particular the recognition it "specificity of the Quebec" in the Constitution. 
It wishes also as the Quebec names members of the Counsel of the broadcasting and Canadian telecommunications and as the latter have a veto power on the taken decisions to the Quebec. 
Side of the opposition, one welcomed the big lines of the Plan North with skepticism. 
The boss péquiste, Pauline Marois, has gone out again politics of development of the Nord-du-Québec that the government Landry had launched in 2001. 
According to her, the liberal government, while arriving in power in 2003, renounced to apply it. 
If it had done it, "one more would be advanced today" commented on Mrs Marois alongside his candidate in John Heel (ballot that takes place today), Françoise Mercury. 
The ADQ said to support the adoption of a Plan North by the government. 
"But what one wishes is that that be not just a spectacle", commented on the leader Sébastien Proulx, in replacement of Mario Dumont, that returns from vacation today. 
Letters - A country disgraced 
This is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of the "Justice" (o irony) in the office Harper, that allowed itself the last summer to say Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada. 
Throw thus the opprobre on this woman that took a continuous fight for justice and that deserves all our admiration says some so long on the entourage of the Prime Minister as on Stephen Harper himself. 
We here in front of a government that is the only one, among all the western implied countries, to not to have repatriated his confined national in the camp of concentration of Guantánamo. 
A government that does not hold not in the least counts on account of the fact that Omar Khadr was an all adolescent young one at the facts that are reproached for him. 
The only government that, in vexation on account of the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, reemerged his word and leaves to rot in inhuman conditions a child soldier. 
The only one that relies on a justice parody to evaluate the guilt of the accused. 
Recall, for memory, that the UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of the Canadian Bar, notably, plead for the rapatriement of Omar Khadr so that it benefits from an equitable process to Canada. 
This is this same government that closes the eyes on the torture: little imports for him that a young adult henceforth psychologically is destroyed, doubtless forever after so many years of exactions. 
One not some returns again counts, but we attend in this moment to an insidious erosion of our rights, of our liberty and of our "democracy", this word that Harper does not stop brandishing and that rings so hollow in his mouth. 
Here come the time where no moral exists more: one can manhandle, torture, imprison arbitrarily a Canadian citizen according to the voucher to want of a so far minority head of state (that in it will be therefore after October 14. ..). 
Number of voters believe that they will find the good day in a party that advocates the Virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government renounced what did the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
Shame, Mr. Toews, she is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere. 
Free opinion - The speech orwellien of Barrick Gold 
In his edition of September 17, The To Must published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, guiding vice president of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold. 
Following a logical orwellienne, this one asserts that the biggest company gold stock of the world filed a pursuit in slander of six million against three authors and a small house of edition without the penny with the intention of to launch a "transparent public debate". 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, this is not the truth that they judge, especially in the pursuit case in slander, but the law. 
Without surprised, this basic difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver. 
For, for Barrick Gold, the better manner to take a public debate would she be to take to the ruin whoever dares to support an in contrast to position hers? 
Little imports the coming from the process, the authors and the editor of the Black book Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, to very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers sustained by the pockets almost without melts mining one. 
The tactics, in these unequal fights, is besides often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a regulation to the by private agreement one that will gag the opposition what's more to frighten whoever will dare to lean itself again on the question. 
If Barrick Gold wanted really a public debate, this is in front of the public opinion that she should have presented his fact vision. 
In contrast to what is done in several of the countries where works Barrick Gold, the debate to Canada do themselves normally by the exchange of ideas and not to baton blows. 
It sufficed therefore to the mining one to open its books, its files and to establish a true debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of teams of independent research that could have done the light on the question. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to have confidence in the public opinion and rejects back of the hand the petitions and support letters to the authors of Black Canada. 
Could maybe Mr. Garver explain how it can at once to ask a debate "public" all while despising the opinions of this same public? 
In the world of the vice president, it seems that this word designates only the fatty paid and not lawyers the body of the Canadians; here a rather narrow view of the concept. 
In democracy, even the detractors have straight to the word. 
Which does not understand - or does not want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Black Canada does it before all because it rejects the brutal manner of the mining one. 
This public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the framework of what several perceive as a pursuit gag (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold comes besides to deposit a formally notify to the place of the authors of Black Canada giving for them to stop the usage of this term. ..). 
Beyond the speech surréel of Mr. Garver, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the liberty of university research and the truth quest, essential to all democratic corporation. 
She been born, in pad, the right to the quotation of credible sources and to the debate on the facts and the interpretations, that represent the basis even of the work intellectual. 
If it is impossible student and to discuss subjects that déplaisent to the rich businesses of this world in a country as Canada, under penalty of pursuits to repetition, that will be able to do it? 
If Barrick Gold wanted really a public and transparent debate, she could do it in following the scientific norms used by the authors of Black Canada. 
She has a right of retorts. 
The university environment, to which one let us belong us, knows since a long time to manage the debate and the disagreements and resolve the conflicts. 
The excessive pursuit of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, in contrast to what she claims, she has no craving of a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the university world, just as for the public debate to Canada, and it is time that the governments set device up limiting this kind of improper pursuits. 
Operation of salvage of Wall Street - Democrats and republican agree 
The administration Bush and the leaders of the Congress, at once republican and democrats, finally arrived to an agreement yesterday on the biggest plan of economical salvage since the Big Depression of the years 30. 
The new version of the plan of 700 billion dollars American aiming to brake the financial crisis that shakes Wall Street since months again must be ratified by the two rooms of the Congress. 
She foresees notably: a better check by the elected officials of his placement in application, again mechanisms aiming to assure the reimbursement of public money engaged, of new disposals to contain the number of seized houses for payment defect, as well as a look right on the versed salaries to the leaders of the helped businesses. 
The American secretary to the Treasure, Henry Paulson, the president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and representing it republican to the negotiation table, the senator Judd Gregg, announced the good new one some minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations of two days. 
"We realized big progress regarding an understanding that will be effective on the markets", declared the representative of the administration Bush, Henry Paulson. 
"All was done so as to put under cover the real economy and the ordinary Americans of the crisis in course to Wall Street", explained the democrat. 
"This is the basic point: if we do not do that, traumatism, the chaos and the disruptions on daily life of the Americans will be immense", declared the republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had turned to the sprint in the last hours for fear of the effect that would provoke a new failure on the mood of the investors. 
The hour limit that one had agreed was the market opening this morning. 
Associated lately to the negotiations, the two candidates to the American presidential election showed themselves rather in favor of the understanding, without lacking nevertheless to express their discontent that one is obliged of some to arrive to this extremity. 
The senator democrat Barack Obama attributed itself the addition of certain disposals to the understanding, notably the one aiming to allow the owners to preserve their residence and the one on the salary of the leaders of the businesses surviving by the State. 
"When one asks the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain, it one is nothing to congratulate itself. 
But these measures are necessary", it commented on on the waves of the American television. 
Questioned on another chain to know if it would vote for the proposed plan, his republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope that yes." 
"The big lines that I read [show] that this is something that we all will have to digest and with which will be able to advance us. 
The option of not anything to do is all simply acceptable step", it said. 
The plan of 700 billions aims to repurchase with the money of the taxpayers the doubtful, active credits to risk and institution financial American invendables. 
It arrives after 14 months of a crisis released by the explosion of a real estate bubble that has first conducted to the collapse of the credits hypothécaires to risks (subprimes) before to spread itself to others form more shed titles of credit (PCAA) and of lead to a freeze of liquidities and on the disarray of the banks and financial institutions. 
This is a group of republican elected officials that had done to collapse the first project of understanding, last week. 
One believes to have gone out of this dead end since that the democrats accepted that certain active "toxic" companies in difficulty only are assured by the government, rather than bought. 
In order round off the angles for everyone to the Congress, one also added a disposal stipulating as if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could set up of new taxes aiming to help it to recover his placement. 
The new plan foresees the payment of a first slice of 250 billions to which will be able to add 100 other billions if the president judges it necessary. 
The payment of 350 other billions should be ratified by another votes Congress. 
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will obtain from the participations in the helped businesses that will be worth for him dividends in case of profit and that it will be able to sell when the tempest will be passed. 
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the seizure procedures concerning the attached lodgings to the ready real estate one concerned by this plan, as well as to set up limits to remuneration and to the compensation of versed departures to the leaders of the touched businesses. 
The plan architects would want to see it subjected to the vote of the House of Representatives as early as today, and to the one of the Senate Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is not again certain that their plan will have the green light. 
Voices in fact continued to rise yesterday against this project, so in the republican camp that democrat. 
"Quite obviously, Washington does not hear you", declared to the address of its voters the republican Scott Garrett, member of the commission of the finances of the Room. 
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not the one that consist in to take advantage of the taxpayers". 
Coordinator of a small group to the nicknamed Congress "the caucus of the skeptical ones", the representative democrat Brad Sherman presents the things otherwise, but arrives to the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred eminent professors of economy, of which three Prices Nobel, we wrote to say ourselves: one asks the Congress of not to press itself and to examine attentively the way to take", it declared yesterday. 
To the same moment, in Europe, one had a new time the proof of the world-wide nature of the crisis. 
At the end of an urgency meeting, the three countries of the Benelux announced the partial nationalization of the bank group Fortis for 11.2 billion Euros (16,3 billions US). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg had been rendered necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas made known that she renounced to obtain his competitor in the middle of the shipwreck since that she lost 2 billion Euros (2,9 billions US) in the crisis of the ready real estate one to risks to the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 persons and is part of the twenty bigger European banks and of the ten bigger underwriters. 
"This is not lost money, declared yesterday the Dutch minister of the Finances, Wouter Boron. 
In exchange, one recovers a vote right in the bank and influence. 
This is exactly something that the savings and the households appreciate now that the times announce themselves uncertain." 
During this time, on the other side Sleeve, the British government seemed in the process of to nationalize another bank manhandled by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would resume to his account the body of the ready ones in course with the bank Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billions (75,5 billions US) of real estate ready. 
The Spanish bank Santander made known yesterday that this is she that would buy the succursales and the accounts customers of the British bank. 
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Rock Northern, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Dead of an engaged icon 
His beauty to the azure eyes was a long time his card trump, of no will say his weakness. 
Was it liberated itself narcissistic mirror, the American actor to the charming mouse? 
Yes and no. 
His modesty, his sensitiveness and a talent that flowed source will equally have moved away it from the register of power that gives birth the true sacred monsters. 
But big which bottom racer! 
Paul Newman, disappeared Friday, to 83 years, continuations of a cancer of the lung in his ranch of the Connecticut, remain one of the last icons of the American movie of the years annalses. 
Less monumental than Brando, to that it resembled and of which it was a long time a sort of rival to the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but apostle equally of liberty and explosion of the dramatic conventions. 
The mixed blood do often of the magnificent children. 
It was born in Ohio in 1925, of a German Jewish father and of a Hungarian mother of origin. 
Of these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without excessive, ultimate ego brand of quality. 
For in him projected itself all an infatuated country of the coil made man, fighter of the war of the Pacific, injured in battle, that at first of the years 50 student the dramatic art to Yale then frequented the Actor's Studio of New York, before prevailing to the theater, to the television, soon to the movies. 
This same man that campaigned for the civic rights was also pilots it automobile that classified itself second to the 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, doubled of a sex symbol, although member of a couple models formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
Disappear also with him the zones of shadow of this secret, discreet star, engaged, allergic to the show-business brightnesses, of which one will not have completely pierced the enigma. 
An honest man, to the direction more noble of the term. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman obtained the dizziness to the film buffs this weekend, while clatter its big roles on the black screen of the memories. 
More of a half century of a seventh American art in constant mutation marches through him. 
Return to jostle themselves in memory the cow-boy of charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual spouse (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a burning roof adapted of Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closer of us (1990), one evokes his sensitive mister Bridge, disrupted in his old age by a marriage that did not fill all its promises. 
So of other Paul Newman are passed to the history. 
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by hate), of Robert Wise, a destined role to James Dean, resume after his death, that launched really Newman in 1956. 
This likable crook in the brillantissime The Sting (Swindles IT), Oscar of the better film in 1973. 
Player of bitter and vindictive billiards in the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), it will resume the personage on the return in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, that him valut in 1987 unique sounds Oscar on nine nominations. 
This face through the ages, it was him. 
Again him. 
The eras jostle themselves through his journey. 
The young ones the know especially through the cultissime Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, trainer of a team of hockey on freezes not very orthodox. 
Its fans rediscovered it in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen. 
With a last role of godfather of the Irish mafia in Road à Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the buckle was curled. 
In opposition to several legends of the movie that loosened enough early the trade, Newman will have remained a long time in saddle, all while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its annalses and its concessions. 
The French film director Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to" the underplaying" judging its too supported benefits. 
The profession always was not to stretch for the beautiful Paul Newman to that the roles fell a long time all cook in the beak. 
It played nevertheless less often the first young ones that the marginal ones: neurotic, alcoholics, rotten or despaired, of which its perfect traits reflected the drifts and the revolts. 
As director, Newman revealed facets poorly known of his true bashful sensitiveness. 
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his spouse Joanne Woodward in the principal role, traced a fine feminine portrait of melancholy. 
Him that perdit his son Scott by overdose dedicated him his film Harry and His in 1984, work of modesty and of sadness. 
Among homage rain that erupted yesterday on Newman, his big buddy and former companion of weapons Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) asserted, very saddened: "His presence returned my life and this country better." 
Generosity, existence love are traits vibrating disappeared actor. 
By beyond his career of legend, obliterates itself also a militant big one for the civic rights, the ecology, the independent movie, an anti-establishment one of the drifts of Hollywood. 
One will have seen a lot his binette to hold court on jars of vinaigrette, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging the procedure of rather bad taste, although gag at the start. 
The profits of these sales nevertheless were poured to his Foundation for the childhood in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than to sit on his myth, will have been involved itself to the end. 
It left to its five girls a letter containing these sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was unbelievably recognizant of his good star. 
This was a privilege to be there." 
And a privilege for us to have followed the journey of an American so lucid artist and so generous. 
Citizen models, on the whole and in known. 
What could well make Zuschlag &amp; Company in their machines to bill? 
Soon, October 8, will begin the audiences retrieving themselves to the penal procedure in course, against János Zuschlag and its accomplices. 
The politician and its accomplices are accused swindle, in the form of an organization more criminal, in a manner more permanent and more uniform, having entrainé of the particularly important damages. Of other bosses of accusation were kept against them, as for example, false and usage of false one. 
According to the floor, money originating subsidies, was spent to personal ends, while the benefits were justified by of false bills. 
The money of the State and municipalities, about 65 millions of HUF altogether, went on one hand in the cash registers of the movement Fiatal Baloldal and on the other hand, in the pocket of certain persons. 
Their method, render public equally by loaded authorities of the investigation, was to touch the money of the obtained subsidies while emitting bills of expense, behind which ones no real benefit was furnished and thus, the associations never respected their engagements. 
According to the accusation act, a big party of the bills were false. 
For the latter, they obtained themselves notebooks of bills to the market of Józsefváros, while they made the seals to Kiskunhalas. 
For the corporation names that were going to figure on the bills, it was decided some, among others, during the turns in province of the North of the lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, on asks János Zuschlag. 
According to the deposition of the latter, it had to spot pensions and restaurants. 
For its personal consumptions, it asked a bill, on the model of which ones they realized the others bill that they were going to introduce, among others, with the Ministry of the Youth and Sports, ministry of the social matters and work, as well as Municipality of the Capital to attain subsidies. 
The bill majority was created by István Lados and by his accomplice András that according to our information, took care especially to compose the necessary files to the subsidy achievement. 
At the time of a "location circuit", one of the choice of Lados was a cafe. 
According to the two bills emitted by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place assured the restoration of a group of 90 persons, members of the association Biztos Bridge Egyesület. 
Nevertheless, according to the comments of the manager, it would have been impossible that as much of persons occupy this place, at the same time. 
Same manner, in year summer 2002, the established bill in the name of foundation Jobb that afterward will carry the name of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, swarmed with faults of forms and of bottom. 
A pension, situated to Badacsonytomaj, had not in reality that three rooms, and maximum ten anybody there could pass the night. Nevertheless, the bill mentioned hundred thirty customers. 
The transmitting ones of bills to the imagination overflowing equally fell in the excess, when they mentioned the corporation Pigal Kft, belonging also to the sector Horeca. In their accounting, or the name of Jobb or the one of the Hoppá did not appear, according to given the news to the floor. 
Farkas, the corporation manager, declared to the site hvg.hu that when the floor summoned it and showed him the bills, it knew, right away, that it was a matter of false documents. 
"The name of our corporation and our tax number were placed to a bad place on the seal." 
It added: "Beyond the form, the Fact that according to the bill, hundred persons lodged there, did not stick not more, since this establishment counts only eleven rooms, that have not as much place. 
Of more, the bill mentions also meals, and our restaurant is closed since well a long time." 
The transmitting ones of enthusiastic bills not itself not more informed on the agencies of trips of Budapest, being part of their choice, but organizing only trips abroad. Thus, naïvely, they indicated stays in Hungary on bills to regulate in cash, which goes equally in opposition to the practices accountants of the agency. 
Of surcroit, as it appeared at the time of the investigation, they added also the VAT on these documents, while the benefits concerning the trip activities, of which the destination is located outside of the European Union, are billed without VAT. 
All the same, the rate of VAT of the four established bills in the name of the Hotel Révfülöp to the order of Jobb was incorrect, since the corporation benefits do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. Of more, the hotel employees emit only printed bills, while the false ones were composed to the hand. 
The investigation of the floor reveals that the "transmitting" equally committed errors while mentioning as benefit the transportation of merchandise by road, that the transmitting corporation of the bills could not exercise, seen that his profile was the counsel in investment. 
Of more, this is equally for vices of forms, as types of inadequate bills and false seals, that the emitted bills to the order of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and of Biztos Bridge revealed themselves false. 
Just as in the case of the corporation Ravenna Bt. or athletic training of Kunfehértó, that all two deny to be the authors of the emitted bills in their name. 
The not forgers not more payed attention to the Fact that the corporation HIB Kft., established to Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation the moment (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal at their place. According to our information, this is for this reason that the receiver of the born corporation to have emitted this bill. 
Bill established deliberately 
Another category of transmitting ones of bills is the one composed from those that were completely conscious that it was asked for them to emit fictitious bills. 
Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, to the request of the grouping of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, established a bill to the order of foundation Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four millions of HUF. 
According to the accusation act, the manager of the corporation Collab Kft. was brought to emit false bills by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi. 
All the same, cooperated with the Zuschlags, the corporation Biogate Kft., that is currently under liquidation and that in 2003, emitted bills to the order of foundation Jobb Alapítvány, association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Egyesület, for an amount of about five millions of HUF, but behind which ones no benefit effectively was furnished. 
No financial movement took place, not more, seen that the emitted bills were canceled afterward, but that, the organisms well avoided mentioning it in their accounting. 
The following category of transmitting corporations of bills is the one of the corporations directly linked to the accused. 
Thus, the administrative delegate of the general director of the corporation Delta Trió Kft., taking care of the commerce of fuel and of vehicles automobiles, of which sits it social was at Budapest, but where it there was untraceable, was Iván Kubatov. 
In October, November and December 2005, this corporation emitted several bills concerning the sale of computer equipments, for an amount of about 18 millions of HUF. 
According to the investigation, these equipments would have been bought by the corporation Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, that was in liquidation since September 14 2005. 
The director of this corporation was a man of Romanian origin, to that Iván Kubatov would equally have sent the documents related to the corporation, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to what we know, Kubatov recognized during the investigation that it emitted bills to the order of the corporations Atlasz, Hoppá and of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that it pocketed their exchange value. 
This is precisely to the request of Iván Kubatov that of the Romanian masons created the corporations Iron bani Jos Faipari Kft. and jos-investment Bt. 
In reality, none of these corporations did not work, which the accused explains by the Fact that they did not receive any work. 
It serves himself nonetheless of these corporations, since to the request of Master Zsolt Szente, codefendant as well as editor of the acts of foundation of the corporations, it established bills to their names, to the association order retrieving themselves to Zuschlag, as the associations Atlasz and THERE generáció. 
Kubatov gave to organisms, 15 bills altogether, emitted by the corporations Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Iron bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 millions of HUF. 
The floor thought that 10% of the let us are indicated on the bills as well as the VAT went in the pocket of Kubatov. 
The man even used the corporation szi-beri Bt. to establish fictitious bills that were used in the framework of the request of subsidy of Biztos Bridge. 
In January 2006, the Association THERE generáció and Szövetség has Modern Magyarországért introduced a subsidy request with the organism of public usefulness on the part socialist, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA). 
They obtained this subsidy for an amount of two times 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the advisable objectives in the request. 
To avoid that that do not know itself, five fictitious bills receipts of the corporation Work Team Kft. were presented to the TMA. 
Besides, this are these bills that were found at the time of the carried out search in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, to the Ministry of the Education. 
At the time of the audience, a part of the accused will relate the method of manufacture of the bills, as her already had done it in front of the floor previously. 
Which could be really interesting would be that the principal accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to get up the sail on all the history. 
So far, its confessions very are not detailed, and although it promised to several returns to relate the least details, it did not again do it. 
The question is knowledge if this is in his interest, or then, eventually, the socialists would have concluded an agreement according to which in exchange for the reimbursement of a big party of the fifty millions of HUF, Zusi would carry alone the hat. 
Today, the latter probably is annoyed, since the ask for his placement in overseen residence, on the basis of an easing of its conditions of detention, fall continually in the ear of a deaf one. 
While those that caused damages a lot more important, and the authors of economical offences non-réparables, take a walk freely or less, await to their own residence the end of the procedure. Him has not this possibility. 
The psychology of the higher bid: why does one spend more money? 
At the time of sales to the bids, the buyers tend to spend more, and to overestimate the merchandise. 
The researchers in neurology and in economy of the University of New York succeeded updating the neurological and economical bases of this behavior known and apparently irrational. 
According to their published study in the magazine Science, the human beings do not want to be left behind at the time of this competition type, as for example a sale to the bids on eBay, and this is the reason why they prefer even to pay a too high price. 
These research attempted to erect a neurological outline of this kind of "game" using sales to the experimental bids. 
One of the groups of voluntary ones played loto, while the other group took part in a sale to the playful bids, while using a resonance magnetic functional procedure (IRMf), the researchers analyzed the cerebral active domains of the experimental subjects. 
In the two games, the participants could earn money, but during the sale to the bids of which an essential element is the higher bid of a third, the body being located under the cerebral trunk, called striatum, put itself in in a manner intensive movement at the time of the loss on the part. 
This brain party, next to several other functions, play a role in the mechanism of" car stimulation" nervous system. 
This is the reason why, according to the researchers, the climbed of the prices explains with the escape in front of the violent reaction of the striatum. 
To the support of their theories, the members economists of this group of researchers followed analyses of financial supervision. 
At the time of these, three groups overbid facing a partner, in various circumstances. 
They all simply informed the group checks real value of the product in question, and them thus carried out their placement. 
To another groups, they promised that if, what's more, they went out winning on the part, then they would receive 15 additional dollars, in reward. 
While the third group received him these 15 dollars before the bids, but the group members lost equally this money, in case they lost the bids. 
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the accent was put with the one on the victory, while with the other, on failure. 
While proving thus the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the team of the players "against failure" were disposed to higher placements than the one carried out by the group checks and the group "for the victory". 
"These results cannot be shown by any economical theory already existing. 
In fact, each of them did not explain the noted phenomena at the time of sales to the bids that by the pleasure to win and the parade in front of the risk. 
Only the methods of neurological imagery helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories while unstopping, now, on a third explanation." - Noted Andrew Schotter, the professor of the faculty of the economical sciences of the University of New York. 
The hepatitis: when must we consult a doctor? 
In the world, about a half billion persons suffer from hepatitis B or chronic C, while in Hungary, the chronic disease of the liver is mentioned among the first causes of death. 
One estimates to hundred thousand the sick carriers of the virus of the hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven thousand follow a treatment. That is of the to the Fact that often the patients do not know that they are virus carriers. 
Name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections touching the liver and caused by different viruses. 
There are a lot of similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogenic agents and the generated diseases differ of one another. 
The hepatitis viruses, according to the pathogenic genes, propagate themselves principally under two forms: the hepatitides HAS and E through the tube liqueur (for example: foods or contaminated waters), the hepatitides B, C, D and the other viruses by the blood and the organic liquids (sperme, vaginal secretion, saliva). 
For the travelers, it is in any case recommended to do itself to vaccinate against the viruses HAS and B. It does not exist any vaccine against the C. 
The hepatitis symptoms HAS appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated foods, usually, accompanied of a bad general state, of weakness, of evil of stomach and of airsicks. 
Next develops on the skin and on the white one eye a visible jaundice, the saddles become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. The cure can take two to three weeks. 
Through the world, each year, a million persons die of the form more serious of this pathology, as the cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by the hepatitis B. 
The principal cause is some that of after the estimations, only a patient on ten receives a medical treatment. 
The hepatitis C can equally have serious consequences: if she is not treated, she can take to a cirrhosis or a liver cancer. 
Most of the patients does not know itself attains virus, because the pathogenic gene destroys in a manner sly the cells of the liver. In a lot of cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years. 
Consequently, a precocious prevention is very important, as well as tests of uniform screenings. 
Contamination a lot more student than the average among a population of three groups: the persons having undergone a sanguine transfusion before 1991, the consumers of drugs and the tattooed ones. 
Currently, one amounts to 200 million the attained patients of a chronic hepatitis of type C in the world. 
Since the disease can be detected by a routine examination in laboratory, it is counseled to consult his doctor treating as early as the symptom observation of unknown origin. 
The disease can be healed, if she is detected on time. The virus can be eradicated organism, of this manner risks it contagion disappears and the development of a cancer is warned. 
September 30 is the world-wide day of the hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by the organisms representing patients of the four corners of the world. 
His objective is to attract the attention on the cirrhosis of the chronic liver, caused by the viruses, on the causes of his development and on the importance of the precocious diagnosis of the disease. 
The one that grows in God does it feel less the pain? 
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would work as an analgesic sort, that already would have contributed to return more bearable the death of Catholic agonies. 
British the Newspaper Telegraph published an item according to which of the researchers of the University of Oxford realized an interesting experience while analyzing to which level the belief in God could influence the tolerance to the pain of the human being. 
In the framework of this experience for the less strange one, 12 Catholic swellings and as much of atheistic ones were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a paint representing the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, the Catholic swellings were able to exclude a big party of the suffering. 
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, one was equally able to discover that the Catholics were able to activate the party of their responsible brain of the regulation of the pain. 
This analysis is the first one of a series of experiences, to which ones of the academicians, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university. 
More precisely, the experience unfolds itself following manner: an instrument emitting sparks and broadcasting the electroshocks is set up on the left hand of the experimental subject. 
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look at in a manner supported two paints, the one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato to the 17th century and the other, the Lady to the hermine painted by Léonard of Vinci to the 15th century. 
The researchers to the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evokes a sort of state of faith among the swellings, while the choice of the paint of Da Vinci, not very different of the first one, concerned his soothing effect. 
The experimental subjects passed a half an hour in a scanner MRI, and during this time, received 20 electroshocks in four party succeeding itself, all while looking at be the paint to religious theme, be the one to more general theme. 
The Catholics declared that to the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "in security", as someone of which one "takes care" and they are themselves "calm, and peace invaded them". 
To the view of the paint of religious thematic one, they realized 12% of pain in less than when they looked at the work of Léonard. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, that has himself take part in the experience, thinks that one can attain the same effects with other any strong picture, with the atheistic ones, to condition to find the fitting photo. 
"We should find a picture facing which they react very positively, as for example a mother or a father", declared the psychologist. 
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, greeted the results of these research. 
"The faith practice should change and in a lot of cases, changes effectively our personality", added Wright. 
After these excellent results, it no longer remains than the question of which knowledge would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if one shows to the swellings a Madonna painted by Léonard or by a painter of the same calibre? 
The view of a Virgin Mary of better quality would provoke better results? 
You you divulge to your subject 
To the occasion of his tenth birthday, Google asserts that one can find it at the far end of the people pocket in the same way as the sky above their head. It knows where they spent their vacation, which specialists they consult and which are their interest centers. 
This is not nevertheless again enough, according to Eric Schmidt, that is one of the influential persons of the corporation. 
While in the matter of the skeptical ones drawing a parallel with the vision of horror of Orwell, these do not see exactly the bulk of the web 2,0. 
Eric Schmidt declared, there is little, to the Financial Times that principal ambition of Google is to muster again more information on its users. This is necessary for that the founders of Google can respect their initial objective that rang as follows: "Let us collect in a system all the news of the world!". 
According to the leader of Google questioned, after ten years of a work of world-wide mess, they always are not that to the beginning of their objectives to be able to treat all the news. 
To the question: that there will it have in five years? Schmidt replied that it would like that Google can reply to questions as "That could I do tomorrow?" or "Which is the work that would go me the better?". Nevertheless, software will not be able to reply to this question kind, simple at first sight, that the day where they will know some enough on the users. 
It is not perfectly clear for all the netsurfers that the used words during research on internet, the address IP of the computer that launches the research and the consulted pages next by the persons interested precisely are indexed. 
By the intermediary one program Personalized Search launched two years ago, the users are able, for example, stock their clean historic one of research and can consult what they looked for, on what they clicked. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, programs basing itself on the same logic, will be in a position to give responses a lot personalizier ones, and we will submit products and services on the basis of our preceding declarations and of our recorded preferences. 
Qu'arrive-t-il if someone uses my data against me, if it looks at which is my work? ask the users, that worry visionary the monopoly of information of Google. 
In most of the cases, this is the potential strength represented by the corporation that can give rise to fear, and this is not the remord, the punishment fear, the desire of liberty or eventually offends it against the strength that can give rise to with the netsurfers one against reaction. 
This is nevertheless a fact confirmed that the in demands terms not only are recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of the netsurfers. 
The example more resounding of the latter times probably is the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the news that it had harvested on the public page called Orkut, allowing thus an identification. 
The concerned netsurfers of the rights of the person were able to push a sigh of last May relief, when Google, arm over under with the lawful electronic protection organism EFF, proved his straight voucher to the court facing the FBI. According to the returned judgement, in the future, Google not yet will not be able to be obliged by anything of the points of the constitution to divulge the news on the secret request of the FBI, of some nature that this be. 
(At the same time, the federal government obtained with success some 50,000 addresses web and 1,000 terms of research that it had won in comparison with the law reinforcement on the protection of the child, voted several years beforehand. But in the last analysis, it does not succeed obtaining itself the lists of the research of the private users, or the entire list of the sites internet and words keys of these two last months.) 
The judgement of Google is therefore rather contradictory: it is castigated by those that fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer some when they begin using the services Google. Consequently, they attack themselves to them in the revolt spirit that one shows against the multinational proud corporations of their conservative picture. 
During this time, the culture geek American and its "wild stock" meeting the fascinated, the activists and the users enthusiasts of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of the big businesses, the "connected corporate body", as opposed to his rival, Microsoft, labeled as world invader because of Windows, and this, even if both of them fight for the same objective. 
That can explain by the Fact that Google, in contrast to Microsoft, does not ask its users of code of identification, does not ask any money for its applications. The code documentary and the program package, continually refreshed, has an effect a lot more accessible, younger and more cool, facing the practice of the official giant of the software. 
The reason also can be as the geeks see very exactly problematic relation between the rights of the person and internet, and what the web 2,0, the word key more proclaimed of the latter years, pulls exactly behind him. 
In fact, the web 2,0 does not concern something else that the collaboration, that the Fact that intentionally leave us tracks behind we, and that we use the canals of put communication at our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remainder it same: one exposes oneself. 
A young one, usually, can hold a profile on several public pages, of Facebook to Xanga, and it even can link up these to other benefits, as for example to Twinter, or to last.fm, listing its musical habits. Next, it can link up these to a pursuit system, as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young ones also can hold blogs, in which these appear automatically their more recent galleries of photos than they stock on Flickr or on Picasa. 
While one can peruse numerous examples, as the one of the girlfriend that easily understands to the photo view in the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with that his unfaithful friend passed the evening, or the one of the corporation that dismissed one of its employees, nothing that for the sincere opinions that this one wrote on his blog about the Be on of a thing: the term of private life is totally to reconsider these days. 
The one that lives a life online, is constituted of what it shows of himself, and is as well as one can define the principle hiding itself behind the behavior of the young ones of today. 
The one wants to hide something, or less, wants to try to bypass the monopoly of Google, can do it (while beginning, for example, with Scroogle, using the system of research Google, but, to the same moment, not leaving intentionally any track). 
The number of persons that, deliberately, do not record themselves on public pages for that it be not possible to rediscover them, is not least. The services of Google online, while going through the word processing to the picture treatment, to the information reading can be replaced by alternate versions, that are not related to huge parks of waiters and that do not assemble our better profile, having existed until this day. 
The public opinion awaits, without really itself to hide some, the moment where Google will unveil his true nature. 
The corporation, with his current value of 156 billion dollars, is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). The advertising domains AdWords/AdSense threaten the sales of the agencies of advertising, while the introduced benefits to a more and more important speed cause serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs. 
Nevertheless, observers criticize find, next to all that, contradictions having disturbing effects: for example, top management of the corporation refused, in his entirety, the protests of the employees, after she doubled the price the maternal one of business and after the corporation judged too costly the daily multiple restoration, taken does not import when. All that seems derisory next to the Fact that already in 2006, Google consented in front of the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the corporation detects all the results that injure the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese system. 
According to one of the internal rules of the corporation, the new services are not announced that when they can be used. What is on is that in the next months and next years, they will let the world budge on again points. While some think that the project of scan and of archiving of books and of magazines of Google takes so important dimensions that the corporation goes under little to rediscover itself facing the supreme Court of the United States, of others tremble in front of his system Health, for in this one, one can construct a complete medical profit from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems. 
The Fact that Google brings up a basis of genetic data can give a good first matter to the next generation of authors of science fiction. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, writes with semitones orwelliens, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a manner scaring nothing that through them given of Google. 
Two minors helped to let the tracks of the double disappear homicide of Ózd 
"The police summoned two minors to question them in the matter of the double homicide of Ózd. Of after the founded suspicions, they helped to let the crime tracks disappear." - Declared the Spokesperson of the commissionership department of Borsod. 
The young ones recognized the facts that are reproached for them. For the moment, they are accused complicity.

The stock market of the values of Warsaw proposed two hundred million Euros, about five billion crown Czech, for the buyback of 100% of the package of actions of the stock market of the values of Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the stock market of the values of Warsaw, confirmed this suggestion that the Polish did despite that, previously, Czech excluded the stock market of Warsaw of the circle of the new potential owners of the stock market Prague. 
The cause of this exclusion is that the stock market of Warsaw is located to the hands of the State.

According to Czech economical the Newspaper E15, the suggestion of the Polish represents the offer the more student that was done so far for the buyback of the stock market of Prague. 
According to the Czech press, the stock market of Coming, the transatlantic stock market Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of New York, the stock market of London and the Deutsche Börse made an offer until this day. 
Petr Koblic, the director of the stock market of Prague, declared last week that among the interested, stock market of Warsaw would be the new owner the less voucher, and did not exclude the Fact that that could result in the disappearance the stock market of Prague in the future.

The financial crisis from the standpoint European press 
In their commentaries on Tuesday devoted to the international financial crisis, worsening itself from day to day, the newspapers leaders of the European press already evoke a "second September 11". 
"The global financial catastrophe, one has it to the American president" - accuses the Newspaper of Rome, The Repubblica. "The president even was not able done pad with his clean party behind a law suggestion, improvised to the avenue quickly, aiming to come to the aid of an appalling position. ..” 
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as evoked it the millionaire Warren Buffett, it is more fitting to talk about a second September 11. 
A part of it in a hurry madrilène sees equally the scapegoat to Washington. 
According to the vision of the Newspaper El Mundo, this are the breaches of the direction politics of over there that brought the world-wide economy by the collapse. 
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system believes itself every day, and afterward, the entire world goes to pay the strong price. 
The plan of Bush was far from being perfect, nevertheless according to the congress vote, a real danger threatens, the one that Washington does not propose any political tool to treat the crisis. 
The world-wide economy hangs in emptiness, just the moment in the capitalism history, one of the bigger transformations takes place. 
One cannot be unaware of the threat a long time - underlines the tages-anzeiger of Geneva. 
Certain states again can stretch a spare tire of salvage to their financial organisms staggering, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them bankruptcy. 
Of course, so again more of banks collapse such of the dominoes, then or financial means, or of new improvisations will not be sufficient. 
In the long term, we need that the states of the European Union attach little importance to their national selfishness, and that they centralize the check above the financial divided markets. 
Nothing that Monday, the financial organisms weaken received more than 100 billion Euros - recalled Viennese the Newspaper, Standard Der, that adds that the fears according to which ones the European taxpayers also will have to put the hand to the pocket, very deep, in a manner similar to the Americans with the intention of to remedy the crisis, become more and more realistic. 
So far, THE E.U. did not really take care of the crisis, that, as a tsunami, crosses, of party leaves some, the old continent. 
The "rescuers" must not brandish right away hundred billion Euros, on the other hand it would be wise themselves they noted in which case it would be rational to touch on the money of the taxpayers, with the objective to warn bigger damages. 
The intelligent automobile imitates the bumblebee flight 
Which method would be better to develop capable of technologies to avoid an obstacle, if is the imitation of a detector of obstacles already existing in the nature? 
As for example, the one of the bees. 
In the astonishing project presented at the time of the CEATEC, taking place at Japan, the bees humming gave the strategic idea of departure to the engineers of with Nissan, to inspire them on the manner of which they must conceive the next generation of detectors of obstacles. 
In collaboration with the university of Tokyo, Nissan constructed a mini car robot, a system to car automated order bio-inspiré, of type BR23C, that it equipped qualities of the bees, the final objective being to encourage the perfect of a system able to avoid all the obstacles. 
At the time of its flights, every bee constitutes his clean space, of oval form, that in reality, resembles a lot to our shell of reassured protection - explained, at the time of the exposition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the department research and development and public relations technologicals of the brand. 
The eye to bee facets plays an essential role, since it is able to see in all the directions, in an angle of 300 degrees. 
To imitate the eye functions to facets, the engineers approached the idea of the télémètre to laser. 
This one identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and to a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the edge microprocesseur, that the transforms in maneuver of évitement right away. 
The obstacle perception takes place in a second fraction. Next, the car mini robot, imitating the bee movements, changes immediately the direction of its wheels while the turn of a sufficient angle to avoid the collision. 
In contrast to all system existing currently, this maneuver of évitement unfolds itself completely in a manner instinctive. 
"If it not some was thus, the car mini robot could not react enough quickly to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory Mobility and project car automated. 
She must react in a manner instinctive and instantaneous, since this technology corresponds to the layer more vulnerable and the most internal one of the envelope of protection, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable. 
All this process must reflect what the bee does to avoid the other bees. 
The process must unfold itself in a wink. 
To the opposed bees, the difference cannot go up, towards the bottom or in diagonal, she can be only of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn. 
Of this manner, instead of the infinite combinations that possess the bees to avoid the other bees, in our case, one was able to use only the rotary movement, acceleration as well as the slowdown as maneuver at the disposal of the car mini robot 
The BR23C uses batteries Lithium polymère that are lighter and of which the concentrated one of energy is bigger, which returns their length of longer life than in the version lithium-ion. 
According to Andoh, this is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is essential, not the treatment of the data, and again less the capacity to stock. 
This mechanism must treat only some signals entering per second, and react to these. 
It is not necessary to stock them and to react with the intuitive logic basing itself on the data of the previous maneuvers. Of this manner, it uses only some dozens of kilobytes of memory in continues. 
One needs not memory of a capacity of giga-octets, or even of méga-octets. 
This is the first step towards the conception of a technology serving to the instantaneous évitement. According to the estimations of Nissan, this system will do his enter into the mass made cars in the ten next years. 
Another application could be his incorporation in the navigation system by satellite GPS, for that it can guide the driver towards his destination while avoiding the obstacles being located on his way. 
One even gave a name to the out price baby 
The written version of the plan of economical salvage of 700 billion dollars, aiming to repurchase the doubtful credits of the banks, and to use in several times, is ready. 
To the first turn, the half of this sum will be spent. 
Reuters announces that during new debate extending itself even after midnight, Saturday, local hour of the coast is, the leaders of the Congress came to an agreement with controversies existing since days and days, around the plan of salvage of a total amount of 700 billion dollars. 
"We carried out a serious step forward" - declared Nancy Pelosi, the president democrat of the American Room of the representatives, according to which it no longer remains than to put the agreements on paper. 
The compromise, been born from the plan, is supported by the two candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
The American secretary to the Treasure, Henry Paulson, declared while commenting on the compromise results that the program will work and will be effective, nevertheless of others measure again must be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not question, here, salvage of Wall Street, but to let the economy wheels turn in the other feels. 
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening to 20H, local hour of Washington (Monday to 2H in the morning, according to the local of Europe Central hour), but did not provoke spectacular amount in the stock markets. 
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first one to vote the law suggestion replying in the name of law of economical stabilization of urgency of the year 2008. Next, his goes out will be between the hands of the Senate. 
Saturday evening, the President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi, then, the White House equally greeted the new one agreement. 
"We satisfied attained advances this night, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy" - declared Tony Fratto, the Spokesperson of the White House. 
Besides, the program diverges initial suggestion fact by the administration Bush, that she, mentioned that the 700 billion dollars had to be spent in a single time, for the title buyback concerning doubtful credits. 
From now on, maximum the half of the sum of 700 billions can be spent. The first 250 billions will be delivered immediately after the law adoption by the Congress, probably Monday. This first sum will serve to the secretary to the Treasure to buy the doubtful credits of the banks, while the usage of the 100 billion dollars additional will be left to the discretion of the President. 
The program will be supervised by an independent organism, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will take a stand equally. 
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billions depends on a new decree of the Congress. 
To the terms of the law, the secretariat to the Treasure will be able to set up a combined strategy: it will be able, at the same time, buy the doubtful credits, titles concerning hypothèques and doubtful hypothèques, as well as of typical others of credits "toxic". 
The competent persons of the ministry declared that the buybacks can take place in the framework of a sale to the bids, but also directly. 
The rule gives the possibility to the concerned corporations, to take part in an assurance program, where the secretariat to the Treasure guarantees the tools to the worry origin, for which the businesses will have paid an equivalent premium to the predictable damages. 
Henry Paulson declared that the law furnishes the necessary tools so as to consecrate 700 billion dollars for the urgent needs of the financial system, that it is a matter of the vast buyback of the doubtful credits, of their assurance, or to avoid the risk to see the system entrainant the collapse of one or the other important financial institution. 
"We will take the necessary disposals, to be ready to the law application, as soon as she will be signed" - it added. 
On the other hand, the bank leaders being located in bad postures and awaiting the assistance of the State can expect that their departure compensation, called all simply parachutes gilded besides Atlantic, will be put a ceiling on by the government. 
The salary plafonnement is mentioned only in well precise cases. Of more, the limitations depend on the manner of which the secretariat to the Treasure proposes his assistance to the business. 
The principle of the plafonnement means that if the secretariat to the Treasure repurchases in the framework of a sale to the bids, they will remove A Surplus of tax on the gilded parachute, unless the president of discredited bank leaves for the retirement. 
Directly after the buyback of the doubtful credits, the government will intervene in a manner aggressive to assure itself that the amount poured to the leaders is not exaggerated. 
For that the picture be complete, it is necessary nonetheless to add that the gilded parachutes existing are not modified. The plafonnement concerns only the new contracts, this to motivate thus the participation to the plan. 
This is the first time in the history of the United States that of the legal plafonnements will be in force concerning the salaries of the general directors - commented on the commission president in charge of the financial benefits of the Room of the Representatives, the democrat Barney Frank. 
Of more, the State obtains itself a right of acquisition of parts in the banks taking part in the plan. Of this manner, the risk of the taxpayers diminishes, since they even can be winning in the matter as soon as the economy and with her the banks saved will fall again on their paws. 
The law project mentions that in the five years to come, the President must introduce with the Congress a suggestion that will rule on the manner in which the losses will be returned to the taxpayers, from the financial sector. 
Of the two sides, there was evidently those that expressed their doubts in comparison with this plan. 
This is not for that that the American citizens authorized us, this does not protect the dollars of the taxpayers - declared the republican representative of California, Darrell Issa. 
His colleague democrat of the Ohio, Mary Kaptur thinks that this are the even that in a hurry the taken one measures, that those persons in charge of the collapse of Wall Street.

This financing plan, having for objective the thaw of the crisis of Wall Street and market of paralyzed credit, became the central question of the presidential campaign.

The magazine of press of the German linguistic territory 
The right camp is intact, this is only to the heart on the part that the voters became more conscious - this is as well as evokes the Der Spiegel, the weak score of the CSU in the Bavarian country. 
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of the red and black ones. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the edition internet of the magazine of German left information, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his entitled item "The revolution in Bavière devours its fathers". 
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began well before the sad duet beckstein-huber does not take its functions. 
The Christian socialists transformed the Bavière during decades and now, this are these same modern citizens that turn them the back. 
This era change is at the same time the problem of Christian the whole democracy, and therefore, equally the one of Angela Merker. 
For the CSU, failure was not all to surprises, but Sunday, arrived to term a process that was probable there is of that, all just ten years: the indisputable domination on the part national finished itself. 
There is of that ten years, in 1998, the CSU collected itself with 47.7 percent, and this for the first time since the fifties, with a score underneath the level of the 50 percent. 
That repeated itself three years ago at the time of the elections of the Bundestag of 2005, c'est-à-dire to the era of the so evoked Stoiber. 
The cause can to be ascribed some to the modernization "devouring its parents", set up in the region in a manner solid by the CSU. 
That does 40 years that the sociologists announce that but they strongly cheated themselves concerning the rhythm. Nevertheless the sécularisation, the results of the education and the establishment of Germans of the north and east in the region of Bavière, in the middle of the development, could not remain without consequence on the fidelity of the voters CSU. 
A modernization keeps pace with the timeliness increase, and the consequences of a such political are equally visible. 
The right camp is intact, it is only inside the party that the voters became more conscious, more critical and more persisted. 
It is astonishing equally that during the latter weeks, this be exactly the groups of classical citizens that rather moved away itself from the CSU, such as the independent, the craftsmen, the possessors of the ferry and the graduates of superior studies. 
In these groups, the support to the CSU lowered underneath 40 percent. 
Say in a hurry (diepresse.com) 
In his entitled item "That? With that? The party presidents are held on the reserve facing the coalition questions", the Newspaper Austrian conservative takes care of the position of the political confused interior that installed itself after the Austrian elections. 
The Austrian socialists of the SPÖ desire to discuss with the conservative ones of the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP forbids to the SPÖ to mix of its internal matters. 
The populist party BZÖ shows itself open for negotiations. The greens do not want again to come to an agreement on the coalition. 
The elections took place, now all revolve around the coalition; at the time of the organized debate to the public television, the party leaders have scarcely to leave to glimpse their cards. 
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that it desired to discuss with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that the collaboration of the two parties is effectively possible - this is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership. 
The question according to which it would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice chancellor, remains opened from Faymann. 
As it mentioned it, the orientation schüssel-molterer was, in any case, rejected. 
One retorts of this combination is outside question. 
Molterer reacted with prudence to the suggestions of the red ones. 
As it already said it, a collaboration will be surely fruitless if stretched Faymann to interfere itself in the internal matters of the ÖVP. 
In his party, the choice of the opposition or of the enter into the coalition is momentarily a question completely opened. These points must absolutely be debated within the ÖVP. 
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZÖ, shows itself again open to all suggestions. 
"To avoid the coalition of the red and black ones, we are ready to assume governmental responsibilities" - declared Haider. 
Járóka declared: It is necessary to break the incorrect circle of poverty and segregation 
Today, began, to Paris, the European Summit for luck Equality, of which the host is France, as representing current presidency of the European Union. 
In his exposed message in front of the plenary assembly, as one of the principal spokespersons of the consultation of experts, Lívia Járóka, eurodeputy Fidesz Party European Popular, attracted the attention on the segregations in the education, for this is a right violation that touches the more the children roms and therefore, one of the principal brakes to their success in life. 
In the name of the French presidency, this lecture of high level was opened on one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of the Work and Social Matters, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European commissioner loaded work, social matters and equality of luck. 
Among the invited persons to take part in the consultation, one finds the European social partners, as well as the most eminent representatives of the lawful protection and civil European organisms, in the domain of the equality of luck. 
According to the office of press of the group of the representative Fidesz Party Popular, Járóka warned that next to the noted distinctions at the time of the hirings, the roms disappear from the work market, in first place, following their weak qualification. 
"A majority crushing young roms do not possess any diplomas of secondary one, and consequently of an elementary education of bad quality, only a minute party has the possibility to obtain a diploma of superior studies." 
Besides, Járóka insisted on the Fact that the education as elementary right of the human being plays a role key when one must emphasize the basic straight others. 
The investment in the precocious education of the children roms means a reinforcement of the economy of the member nations of the European Union. 
According to the eurodeputy, it is necessary to let these reports to become aware of in a circle more possible wide, equally between the roms and the non-roms. 
In fact, earlier a child rom begins the school, more it increases its luck to become a productive member of the market of the work; by the paid taxes from his income and of its consumptions, it participates in the budget of the State. 
"Of by their nationality of the European Union, the roms must be assured of their right to a quality education, and to be protected from an education of weak quality and sectarian." - Underlined Lívia Járóka. 
According to the delegated one, a collaboration of the oriented European Union towards an objective and an action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of the schools. For that, the respect of the directives of antidiscrimination existing and in preparation is of an essential importance. 
"It is necessary to break the incorrect circle of poverty, segregation and unemployed. It is necessary to give the possibilities assured by the democracy to the children roms, for that they can participate as citizens of full right in the future of Europe" - demanded Járóka. 
In the name of the" European Year for the Equality of Luck" assured for all, the objective of the Summit for luck equality in organized Europe each year since the summit to Berlin last year, is to assure a unique plateforme to support the taken measures in favor of the equality of luck and for the fight against discrimination, aimed at the European level and. 
CSU: the grace for a transition period 
This is in October that will be taken the decision concerning the go out of fallen duet huber-beckstein 
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads did not again fall, and the debate on the personal questions to the summits of the Bavarian CSU was postponed. 
The president on the part, Erwin Hube and the regional government leader, Günther Beckstein, again can preserve their place. The question is knowledge even when will last the grace? 
The go out of the tandem, having undergone a loss of disastrous voice of 17 percent, will be at the order of the day of the congress on the part exceptional, held the last weekend of October. 
The members of this very criticized pair have, in any case, does to feel that they did not hold specially to their seat. 
Thanks to that, they employed themselves to appease the furious members of the fraction and basis, that a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority. 
There is of that five years - it is true, again under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, to the summit of his career - the Christian social union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, it remains only 43.4 percent of their force. 
For 46 years, the CSU was the" sovereign unique" Bavière giving 18 percent of the German PIB. 
But, the conservative ones always count strongly in this south region, of importance key for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be constrained to the coalition. 
As one of the first signs of an internal réaménagement on the part, the vice president and the federal minister of farming, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, equally received a place in this modest group of recognition, that initiates discussions to test with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free, formed Electeurs alongside the right, appropriate values. 
A foot of strange nose of the destiny was that using the list of the Free Electeurs, enters into the legislation the Gabriele Pauli, of which it taken of measure against Stroiber used possibility of putsch perpetrated by duet huber-beckstein, for next to treat without consideration the very ambitious municipal political woman. 
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilize, of a manner or of another, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, that so far pulled the strings in the slides, will receive equally an active role. The regional and former former government leader president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the day more bitter of his political career. 
Monday, Huber launched some acerbic remarks towards the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved a lot more of support from the party brother. 
Of other politicians CSU interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and equally for Angela Merkel. 
After the elections Bundestag, that will take place in September 2009, Merkel will not be able again to be chancellor that themselves they put back on foot somehow or other, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005. 
According to Merkel, hiding with difficulty his disappointment caused by fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not influence in a manner negative the big coalition of Berlin. 
Which is nevertheless relative for it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the social democrats always lasts. 
Since 1946, the SPD attained its more bad results with 18.6 percent in Bavière. 
Lukasenko - its rivals: 110 - 0 
No opposition representative attained the byelorussian parliament after the elections of Sunday. 
According to the Russian observers, that explains by a country directed by Alexander Lukashenko, that assures him prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for the Security and the Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), that explains by committed illegalities at the time of the counting of votes of the votes. 
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers of 43 countries, does not recognize the elections. 
Although the legislature composed from 110 persons in this country of 10 millions of inhabitants happens very well opposition since of long decades, before the elections of yesterday, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of Democratic United Forces (ODSZ) hoped seriously that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate of president for the fourth time at the time of doubtful elections, on the tracks of the modification of the constitution in 2006, Presence of some representatives of the opposition to the parliament. 
Of this manner, the ODSZ renounced his boycotts foreseen to the origin. 
The Fact that Byelorussia, depending economically more and more of Russia, would want to improve its reports with THE E.U., where because of the political byelorussian qualified order of undemocratic, Lukashenko and several high placed politicians do not receive of aim of entry, was the one of the opposition expectations. Byelorussia has of the to take a credit because of the decrease of the importations of natural gas Russian, always dearer, and contributed thus to the passage of the corporation Beltransgaz, owner of the drivings of gas crossing the country, is passed to the hands of the Russians. 
The Fact that the OSCE, at the time of the country evaluation, put the accent on the positive changes rather than on breaches, as for example the ban to present itself for a third of the candidates to the opposition, prohibitionist a previous appeasement. 
Nevertheless, the communiqué of the OSCE of Monday already protested the country, during which the bulk of the candidates to the opposition could not appear in the media, and particularly the Fact that the opposition could not be present at the time of the counting of votes of the votes. 
Despite all that, the opposition feels anyway a tangible improvement in the political system: the political prisoners rediscovered liberty, and Minsk is ready to small confrontations with Moscow, always while refusing to recognize the Ossétie of the south and the separated Abazzia of the Georgia. Now, the Russia with that Byelorussia forms a confederacy on paper, consider the two independent territories since already a month. 
"We did two steps forward, and a step behind, but the most important one is than the dialog was begun between Byelorussia and THE E.U." - declared Alexander Milinkevitch to our newspaper. 
According to the candidate to the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that that remains thus, despite that "the strength was afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to do to enter even a single opposing". 
The opposition does not foresee any actions of protests to the result view. She tries rather to send his message on the necessity of economical reformations with the voters. 
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns that way: we must do to print our newspapers opposing in Russia, local authorities deliberately hinder us with regards to the broadcasting, but I can note also as they are more and more to support the elections, even in the circle of the elderly persons" - declared Milinkevitch, prohibitionist the Fact that in Current of Lukashenko, that considers the social security as his principal result, the layer of the retired the most sustained ones officially does not consider it more really as fitting. 
"Legal successor of the debt of the country and increase of the commercial deficit, the collapse of the social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', no longer is than a question of time" - estimates Milinkevitch. 
In contrast to the politician of the opposition, the Russian observers qualified the elections of democratic one. 
Serguei Lebedev, leader the mission of the Community of the Independent States, declared to the agency of Russian press Ria Novosti: "The people do not believe in words, but in acts.". Of this manner, the absence of the opposition is only the proof of the maturity of the byelorussian voters. 
Brunetta: "Has to leave today, breakfast before the work". 
Never, in the history of the Palace Chigi, no had not had doors turning for the entry and the go out of the employees. 
But to leave d 'today, is in force this new measure against the small cunning one, against that not at all and next will drink the coffee to the bar during the hours of work. 
The novelty anti lazybones was presented today by the minister of the Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the general secretary of the presidency of the Counsel, Mauro Masi. 
"The doors turning- relates Brunetta- are an instrument for more better to work, with more of productivity, more of presences and more of services" precise the minister. 
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency. 
"This is réformisme" underlines in addition Brunetta. 
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Counsel completes itself with the Palace Chigi. 
According to Masi, "the choice of the turning doors is important even from the standpoint symbolic. 
No resistance from the employees was recorded, assures the general secretary: "This is a process divided by the employees, and we had the collaboration of all". 
In brief, more of breakfast during the hours of work; more of or growing coffee. 
Promise of Brunetta, that suggests in smiling, "a good cappuccino to 7H in the morning is an excellent one and healthy resolution". 
At the time of a lecture to the Superior School of the public Administration 
Of Rome, the minister communicates that" 'in three months, the absences of disease of the public employees reduced themselves of 50%, be 60MILLES workers of more in a year ". 
And it adds that it is essential to return more effective, the Public Administration. 
Italian, "of which the wage dynamics- explains the minister- these 8-10 last years doubled in comparison with the private sector, and well besides the rate of inflation. 
To the same moment, thousands of public employees, are themselves united to protest the norms of the decree Brunetta done recourse to the Codacons. 
"" While the minister of the Public Function spreads today them given concerning the absenteeism decrease on the work place for causes disease- writes the association of the consumers- the people of the" lazy active" continues to increase. 
In fact, in Italy, thousands of employees of the correct Public Administration and productive, met to declare the war to the illegitimate norms contained in the decree. 
In particular, to the Tar, one protests the exclusion of additional benefits in case of infirmity for causes service; the extension of the schedules of the schedules of house permanence of the sick worker, during which these are carried out the check visits, as well as of other contained aspects in the new disposals desired by the minister. 
Accidents on the work place, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention" 
Every day, in Italy, one counts 2,500 accidents of work, 3 deaths and 27 persons that remain in a manner permanent disabled persons. 
In 2007, the data Inail confirm in fact, that the white deaths were about 1,200. 
Figures that indicate phenomenon seriousness that remains one of the principal causes of death, and provokes almost two times more death than the homicides. 
To have the institution attention, social forces and means of information on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58th national Day of the victims of accidents on the work, institutionalized the second Sunday of October. 
"Disturbing data broadcast by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the latter days, confirm the importance of the subject of the prevention on the place of work", asserts the president the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, at the time of a sharp message to the president of the Anmil, national Association of the mutilated and invalidate work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The boss of State expresss his" sincere assessment for the associative continuous effort in prevention favor on the work places, the protection of the injured workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and the sensibilisation of the public opinion" 
"Naturally indignant, everyone hit with the fist to put an end to such tragedies that, of by their dimension, give rise to the clamor of the media and the participation of the public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics. 
Napolitano does not hide that" there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in the formation and information" 
The numerous promoted initiatives in the school sector, assume an importance all special one for a taken one of more direct conscience from the young ones that enter into the working world. 
It is of our duty, maintain the attention towards this phenomenon, not under to evaluate the alarms on social seriousness, apply and improve the legislative norms. 
Of his side, the president of the Room Gianfranco Finished underlined to the how much one" this phenomenon of the white deaths constitutes an absolute social urgency, that insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all the institutions, to do a concrete effort aiming at there to put fine quickly". 
The data of the injured ones on the work seem to signal a light positive tendency, but that does not prevent that the number of white deaths is nonetheless impressive" underlined later the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not wish that this" tendency to the reduction" translates itself indeed, in a minor attention, for this is exactly when the attention relaxes, that arrives the tragedy. 
"We believe that usually, one does not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of the accidents and contrast can be carried out thanks to of multiples actions." 
"According to us- underlined Mercandelli- more of checks and of inspections are necessary, just as a more important intervention on the formation of the workers, and this, as early as the school." 
- It added- "that it is necessary to still to cause an effort in the matter of the communication and the sensibilisation of the public opinion. 
"But it is necessary especially, a bigger direction of the responsibilities from the employers facing a phenomenon that represents a social urgency." 
"Mercandelli next denounced" the progressive deterioration of the conditions of safeguard of the foreseen compensation for the work victims" and the" diverts from assistance towards which the system orients itself the latter years". 
"Objective therefore, is to give again to the worker guaranteed it assurance – it added- so that the destiny of the one that has an accident, must not depend on the spontanéisme or expansion of the legislator" 
Reader Mp3 pointed of the finger, they put to risks hearing. 
Music Ecouter to full volume for an extended period using musical portable devices such as the readers Mp3, can cause permanent lesions to hearing. 
Here which announces the European Commission, that, in a broadcast communiqué to Brussels, quotes the opinion of the scientific Committee, on the unforeseen sanitary risks and recently identified (Csrseri) of THE E.U., published today. 
"Of this scientific report- read we in the grade- it spring that 5-10% of those that, for a period of at least 5 years, listen music to full volume using portable musical devices, during more of an hour a day and a week, risk a permanent loss of the auditory capacity." 
"I am worried on account of the fact that a number so important of young ones that use frequently portable musical devices and movable telephones to full volume, can damage inconsciemment their in a manner irreparable hearing" asserts Meglena Kuneva. 
"" According to the scientific data- follows the person in charge E.u.- it is a matter of a clear risk and we must react quickly. 
What counts the more is to sensitize the consumers and return these information of public domain. 
We must reconsider in addition, the check systems existing seen the scientific opinion, so that they be totally effective and can follow the new technologies" 
Brussels asked the independent scientific Committee, to examine the problem, seen the intensive usage of the musical portable devices and the increase of the number of young expositions to the noise that these generate. 
"The scientists concluded the executive E.u.- confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will examine now with the States members and the somewhere else interested, which measures eventually could be adopted for more better to protect the children and the adolescent ones, against the exposition to the noise originating portable musical devices and similar devices. 
It already exists an European norm of safety that limit the level of noise of the portable musical devices to 100DB, but the worry increases as for the auditory damages that could divert from an excessive exposition to such noise sources. 
It is possible of well to limit these data done recourse to solutions as the reduction of the levels and length of exposition to the noise. 
The scientific Committee E.u. points out that the musical portable device users, that listen music to full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, surpass limits currently in force relating to the level of noise maximum consented on the work place. 
Those that listen music in of such conditions during extended periods, risk a permanent loss of the auditory capacity after 5 years. 
That interests 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to the vicinity of 2.5 and 10 millions of persons in THE E.U. 
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to let the Commission leave for the capital future. 
Today we begin, in March finish us, in June will pull us them are. 
Here the calendar fixed by the Capitole for the works of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capital", that took places this morning, to the new seat, behind the Thermal Baths of Caracalla. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will perfect the directives for Rome. 
In March when they will have finished, the Committee and the community Counsel will evaluate the analyses and the projects, in a manner to present in June, the strategic Plan for Rome with the" official stamp "Capitole and of his mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
"" The commission is absolutely independent; all the ideas more political, more social and more cultural there are represented- is anxious to underline Alemanno- she will have to propose ideas of development of Rome of which will be able to serve themselves the political décisionnaires, that remain the Committee and the community Counsel. 
No role layering, but only the will to have a corner where to elaborate a big project for Rome. 
In March, she will have finished its tasks and will disappear next, for this experience must have a precise temporal length. 
In June announces the mayor- will present us the strategic plan coming from the work realized by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. " 
For those that accuse the Commission to be useless, seen that its opinions will not be constraining, Alemanno retorts: ". All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as quality of its suggestions. 
If the quality there is, as in France thanks to the Commission Attali, as besides to Rome, I am some on, his provision will be basic. 
Too often the political one is overwhelmed by the management of the Newspaper and urgencies that show themselves time in time. 
We, on the contrary, we want to see of the before, and far, towards a deeper forecast, working seriously to the development of Rome and of his future." 
In addition, the mayor of Rome is anxious to underline that "this Commission is not an useless organism or a bureaucratic body: she is absolutely free, and will not cost an Euro to the Roman city-dwellers, and will serve to student and do to participate the better intelligences that express the Capital. 
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary a preliminary sketch of strategic reference, or or motionless farm, in order to allow our city, to improve, that of which she has absolutely need, all while thinking about his future now a unitary spirit,". 
A future that, precise the mayor of Rome, "will not limit itself to the habitual community borders, but that will look at more far" not only from the perspective future city metropolitan and of his lawful statute of Capital, but" also in comparison with the role as Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and Mediterranean". 
Obama? The first president Anti-american. Here why. 
A famous American politician that is anxious to pass for independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second president Anti-american. 
The first one was Jimmy Crankcase, that, of party its decisions, destroyed the economy WORE and had reports (as besides it always has today, as private citizen) with the enemy Islam." 
The attacks against Obama increase while the date back to the elections compares themselves. 
A lady of Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition". 
Obama really is seasoned: it believes that it will win the highest function of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators! "! 
In reality, it is an attack matter that do not say big thing; this are evidently attacks of racial nature, and do not reply to the question of all the voters: will it be a good president? We have in addition the polls, that declare all that Obama will win and with a good advantage. 
In this case, it is a matter again of someone that speaks with the heart and not with the brain. 
A newspaper of the Mississipi, in the intestines of the south of the United States, wrote an item: once in the telephone booth of vote, we know well to that the American patriot will give his vote. 
Here that emerges a mentality American maintained secret aspect until the end. 
"Say what you want, we will see ourselves even to put the cross, on Obama or on McCain. 
There are even persons that swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States. 
Never revealed things until now, to such not at all that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain. 
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for the democrats is George Bush. 
One asked 1500 persons: which were the errors committed by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent replied: the Iraq. 
America changes. 
To the Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent back at her place to kicks to the buttocks. 
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers died, and the Americans were not constrained to pack the suitcases. 
Despite that, the Iraq was, mostly, the point of weakness of Bush. 
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge spot to accomplish. 
Wore, the economical debacle does itself to feel even with the journalists: in the press, is the hour of the suppressions. And a lot accuse Internet, this" murders" paper newspaper. 
Five hundred American journalists were shouted at by the PEW Research Center about the statute of their profession and mental check for the future. 
And well, almost all the journalists are today pessimistic as for their future. 
Nevertheless, they did not declare ouvertement to the attached information, to feel less worried about the credibility. 
They do not feel isolated as formerly. 
The problem of the American journalists, this is money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economical model. 
In addition, the carried out suppressions in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to the newspaper assembly, are a big problem. 
This is a problem that must be resolved, according to the interviewed journalists, if one wishes that the traditional journalism such as the general public hears it, does not reduce itself in a manner consequent. 
An evident one but complex pessimisme invades the American journalism. 
Six on ten senior executives and journalists of newspapers of printing press are convinced that the journalism at the national level is following a bad way. 
Locally, the executive group is at 65%. 
Printed publication against broadcast. 
The journalists have not any poorly to see where goes the web. 
The biggest houses editors travel a passage towards Internet, perceived by a lot as" the assassin" paper newspaper. 
The "economical pressure" that feel the journalists is increased until 79%. 
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted to put themselves to the technology hoping that she "do voucher something" for their journalism. 
Today, the tear more big in the American journalism lives between that direct the newsrooms- c'est-à-dire the directors- and put back them that work for them. 
56% of the directors at the national level, are convinced that put back them divide their values, while at the local level, this percentage descends to 23%. 
For certain, that is linked to the "work safety". 
The directors that think to lose their work post in the space of 3 years, are of 47% at the national level. 
In the matter of the journalists, one goes to 30%. 
The one of the "sure work" to the level staff (our editors, ndr) in America always is to the day order. 
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. 
In an immense nation as the Wore, with 300 millions of inhabitants and thousands of journalists, reviewed, radio, TV and Internet, the employers offer often what they want, and that becomes quickly a question to take or leave. 
The directors receive almost always big salaries, while the editor can win 10MILLE dollars a month, besides the retirement and the assurance payment. 
As for the vacation, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third one, until 15 days in all, passed a number of years. 
But, according to their revelations, the American journalists, are often "sick" during the year. 
This is the climate fault. 
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS HAS GROTTAFERRATA. 
The president of the second section penal of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, that had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling to Rome. 
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the instruction framework relating to the climbing unipol-bnl. 
At the time of the process to his load, last week, it had obtained the placement in house liberty transformed in obligatory residence to Grottaferrata. 
Its lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent can traverse the trip of the city of province to a dwelling in the capital. 
According to the court, of such movements (that the pm did not grant) would allow for him to influence his corporation and to have access to the proofs that the accused. 
The elite in danger. 
The phenomenon already had shown itself some days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, in contrast to the plan of salvage of 700 billion dollars approved by the White House: a good significant number of Americans was, and the east again, more been very interested in to punish Wall Street than to save the American economy. 
And this is well the New York Times of yesterday that we confirm it communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, again more divided between his eve soul East Coast, moderated, in favor of the federal institutions as well as to the business community, and his new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to" those of Washington" and to the finance world, powerful especially in the States of the Center. 
The soul, exactly, that did itself to feel in a manner despotic with the vote of which I spoke to you at first. 
Nevertheless which has just been quoted is only a change example, big changes that the economical earthquake in course preannounces or well already leaves to run: not only to the United States, but in all the West, and can be not only that here. 
To the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to let the brooded phenomena accelerate since some times, to such not at all that, in the new climate, they solidify themselves and reveal themselves. 
The first one of these phenomena is the réactualisation, restarts it extraordinary, double category State- sovereign, in comparison with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis, in fact, is an institution bank financial crisis that have, evidently of narrow reports with the foreigner, but that, before all, are implied on a large scale, the reports of the persons and families that live in a single Country, in a single State. 
That creates immediately a political problem for that the citizen: that is to say as to reply to difficulties and to the protests of the persons and families that are in addition a électorat. 
In brief, the crisis appears economically world-wide but politically, she is not almost that here national. 
The political internationalization seems really out game or well, has not big thing to say: the evident proof furnished us by the European Union that, divided as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, does not arrive to decide any political line town. 
And thus, this is government of every State that all await interventions, plans of salvage and of restarts, new rules, and especially an affection of credits: when one crosses a difficult period, there is only the States that possess the economical resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put back the things in place. 
They possess also the necessary means and the légitimation to use them: two resources of an inestimable value, elements of which no market or international organization never will be able to dispose in a manner analogous. 
This new pomposity of the crisis state nation is remainder in perfect harmony with always major importance that the economical developments more recent of the economy stretch to attribute to a factor enough linked to this element: territoriality. 
. Paradoxically, in fact, while we had convinced of henceforth to have entered into the network kingdom, technology always more artificial, material, convinced no that the globalized finance henceforth was destined to dominate the world, we realized a blow of a single one, that our future will have on the contrary to regulate its accounts always more with the things enough not very material as water,. 
Things that certainly can be transported from one place to another earth, but that are secured in a manner absolute to a space circumscribes, to a territory. 
Thus, that is sovereign, possesses certainly more cards than the one that is not it, c'est-à-dire, the one that has the misfortune to live in a place without harvests, without oil and neat. 
I arrive now to the second novelty that nevertheless foresees a break. 
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Political, and therefore Leadership. 
In this respect, the economical crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena. 
Of a quotation, the conscience of the need objective of authoritarian leadership, the research of a person that know to take in hand the position. 
Quoted other, a disrepute wave for the leaderships existing, economical types that revealed themselves inadequate and a lot of zone of shadow. 
And in addition, something even deeper, in a certain direction, even disturbing: a disrepute, a suffering, a picture of unsuitability, a feeling of remoteness that stretches to imply the entire class of the directors in a number growing Country of the West. 
Thus increases again more the conviction of the various classes, before the actions be the same ideas of the social elite until now to their apogee, their manner to listen and to be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to always be more foreign to the majority opinions. 
in brief, The request of leadership, supply in a manner underground, a powerful and ramified movement of délégitimassions of the classes directing and traditional political orders, that show themselves in the" offend" electoral improvised or well, in the changes of collective moods of the latter all last times, from the conservative ascension in Austria Bavière, to the fall of the Labor ones in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the (And it can himself although the right victory in Italy did not arrive by chance). 
One has the impression that the traditional elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their intellectuals accredited, their format, would say someone, always have more difficulty, which does not date any today, to understand and therefore to represent the put to bed deep of the western corporations, and that the economical crisis reinforces, increases and shakes potentially in a manner excessive. 
To the view of all that, to talk about a current one "mass rebellion" to the day order, seems frankly exaggerated. 
But one says well, keep the big open eyes, that is not without reason. 
The supercolle to walk on the walls. 
Overcome the seriousness laws thanks to a great glue and, in the future, walk on the partitions as Spiderman. 
Here the objective of various centers of American research, and today, a team of four institutes there has almost succeeds. 
With an adhesive one measured scarcely 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers succeeded maintaining stuck a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical partition. 
The ETUDE- The American magazine Science published the discoveries of certain researchers of the University of Dayton, of Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Forces Research Laboratory. 
Equipment, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those that we know that use a special structure of carbon, called nano tubes of carbon. 
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of willing tubes as a spaghetti battery." Explain Zhong Linen Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta. 
The scientists inspired themselves paws of the geckos, covered with hairs microscopiques that allow assuring to the animal, an adhesive perfect one. 
The carried out tests on various materials, such as the glass, the Téflon, and the sandpaper, showed that the adhesive new one is ten more powerful time than the paws of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "detaches itself easily partition" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the faculty of Engineering of the University of Dayton. 
WALK ON THE WALLS? – "This equipment could be used as temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai. 
Can be to walk on the partitions as Spiderman? Can be that yes, but the researchers think about an a lot usage less fascinating such as the connection between the electronic devices, seen that the nano tubes of carbon are conducting heat and of electric current. 
Of other applications could concern space engineering. 
For the moment, no great hero. 
The OTHER RESEARCH- THE University of Berkeley, in California, seen itself she also, to the research of a new adhesive one. 
In an item of the American magazine American Chemical Society, the Californian researchers presented an adhesive one formed of microfibres as hair, that itself car cleans dusts during the movement on an area to guarantee a perfect one and constant adherence. 
Medicines: never with fruit juice. 
Attention to grapefruit juice, of orange one and of apple. 
These drinks, consumed especially the summer for quenching the thirst and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital medicines, some impair the absorbement amplifying or diminishing according to the cases, their effectiveness, with serious same consequences for health. 
David Nailey, professor to the University of Western Ontario in London, recall the risks of the fruit juice that they be, some drunk or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain medicines; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in course to Philadelphia, it launches a new one alarms: it suffices of a glass of juice of grapefruit, of orange one and of apples, to reduce the absorbement of Their beneficial effects and putting to risks patient health. 
Grapefruit juice already strongly was criticized for responsible withholding to increase the effects of certain medicines anti arrhythmic, antibiotics, tranquilizers, anti staminales and neurological, even to toxic levels. 
MEDICAMENTS HAS RISKS- THIS IS the Italian Agency of the medicine itself, that had given the new one in an information bulletin dated back to two years, warning the doctors and patient to not under to evaluate the danger diverting from this mix and to pay attention to which one drinks, if one takes medicines as for example, the Diazépam or the Méthadone. 
NOT THAT THE GRAPEFRUIT- according to the experts, even the juice of orange one and of apple contains substances that inhibit the medicines. 
Long is the list of the active principles inhibited by the grapefruit and the other juices. 
Of there, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are usually, immediately signaled to the various national and international agencies of medicines that will have to the need, change the informative grades of the medicines. 
It always suits to read the illustrative papers of the medicines that one takes, and, if something is not clear, not to do itself to impress, but to address itself clearly to the doctor or to the pharmacist" underlined the expert to the agency Ansa. 
The economy Nobel to Paul Krugman. 
The price Nobel of the economy was attributed to the American Paul Krugman for its research on the models of commerce and on the location of the economical activities. 
Krugman, 55 years, is a Keynesian neo that sign to the University of Princeton and it is in addition a famous editorialist of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the bigger critics of the solutions in economy and foreign political administration Bush. 
Some months after the attempts of September 2001, during the days of the bankruptcy of Enron, Krugman had written, in a published item on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more determining than the first one, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States. 
An anticipation that roused many debates, and that was accused the economist during years, but that now revealed itself exact. 
"I am surprised and even a little shocked rapidity with which to remember it scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the public attention" had declared Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, executive committee of the European central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of big value", but also a divulgateur to the style" very aggressive, particularly critical towards the excesses of the liberalism of the administration Bush. 
Open Office, here the third edition of the package "ANTI-Microsoft" 
This is the day of the broadcasting of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the continuation open source of personal productivity that aims to always touch and again more of users, house in the office, professionals to the public administration, proposing an alternate free one to the most famous Microsoft Office. 
After a work of almost a year, realized by voluntary developers, overseen by SUN Microsystem, the new package Open Office shows itself to the general public with various novelties: screen of welcome, and the reviewed interface and become less austere, to more important others, as born compatibility for the system opératif Apple Mac BONE X, and the support for the new format ODF (Open Document Standard version ISO. 
Open Office did particularly attention to the interaction with the continuation Office 2007, and it is in fact possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (. docx,. xlsx,. pptx.) 
So interesting, certain specific functions to certain units, as the one that allows reducing the dimensions of the presentations PowerPoint, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import line PDF in the unit of graphic elaboration, preserving the original aspect of the page. 
Always on this forehead, it is possible to create documents "PDF cross" that unite the typical graph of the format Adobe to the elements of a leaf of calculation or of a élaborateur of text. 
The collaboration between several persons is an element that had various improvements inside the applications: in the calculation leaf, various users can intervene, avoiding the conflicts on the modifications, in text elaboration, for to every assistant is attributed a commentary color for a better recognition in revision phase. 
Certain corporations even are working to bring certain functions of OpenOffice on the Web (one the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks, they should emit the final result. 
The Italian version is déchargeable to the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and adds to the English version that was located on the mirror since Friday. 
Besides to Windows and Mac BONE, the continuation is as usual available in addition, for the system opératif Linux. 
On asks, the installation cd can be dispatched to residence or on the work place. 
And if the wantonness theme can be a means to broadcast it in the houses, is exactly in the business, that Open Office the stretched continuation the big challenge, already being able to count on various realized projects in the public administration and the schools. 
Without counting the realities that offer a formation service, consultation and of assistance, ideal for the small and average businesses, that can besides to open towards forecasts of business. 
Open Office is composed of five principal units: Writer, for the video equivalent writing of Word; Calc, is the calculation leaf that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival presentations of PowerPoint; Dbase, such it famous Access, is the program that allows working on the databases; at last Drwa is graphic unit. 
Objective for 2008, arrive to 5 millions of download, and considering that today one counts almost 3 million and 600 thousand, it is probable that with the go out of the new version, one even can surpass the figure foreseen 
Kohl also, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping. 
New case of positivité to the last Tour de France: it is a matter of the Austrian of the team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and conqueror of the shirt of the better rock-climber. 
This is the site of the Newspaper THE Equipe that retrieves the new one. 
To 26ANS, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist to the Cera, the Epo of third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, them also of Gerolsteiner. 
The sanguine analyses carried out on the test-tubes of Kohl are part of the one realized the latter weeks, by the laboratories of Lausanne and chatenay-malabry. 
If the against analyze confirm the positivité to the Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place to the Turn and will have forcement to discount two years of elimination. 
The new one positivité of Kohl to the Epo of third generation, was confirmed by the boss of the French agency anti doping, Rock Bordry, that communicated to the Associated Press, to have notified the positivité to Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian of 26ANS placed itself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, swiping thus the shirt to pea of the better rock-climber. 
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES WONDERS IF ITALY IS RACIST? 
Italy "as Country of emigrants recently transformed themselves in a privileged destination for the immigrants" welcome with reluctance. 
That would it transform the Beautiful country in a nation of racists? Here on what s'intéroge itself the New York Times that dedicated a long item debating theme of the racism in Italy, leaving the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, native of the Burkina Faso, killed the last month to Milan, to have flown a cookie wood. 
This case makes obvious which the New York Times defines as the "north paradox" : the Nordic regions at once the one where one records" more of integration and more of work", but also" a feeling anti-immigrants the more fort of the country and the most important support to the Lega North" 
To confirm tension growing between Italians and immigrated, the NYT did also reference to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castle Volturno. 
Not only. 
Even the new term of office desired by the Lega to brake the immigration and facilitate the expulsion of the clandestine ones, is quoted as proof of the change of climate in Italy. 
Tendency underlined by the Pope as well as by the president of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano at the time of his encounter with Sanctimonious XVI to the Quirinal, asked what the State and the Church work together to overcome racism." 
Etudiants victims of the dear rents, until 900 Euros for a room. 
The housing market for students not connait of crisis 
According to the last investigation of the Sunia, the union of the tenants, rent a simple room can cost to a student, until 900 Euros to Milan, 700 to Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome. 
"The phenomenon henceforth attained very serious aspects to the point to exclude from the entire categories of young, right to the study because of the global costs very students that the origin families must support- explains the person in charge of the office of studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong request from the students so distorted the market. 
In most of the cases, the housing offers behave in addition a violation series: contracts of free type, recorded nos, without rent limit, under housings. 
For the Sunia, interventions extraordinary by the intermediary one revision of the fiscal imposition, are necessary for calm the prices. 
Reading in detail investigates it, we see that to Milan, for a bed in the zone Brianza, it is necessary about 450 Euros; for a simple room, one goes of 650 Euros minimum (zone Band Nere), to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine, and Will Trust) to a maximum of 900 Euros (zone Vittoria) 
To Florence, a bed costs in average, 350/400 Euros, a room about 700 Euros. 
To Bologne, where the students concentrate in the close zones of the University, it is necessary 250/280 Euros for a bed in a double, and of 370 to 500 for a simple room. 
To Rome, in the close zones of the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), one asks about 600 Euros for a simple one, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Values lightly lower (550 Euros for a simple one) for the close zones of the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
One can save only if one moves away oneself in the peripheral zones: 300 Euros for a bed, and 450 for a simple one in the zone Predestina, Centocelle or similar. 
To Naples, for a bed it is necessary 300/400 Euros, for a simple one, one spends of 400 to 600 Euros, with higher price in the zones Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei. 
To Bari, for reads, it is necessary to count 250/350 Euros, at least 350 for a simple one. 
In the smaller cities, the prices are lower in absolute term, but they have a major importance in the economy citadine. 
At last, the cities such as Perugia, in which ones the housings often are taken by community first rate students, one records a later abnormality: the required rent to the foreign students is increased by 25/30% in comparison with the one applied to the Italians. 
Old farewell movie Paradiso, the cities éliment the historic rooms. 
The rooms of historic movies close in favor of the Multiplex. 
"A city without movie rooms is a blind city, this is as a face without eyes" 
The picture offered by the metteur in scene Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what it happens in the big urban centers Italians, but also in the province cities, 
The process of marginalization of the movies, with the birth in periphery of the big multisalles, and the death of consomption of the mono rooms in the central zones of the cities, is one of the major events that we appears inevitable and undisputable; it has what's more all the characteristics of a true cultural crime. 
To disappear, this are often historic and loaded places of memory, "this is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone that one knows, with which divided us an end of way and so many emotions" observes the metteur in scene of the Nuovo movie Paradiso, film that offers to Tornatore it there 20 years, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the juror of Canes, and Of a room of province, and the nostalgia of a manner to live the movie, lost can be for always. 
The figures furnish by Anec, the principal association of the merchants, want all to say: these five last years, 316 movies of traditional type closed, and this are the rooms of the principal cities that some especially paid the expenses: 10 of less to Florence, 9 to Milan, Naples, Bologne and Rome, 6 in less to Turin, 5 to Palerme. 
Among the regions the more touched ones by the closing, the Roman Emilie is in head with 82 mono movies lost rooms, followed by the Tuscan one (44) and the Lombardie (41). 
The proof that confirms t that the first person in charge of their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, for this are well the three Italian regions that recorded the most again movies multisalles: 195 screens what's more in Lombardie these five last years, 81 in Tuscan as in emilie-romagne. 
"Italian exploitation developed in a manner irrational" observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to construct new structures, but it would be necessary anyway to guarantee the survival the one that already exist, for when a room closes in a city, these fréquenteurs not necessarily all are disposed to go to the multiplex. 
To say nothing of the missed deliberation of the credit in favor of the merchants: the debt antécédente of the State is of about 10 million Euros. 
It is shameful that, from the standpoint étique and morale, the Government does not respect the laws existing. 
To support the sector, it would be necessary between 16 and 18 million Euros per year. 
Note the case of Bologne, the first Italian city that, worried of these closings, decided to resolve the position thanks to the signature of a protocol between city Hall and Anec, the first one of this kind in Italy, to defend and promote the mono movies rooms of the historic centers and in periphery. 
Among the normative ones foreseen, there are measures of fiscal opportunities in favor of the managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: the spectators will be able to enter into the zone to limited circulation, and will have special tariffs for the parking and in certain parking lots. 
"This is an initiative that pleases me" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that of other cities will follow the example of Bologne setting other up measure. 
It is nevertheless evident that, to contrast the great power of the multiplex, the traditional rooms also must improve the quality of the sound and picture, for the public of today is more demand. 
The defense of the traditional movie is a theme that for me, always was important: the closing of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me of do "New movie Paradiso" to which one I thought already since 10ANS. 
I live to Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Through Nazionale, henceforth closed, there where I so lived divided emotions, I turn myself quoted other in order not to to see the panels darken by dust. 
Links between political and 'ndrangheta, stopped mayor of Gioia Tauro. 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was disposed to standardize the choices of the city Hall to the interests of the clan Piromalli." 
Of heavy accusations are launched by the magistrates of the Direction antimafia of the Calabre, towards the mayor and the vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, stopped this morning for external competition for association mafieuse. 
The hand-levers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous of the slave over, already condemned for association of malefactors of type mafieuse, as well as to pay 10 million Euros. 
"An insult towards the normative lawful one and morals, and especially common sense" write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultations to Master Piromalli. 
"Thus one would have been granted to the clan -write the judges- to enter officially inside the city halls facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, of check and of orientement of the public administration" 
The regional Calabrian committee president Agazio Loiero, does not hide that of the "collusions between the local committees and the organized crime, there are some more of one" in his region: "There are places where the intensity mafieuse is stronger than in of others, where collusion is almost inevitable. 
But there are also a lot of politicians that withstand the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes that are honest" 
The arrests of this morning follow the one of last July, continuation to which ones the police announced to have decapitated the clan Piromalli. 
As early as the end of April last one, the community counsel of Gioia Tauro had been dissout; already in 1991, and always because of presumed packagings between the organized crime and the local administration, the local politicians had been offloaded their function to manage the City. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the dissolution, had been named boss of a coalition of upright center, after the runoff of May 2006. 
It screamed to the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the community counsel. 
It accused the vice minister of the interior to the era, Marco Minniti, the accused to have hatched the all for a political question, but seen the request of signed committal this morning, the judges explain that the clan Piromalli had even succeeds asking the variation of the project of l'A3. 
Leaving ordered interceptions against Dal Torrione, the pm write, is emerged "the availability to get married the requirements of a businessman, representing of a group more known, close of the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the clan interests. 
When the energy is born of the waves, now the big one launch themselves. 
Here an excessive deposit that occupies more than 70% of the area of the planet and now the big world-wide companies of energy are discovering it. 
Vague, running, tides, here the new renewable sources on which ones of the giants as Chevron put the eyes, and now try of there to put the hand. 
The possibility to obtain from the energy from the sea movements is studied since henceforth cents years, and in the years 70, in concomitance with the first oil crisis, the research intensified themselves. 
When the price of the oil lowered, about 1980, the idea to exploit the marine energy was put aside, but now the instances ecologists and the new increase of the oil give a big leap to the sector 
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated in 2007, that 15% of the world-wide need in electricity could be covered by operating systems of the swell of the seas. 
This quantity would be the double of the one that produce the central nuclear power. 
And what's more, there would be the currents and the tides.. 
Giants to the attack. 
The first business to bet on the marine energy was the Enersis, that in 2005, has siglé an agreement to construct an installation to the North of the Portugal. 
When the understanding was announced, one would have said a true revolutionary step. 
To two years of that, always more of candidates among these devoted businesses since always to the traditional energy bet on the marine energy. 
"Chevron studies currently the technologies on the oceanic energy- declared the Spokesperson of an associated company to the American oil giant, to economical the Newspaper Wall Street Journal- and she evaluates the possibilities to cooperate with us". 
The cooperation in question, concern the achievement of a permit deliberate by the American commission for the energy, necessary to give place to a project of exploitation of the marine energy in Alaska. 
Here a very interesting signal, especially if one considers that exactly in Alaska, the Wore continue to extract oil, and recently president Bush set up a project for new excavations 
Besides to Chevron, there is Turning green Power Inc. Of New York and Ocean Power of the New Jersey, that traverse the energy way coming from the sea, and are invested them until today, although their details are not known, indicate according to the observers, a growing interest. 
Tecnologie to put to not at all. 
The experts talk about a technology again to its beginnings, of party the Fact that the marine energy does not dissipate the fears towards impact ecologist. 
At the present time, the systems as those of the Portugal, or certain in Scotland, are small dimension, and do not seem to create big problem to the ecosystem. 
To produce energy on a large scale, nevertheless, it is necessary to use technologies with an impact ecologist superior. 
"And the choices are various: Ocean Power, for example, use a system of spare tires linked to one another. 
The wave sprout, that does to budge muds up and the bottom, is converted in a hydraulic pressure of the let us track and cylinders inside the flotteurs. 
The pressure does to turn a turbine that to his turn, supplies a generator. 
The energy is sent to the shore through of the cables under sailors. 
For the moment, we have access to four systems of this kind in project phase, while waiting for a unique federal approval and a part of the energy could serve to a military installation. 
Turning green Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a commercial center and a parking lot using six turbines under navies of the East To Fasten New York. 
The water movement at the time of the tides, does to turn the turbine blades, creating a movement rotatoire that supplies a generator. 
Turning green announced to have a long list of customers in expectation of necessary authorizations to draw energy. 
After the waves, the tides. 
A special interest, they say to the Institute for the research of the electric energy, deserves in this moment, the potential one of the tides. 
Although it is a matter of an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable of the wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as energy source. 
And this is exactly on the tide energy that of the states as New York, Maine and Alaska, with of others, look at towards the coasts, invested 7 million and half of dollars in 2008 and foresees investments until 35 million in 2009.
