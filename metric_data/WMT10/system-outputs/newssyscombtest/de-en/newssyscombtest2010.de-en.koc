Schneemangel at the Bergen quält the hotelbesitzer
Scneelose pisten sorgenn make not only the riesengebirgen-anwohnern.
The lack of schnee schreckt people by the skiaufenthalte bestellung in hotels and pensions.
That is why we can in riesengebirge still free room for all wintertermine incl. Weihnachten and silvester.
Our pages are visited frequently.
The people go through, the offers are the prices, but now they fear, to appoint verbindlich.
And if you are, you immediately anrufen questions of whether, in our view, the diesjährige weihnachtsfest on schnee "or" matsch, will be led by the operators of the informationsportals spindl.info, Martin jandura.
The silvester-aufenthalt who in the spindelmühle just after his ideas, should no longer with the bestellung zögern.
Anyone who prefers the SAVE and where the quality of the aufenthaltes only in second place, the can still try to wait a few days.
The spindelmühle-hotelbesitzer now offer for the silvestertag überwiegend only wochenaufenthalte.
I think that it is still a long time to try to sell them, but then you must also give kürzere comment, and at times.
And then the free room quickly schwinden, jandura estimated.
Betten free to all winterterminen always always offers the travel agency ingtours in vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the weihnachtswoche, meanwhile, is not yet ausverkauft.
In our offer is approximately half the seats are still free.
That is why we already have some preisgünstigere weihnachtsaufenthalte prepared for the last moment, the director of the reisebüros ingtours, Petr schiefert,.
The silvestertag in riesengebirge can also vrchlabi-reisebüro anbieten yet, but there are fewer freier seats.
Also good (find the first vierzehn days in February, the rest will be sold wintertermine on average.
This year is the interest of the winteraufenthalte also negatively by beeinflußt that in riesengebirge always no schnee.
The people are waiting for, whether schnee fällt.
The end of the year, no one wants to spend in the Bergen without schnee.
Should the pisten within a week, which will also be verschneit weihnachten ausverkauft, thinks schiefert.
Umgekehrt and slightly better than in last year, manages the room in the hotel in pecpod snezkou horizont.
We are talking about five per cent better than in the previous year.
On silvestertag and weihnachten, we have only a few free room.
There is great interest in the Polish ferien in janua in February, and will also run the business well informed, the director of the best pec-hotels, Karel Rada.
To 80 per cent for the silvesteraufenthalte is also the Omnia hotel in zentralparkplatz occupied in janske lazne.
Weihnachten remains opposed to the latest hotel in janske lazne even half the betten freely.
Angenehm überraschte us in this year of January, for which we have at present to about 60 percent are occupied.
A bit less is now the February, but in the moment, when the schnee is also intended to increase the interest in the aufenthalten in riesengebirge, the director of the hotel, Erik sporysch Omnia.
On a more schneebescherung now wait for the riesengebirge-hotelbesitzer.
On Thursday, it should abkühlen and if it comes to niederschlägen, which should be at the Bergen schnee.
But then again, is a erwärmung informed Jiri jakubsky from the standort of Czech wetteramtes in Hradec kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of klugheit
It is almost komisch, with what schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of klügsten strategie, his vorgängers in the afghanistan-frage repeatedly that he felt himself for the dümmsten.
When he finally his sehnsüchtig erwartete afghanistan-doktrin ausschwitzte, it showed that he is this on the kopierpapier from the busch-irak-szenariovor abschrieb three years ago.
Not only that it is in the text itself several times the redensart "as in Iraq," he has even used the name of the bush- statement from January 2007 as the name of its own deklaration: "new vorwärtsweg" without zaudern used to.
While he has himself three years ago, the bush-idee frische truppenkontingente in through the bürgerkrieg geplagten Iraq auszusenden - as "unverantwortliche and in their folgerungen karastrophische decision".
Point folgende months but showed that the of the militärs empfehlungen ausgehende bush-strategie the only possible and insoweit was very successful, that today in the news about Iraq no longer speaks at all.
The image of Bush, because this was not gebessert objektiv he has his successor a much dankbarere ausgangssituation hintergelassen, as it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan hofft Barack Obama to be the miracle repeatedly.
In the truppenkontingents aufstockung have once again asked him the militärs, especially of the afghanistan-operation oberkommandeur general Stanley mccristal, even despite the subordinationsgewohnheiten protect the zaudernden in the White House severely criticised.
He urged 40.000 soldiers, the situation for the better umkehren.
The President was reluctant, but three months is not a better idea to come and as it has in the general wenistens 10.000 soldiers betrogen.
In Europe, he has the zusage for further 5.000 gepresst, even though he himself was initially at least with 10.000 gambling.
Most problematisch to the entire project, which is obama-strategie be truppen in Afghanistan already in 18 months abzuziehen, and this process is completed within three years. The whole obama-doktrin left more questions than answers.
Some zweifeln that the halbierte aufstockung the same effect as the measure in Iraq will bring.
Also, despite the bruderkrieg of recent years is the irak-gesellschaft strukturiert relatively well, your Führer honour the values.
The afghanische situation is through the kontraindikation geprägt niemanden - we can leave it will be kept and no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the afghanischen security forces, which are gewohnt, every day to change their opinion.
The political institutions, even if they were founded formell korrekt, only scheinbauten, behind which the patriarchalischen stammbeziehungen wuchern further out.
The interessenausgleich between the various groups ungewöhnlich ethnischen is complicated, particularly because of the unübersichtlichkeit the verhältnisse, the pakistan- and iran-einflüsse komplizieren still further.
Also the aufbauen a "handlungsfähigen staats" minimalistische, which is the aim of the whole operation is very unrealistisch.
The obama-strategie zeithorizont befremdet through his voluntarismus
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan is getting worse and is only now she is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the small soldiers in the kriegsgeschrei on the "frühheimkehr" ausgebrochen, here are a miracle, can only create a truly romantische seele, of facts not beeindrucken.
From the political point of view, is the datumssetzung for the truppenabzug sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban that as the indirekte confession of American defeat will begin.
The last nato-gipfel showed that the bereitwilligkeit of europäer, in den gefechten in Afghanistan to participate, to neige.
Europe's politicians can and want their voters not explain in what way the safety of Germany or Italy, with the war in hindukusch-gebirgsvorland zusammenhängt.
Another possible factor, which can affect the situation Radikal, is the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue verschlechtern and verstärkten sanctions on the iraner not wirken, is for the United States is a very serious question as to whether the problem to solve with truppen.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama on the siegerabzug schreitet from Afghanistan.
Any lösung, but also a dramatic wendung afghanischen mean the situation.
The only trostpflaster for Barack Obama is the fact that even three years up to remain präsidentenwahl, and thus there is still enough time, so that it can apply to any other strategie, fallls these as totalausfall erweisen.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs no prämienboni received more in bar
The senior führungskräfte the American bank Goldman Sachs in this year prämienboni receive no more in bar.
The firm has announced that the scharfe criticism of their lohnpraktiken responded.
A group of 30 spitzenmanagern receives money instead of shares, but only one in five years must sell.
Moreover, the shares the managers in the case be entzogen, if you act excessively riskant.
Goldman Sachs is so gemäß the Reuters at the forefront of efforts, the prämieboni Wall Street with langfristiger performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on the weitergehende direction is bewußt, in which she has led to go, the former banker JPMorgan society, Douglas, Elliott.
The problem is in the details, ergänzte it.
Goldman Sachs made to zielscheibe of criticism, having for the first three quartale almost 17 billion dollars this year for prämienboni had put aside.
The gesamthöhe of prämienboni during this jahra after the Reuters will probably also today, despite the angezeigten measure 20 billion dollar übersteigen.
The high prämienboni in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders the heißeste political issue.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it beabsichtigt, boni of banker, the 25.000 übersteigen einmalig pounds, with a tax by 50 per cent to belasten.
Similar steps bereitet, France.
This year, women have the nobelpreise in all fachrichtungen won in physics, ausgenommen.
Five rekordfrauen today have in Stockholm from the hands of deskönigs schweden Carl Gustaf xvi. the diesjährigen nobelpreise in the fachkategorien and accepted for literature.
In addition to the four wissenschaftlerinnen was under the German novelist rumänischer abkunft, herta Müller, including.

The last laureatin vergab den nobelpreis for economy, the amerikanerin elinor ostrom and your fellow countryman Oliver Williamson for analysis of the wirtschaftsberichtes have received.
The only fachkategorie, this year, no woman received a nobelpreis was physics.
This price today have the scientist Charles Kao for research in the glasfasern-bereich and George Smith together with Willard boyl for the ccd-chip-erfindung davongetragen, which is the basis of all digitalkammeras, faxgeräte or astronomischen fernrohre.
Each of these preisträger has the diplom, the nobelmedaile and bescheinigung on the erwerb of geldpreises.
The average in each kategorie schwedischen ten million kroner.
If there is any kategorie several preisträger, consumption will be shared out among them.
Traditionsgemäß, the American President, Barak Obama, the most erwarteten friedennobelpreis already today afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he has the kontrovere his ernennung recognised, because it was only at the beginning of his weges, and furthermore, is in the forefront of the country, the two kriege leads, in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In its policy wahrung ergänzte it but that kriege in certain situationen for erkämpfen of weltfriedens are necessary, even if the price is so high.
The resignation of ministers janota erwägt. Klaus has invited him in the Burg
President Vaclav Klaus empfängt on Friday morning, the Finance Minister, Eduard janota, on his verbleiben in the government nachdenkt, because it with the ausführung of staatsbudgets for the next year in the form which this through the abgeordnetenversammlung on Wednesday was not freigegeben, agrees.
It is thought that the budget and perhaps also the verbleiben janota from the cabinet in the subjects of the freitagstreffens will be.
The budget will also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the etatdefizit too high, as the crisis in the public finances further vertieft.
On the zusammentreffen informed the präsidentensprecher, radim ochvat.
On his new role will remain in his janota on Monday with the premier fishermen, negotiate, Jan.
After the budget-gesetz, which now receives Klaus to unterschrift, should the Czech Republic with a defizit of 163 billion kroner wirtschaften.
But I have been in Parliament on Wednesday to vote on the linkspartei-vorschläge geldumwälzung and the money for the staatsbeamtengehälter, for the unterhalt of sozialleistungen and direktlöhne of landwirte erhöht.
The government, the proposals of the sozialdemokratie entgegengehalten that they verdeckt the budgetdefizit erhöhen.
Between the linkspartei on the one hand, and the government, and rechtspartei Klaus, on the other hand, is therefore a scharfer innenpolitischer dispute has arisen, the dessentwegen fragezeichen on the further work of the fischer-beamtenkabinetts aufkommt, on whose gestaltung the ODS, CSSD and grüne Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it has been adopted by the House, the package of sparmaßnahmen practically liquidiert, on the part of the fischer- government in the autumn were durchgesetzt, and that after her verständnis the staatsverschuldung should end.
Klaus, of the law on the staatsbudget can sign, must not, however, said the diskussionsfrühstück today with the unternehmern that the politicians that "serious problem" that "the unhaltbare defizit" of public finances, the longer time vernachlässigt.
In his opinion, there is no good lösung more today.
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which still on a breiteren consensus of the political parties could build.
The ods-vorsitzende, Mirek Topolanek, led to that the budget is grauenvoll, and the government should their continued existence abwägen.
The ods-stellvorsitzende, Petr necas, the ctk said that the concept of the beamtenkabinetts with support of CSSD ODS, and grünenpartei apparently no longer works.
Premier fishermen in the redaktion described similar words as "strong aussprüche".
The cssd-chef, Jiri paroubek, reacted to the topolanek-worte that the etatdefizit grauenvoll is that the frühere government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and the 200 billion kroner überschreitet.
Already on Wednesday the CSSD bewertete the approval of the staatsbudgets for that next year as success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by clint eastwood played by Morgan freeman
The südafrikaner claim that the new hollywood-film "invictus: the ungeschlagene" of the world, much of the country shows of its fight and siegen despite some kritiken that the role of an American actor was occupied.
The story tells of sport, rassenverhältnissen and Nelson Mandela.
The unermüdlichen fighter against the racist apartheid-regierungssystem südafrikanischen in the Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in its lebensgeschichte of American oscar-schauspieler, Morgan freeman,.
Freeman said that he was by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he could be in the eastwood- film.
Another bedeutungsvolle role takes on Matt Damon.
I told him: "You will if I play, I have to take it.
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actor, the price for his role in the eastwood-drama from the boxbereich "million dollar baby", was already had received the Führer of movement on the abolition of slavery, from the finish, on the sklavenhalter, has become a fictional usa-präsidenten, God and also in "Evan allmächtig", but only rarely someone who still live and for many people as Mandela is so important.
The former südafrikanischestaatsmann was for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the südafrikanischen Republic of 27 years in prison.
In 1990 he was released undfür four years he has been President of the country.
In 1993, he was with the friedensnobelpreis excellent.
"invictus lateinische" is the word for "ungeschlagen", and at the same time, this is the name of a gedichtes of English autors William Ernest henley, which was issued in 1875.
The anforderung, as he was to speak
The film cites a real begebenheit, Nelson Mandela on his forces with the kapitän of südafrikanischen rugbyteams, Francois pienaar, zusammenschloss, in order for the country to some of the new President Mandela knows that its people even after apartheid still rassenmäßig and economically remains divided.
He believes that he can some people through the sport, so he entscheidet, the rugbyspieler, the world to the außenseitern, belong to some.
Finally, the increasing südafrikanische team up in den weltcup of the year in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years in order to prevent the mandela-geschichte on the kinoleinwand.
He had no other aim than to play this role, such as closely as possible to the reality, said freeman anzunähern.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he.
The actor said that if he and the weltpolitiker would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, with him on this evening and to eat before his speech behind the kulissen.
The most important thing was for him, Mandela to hand schütteln.
I have found if I give you the hand, I schüttele übernehme their energy, it will, and I had the sense that I know what they feel, he said.
For me, it is important to become a different person.
Matt Damon is in the film François pienaar, the national rugbyteams kapitän, in which the White überwogen spieler.
The actor said that he had six months' time, for the role in the harsh rugbywelt.
It was a great surprise for him, as he is on the erstenmal pienaar took in his house.
I remember, when I was in the türklingel klingelte that he opened and the first thing I in my life to François pienaar said, was: 'in the film I see much bigger from'.
Despite the offensichtlichen unterschieden in the statur the actor compared with their actual vorbildern, he was under the leadership of the film director, eastwood "invictus: ungeschlagen" positive rezensionen receive and we also speaks of aussichten on an Oscar.
The filmkritiker of blattes daily variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his auswertung in the following words: "this was a very good, very good ausgeführter film history."
In the filmrezensionen on the web-seiten rottentomatoes.com invictus, has 76 per cent positive auswertungen.
Lichtgeheimnis dissolved on norwegen: the Russians have tested a rakete
On norwegen was a besonderer lichteffekt Ursprungs unknown to watch.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has only yesterday that unweit eingeräumt, the Norwegian border a interkontinentale ballistische rakete was tested.
But the launch was not successful again and as a type of "bulava rakete, originally called" the pride of russischen army should be, will slow the alptraum the russischen generalität and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin,.
Even his repeated presence in the ground in the raketetest had no positive effect on the success of the probeflüge.
Meistens bulava is not at all or launched in the air have been beschädigt.
In den russischen newspapers one writes about "bulava" than on a "rakete, not the flies'.
A rakete, not bare, but leuchtet
This already 13. attempt to normal verlief at the beginning.
Until the end of the fluges Technische are, in turn, damage to the rakete aufgetreten.
Presumably the motor explodierte in the third raketenstufe.
"this time startete bulava" from the atom-u-boot dmitrij donskij, which under the water of the White meers said.
This raketentyp allows the abschuss from the u-boot.
It is likely that the fliegendes caused by a unbestimmtes objekt mysteriöse light on nordwegen actually the beschädigte "bulava".
In addition, the norweger since the first moment gezweifelt, not that it is a Russian rakete.
The generalität has diesesmal verwahrt against and claimed that it was not clear from a misserfolg can speak.
The first two stufen of rakete were not enough and the accident was only the third stufe affected.
In den vorigen cases have been equally the motoren in the first stufe beschädigt.
Even if no teststart without mistake was made, believes the leadership of the verteidigungsministeriums only six of 13 for erfolglos.
The almost fünfzigprozentige success, therefore, met with the generalität optimismus and this will continue to be claimed that the "bulava" even without problems and even fly until ten hyperschall-atomsprengköpfe with a gesamtgewicht von Max. 1,15 tonnen will bear.

Hyundai, the gewerkschaften after all be überstunden lifted.
The geschäftsführung the nosovice-automobilfabrik einigte Hyundai with gewerkschaft on the lifting of all überstunden.
Because often angeordneter überstunden has the gewerkschaft on Monday announced the streikbereitschaft.
The spokesman confirmed the automobilfabrik Hyundai, Petr vanek.
The geschäftsführung wants but with the gewerkschaftern still on a samstagsschicht some in this week.
We must not abandon our fertigungsplan, is a grundsatz, was therefore on Saturday, December 19. überstunden, volunteers from the reason suggested that two arbeitsschichten would be worked, said vanek.

Czech entdeckung: a substance, which also works with ´ gestählten ´ hiv-viren
The team of Czech and German scientists testet new links to the ausbreitung von hiv-viren in organismus unterbinden.
The hauptvorteil of improved substance is that it is also in the works, the viruses already resistent against drugs.
This fact überwiegt against the nachteil that the link to virus-varianten übliche not so strong, as one of the already existing medicines.
The disease AIDS can still not be geheilt.
The patients can the medikamentenzusammenstellung but the lives of the hiv-viren vermehrung verlängern and prevent in the body.
Their einnahme but of a whole series of nebenwirkungen.
Unvollständige oppression of the virus-vermehrung also has the development. Resistentviren SG to result, against the no medicinal products more effectively.
The work of the experts from three instituten the akademie of wissenschaften cr, of the vscht (chemisch-technologische hochschule prag) and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to how we can deal with the virus-resistenz.
You have shown that as metalokarborane bezeichneten stoffe in the eiweißstoff wirken, for the hiv-viruses vermehrung is responsible.
The metalokarborane are links of Bor, wasserstoff, kohlenstoff and kobalt.
This links the virus-vermehrung block in a different way than all medicinal products used today, so that they can resistenz-problem überwinden.
In its work, the scientists to reach new ´ improved ´ links which, on the basis of knowledge of the molekularmechanismus their bindung on the viren-eiweißstoff were prepared.
The metalokarborane have a einzigartige dreidimensionale struktur: two vielfächige käfige from bor-, wasserstoff- and kohlenstoff-atomen exist and by a metall-atom, in this case, kobalt gekoppelt.
Heimtückisches and beständiges virus
Hiv-protease is eiweißstoff of hiv-virus, for the lebenszyklus of the virus is essential.
Without the hiv-virus-spaltung caused by the hiv-protease would not infektionsvirenpartikel tyres.
If we reject the hiv-protease schalten, we also vermehrung of the virus in the body of the patients, the researchers explain in pressebericht, of the Institute for organische chemie and biochemie the akademie of wissenschaften cr has been issued.
In the work in the wissenschaftszeitung Journal of medicinal chemistry was published, the researchers describe the whole reihen links, in which two paare of käfige (see table) through a brief organische kette gekoppelt, the then systematisch will continue to change.
Slightly weaker, but zuverlässiger
The auswirkung this series of stoffen against the hiv-protease wurdne tested in reagenzglas, even against their beständigen (resistenten varianten), which were won by hiv-infizierten patients.
The effect of the metalokarborane on übliche enzym-variante is not as strong, as in the klinisch genutzten arzneimitteln, but they do not lose their effect on the resistentvarianten, against the genutzten medicines are often wirkungslos.
The wirkungsmechanismus einzigartige and their other characteristics, such as the biologische and chemische stability, niedrige giftigkeit and possibility of other chemical gestaltungen, power to the metalokarboranen interessanten links for further on the development wirksamer medicines aimed against HIV research, says rezacova pavlina, head of the laboratory for strukturbiologie the institutes for organische chemie and biochemie and the institutes for molekulargenetik the akademie of wissenschaften.
Because of budget dispute. ODS went to rid itself of fishermen, wehrt
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the genehmigte budget for the next year as "grauenvoll" and the Government of Premier of Jan fishermen should, in his view, consider their continued existence.
The statement the ODS described the Prime Minister as a "strong aussprüche".
It is supposedly time for analysis.
The Deputy ods-vorsitzende, Petr necas, said that the concept of the beamtenkabinetts with support of CSSD ODS, and grünenpartei apparently no longer works.
After necas the Prime Minister must decide whether he beabsichtigt, in Parliament on the minority to stützen, if it is the fight against the steigende defizit, or whether it be in office in order to help the parlamentlinken verbleiben.
The herangehen the ODS and the Social Democrats, to the issue of public defizite diametral, is abweichend has necas hingewiesen.
This Parliament has, on Wednesday, the budget for the year 2010, however, adopted with linkpartei-änderungsvorschlägen on more than 12 billion kroner.
This Parliament has the money for staatsbeamtengehälter, for the unterhalt of sozialleistungen and for direktzahlungen to the landwirte erhöht.
The government has, in the proposals of the sozialdemokratie entgegengehalten that they verdeckt the budgetdefizit erhöhen.
Should the Czech Republic with a backlog of 163 billion kroner wirtschaften.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government responded, because that, too, abgeänderte budget is only a less bad variante of budgetprovisoriums frase not clear.
Disappointment and sinnlosigkeit
The Finance Minister, Eduard janota, has about his frustration and a sense of sinnlosigkeit spoken, wogegen Premier Jan fishermen has argued that the government the jetzige situation still beurteilt.
Necas is convinced that, if janota seriously with his resignation in the fall gedroht, that would have the abänderungsvorschläge were adopted, the situation would be different.
Gemäß the Czech television has janota on Monday after the regierungsgeschäft notified the premier.
While he has angedeutet, that he has yet to be in office überlegt verbleiben.
This is why his disappointment at the verhandugn of budgets.
To what extent are fishermen for the continuing battle with the budget-defizit ausspricht, so have the nominanten gemäß necas the sozialdemokratie (CSSD), the änderungen in budget durchgesetzt, had nothing to do with the government.
The Premier also should clearly say that he will resign if the Parliament continues to defizit-steigernde laws annimmt, for example, the krankengeld and pensions or affect the dienstgesetzesnovelle.
Topolanek: by ODS nominierten Minister irrten not
It is up to the Prime Minister, fishermen and the entire government.
The ODS nominierten ministers have made no mistake, Topolanek said in a textmeldung from the USA hervorgehoben.
It has mentioned that in some ministerien stellvertretender function in people who sit on top 09 bekennen, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen darür entscheidet, on the fight against the defizit-höhe to abandon the public finances, "it is totally logisch korrekt and that he is on the linksmehrheit stützt, currently in Parliament".
He then allegedly with the support and the bürgerdemokraten toleranz not can count.
I have not thought about it, and if that will be timely, then I am going to employ, said of the bürgerdemokraten nominierte verteidigungsminister Martin bartak the journalists in Parliament.
Premier fishermen nachmittags was flying at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS trat desire to back the Prime Minister
At the same time necas stressed that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament against the geänderte budget would vote if the premier members of the bürgerdemokraten ausdrücklich would therefore ask that you allow the adoption of budgets.
We are not as waisenkinder, we are no small children, so then he responded to the question of whether the ODS in political verhandlung on the budget by abwesenheit of parteivorsitzenden in Parliament and in the Czech Republic was not zurückgedrängt.
I have not gemerkt, that my voice would lack.
As I already on the mandat verzichtete, wußte I, that it will be in the next few months, particularly if the bolschewisierung Parlaments zerstörung positive and everything would go, Topolanek itself.
After the new fahrplan the CD (Czech eisenbahn) are fewer trains for travel around the gleichem fahrpreis.
The Czech eisenbahn closed or restricted from 13. December some less ausgelastete schnell- and lokalzüge, other links will be up against it.
The whole verkehrsumfang will from the gültigkeitstag of new fahrplans compared with today at two percent.
Most tarife incl. Basis- and kundenfahrtarif will not be changed.
Several verbindungsmöglichkeiten received in the capital, for example, the inhabitants of the ostrava-gebiets, the eisenbahn, for this line of typs pendolino trains.
The schnellzug will no longer after Bratislava (Pressburg) drive.
Less schnellzüge will also be on the line - pisek prag, budweis, grundsätzlich will drive the direktverbindungen von prag after letohrad reduced.
The biggest reduction in the district is planning the eisenbahn Hradec kralove (königsgraz), a total of about eight per cent, to an increase in prag and environment can be happy about it.
Two nachtzüge also be lifted on the route - tabor budweis prag - and on some days in the week, the operation of certain schnellzüge on the line - pisek prag, budweis reduced.

This year, the regionalzüge 200 million Czech kroner more expensive.
For the lokalzüge and schnellzüge has a newly completed the eisenbahn zehnjahresvertrag, until now the Treaty was always just completed a year.
The eisenbahn lobt the system, and perhaps it has not therefore to preissteigerung in the large majority of fahrscheine gegriffen.
It is only to änderungen in eintägigen netzfahrscheinen CD net and günstigen internetfahrscheinen eliska.
For passengers without the kundenkarte will the price of 450 kroner net CD at 600 kroner erhöht.

The President of the Republic in years 1994-1999 südafrika he was elected.
Great expectations are placed in the film, because it is in a period of time in the cinema, in the in südafrika, on the one hand, the preparations for the weltmeisterschaft kulminieren, but at the same time, the media the weltöffentlichkeit with beängstigenden news about the rising rassenhass and the discrimination against the inhabitants from the Black ruling majority erschüttern.

Whether the gespannte situation improved in südafrika, that will only show.

The owner of the student agency, radim jancura, erhebt strafanzeige today because verleumdung against three sozial-demokratische Führer.
Against Michal hasek from the district, südmähren Radko Martinek pardubice from the district and the head of the bezirks olomouc, Martin tesarik.
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen inteview in radiojournal.
The complaint filed by the company with the bemühung hangs together, the regionalzugverkehr to engage in some bezirken.
All regions but ultimately have the langfristigen contracts signed with the tschechischer eisenbahn.
All three head are attacking us and say that we in the rosinen herausnehmen, we have only the offer on the scale, with them as it was voted on.
They claim that we teuer than the Czech eisenbahn, because we are the prices of Czech eisenbahn would know the vorige week were completed.
So, we have no other choice than to defend us.
Because of this verleumdung society student agency, said the radiojournal jancura.
At the same time he led in that he has evidence from all bezirken that your action in accordance with the europarecht unternommen.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek, the erhebung the strafanzeige for further continuation of the medialshow of jancura to him than kostenlose advertising for its society and for his own person serves.
I am of course prepared my good name and the good reputation to defend my bezirks fordere, and this I also further head on.
I note that on this matter will be clear that there is jancura, in the matter of the regionaleinsenbahnverkehrs manipulated the public and lügenhafte and unwahre arguments used, said hasek.
Jancura already reported last week that he several million kroner in the advertising have invested in the nachteiligen step of bezirke hinweisen.

The campaign has begun jancura after the bezirke to conduct of the regionaleisenbahnverkehrs with the Czech eisenbahn einigten and for the mission in a high about 150 billion kroner ausgeschrieben had no invitations to tender.

Vaccination against pneumokokken free of charge and freiwillig
Imfung against pneumokokken does the gewohnte from January.
It is intended as a first for the families and freiwillig free of charge.
But even now that the vote is melden, pflicht-impfung wirksamer would be.
The preparations for the introduction of kostenlosen vaccination against pneumokokken kulminieren.
The arzneiinstitut already puts the maximum price of impfstoffe notes that the krankenversicherungen should pay the price.
The fachleute are also on the impfungsverfahren in the clear.
New vaccination
Impfstoffe free of charge for august-kinder
As of January can be vaccinated against pneumokokken children free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition that they do not yet St impfdosis have received.
Anyone who has been with the vaccination in the last year has started or earlier, must also pay weiterewiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first impfdosis is between 3 and lebensmonat 5. the kindes be given.
Already voriges year a quarter of families left their children against pneumokokken impfen.
The eltern paid DKK 1600 and more for a dosis.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are needed four dosen.
On the whole, the fachleute estimate that the krankenversicherungen for the impfdosen 300.000 until 450.000 kroner per year spending.
But in the treatment they save the children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state has flächenimpfungen for all the children spent approximately 500 000 per year.
The pflicht-impfung was introduced with the sogenanntem janota-paket.
Pneumokokken mittelohrentzündung cause, but also serious infektionen, including gehirnhautentzündungen and blutvergiftung.
By pneumokokkeninfektionen die with us after investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the pflicht-impfung tschechiens was the children against pneumokokken in some 40 countries introduced.
The vaccination programme will be duty?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination in future duty could be.
As of January, this is paid by the versicherungen and freiwillig.
The pflicht-impfung beispielweise mentioned would be better, the head of the bürgervereinigung nahlas, Rudolf kalovsky.
His unification wirbt already in the long term for the pneumokokken-impfung.
The fachleute on the international conference, in which our group was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not quite the ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed, at least the.
I believe that this is the path that we now need to go kalovsky led.
The gesundheitsministerium wants but that impfverfahren against pneumokokken not change.
At this moment we erwägen not at all, said his spokesman sesen vlastimil.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors say.
The chairman of the fachgesellschaft von praktischen kinderärzten, Hana cabrnochova, is that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then it could be on the verminderung reflect the wiederholungsimpfungszahl "in a situation in which the vaccine is so teuer, we understand the political decision that this vaccination as volunteers has been launched," says allerdingst cabrnochova.
The fachleute expect that more than 80 per cent of their säuglinge eltern against pneumokokken impfen from next year.
The vaccination against pneumokokken is also is bahnbrechend that this as the first of the flächenimpfung krankenversicherungen and will not be paid by the state.
The versicherungen should spend the money for the prevention, in order to save them for further treatment, erkärt cabrnochova.
The doctors must impfstoffe einkaufen itself.
This is but one of kinderärzte sorge praktischen linked to the impfstoffe einkauf concerns.
After the initial projects should the impfstoffe through the versicherungen eingekauft and this then the doctors in the same way as well as others, given by the state to you impfstoffe ausgegebenen.
Some Members, however, feared that the versicherungen as "the money from the krankenversicherungherausführen could".
That is why the doctors will be the impfstoffe einkaufen itself and must wait until the versicherungen you pay for it.
According to the estimates, the individual praktischen doctors per month SEK 40.000 must invest, what a significant amount of money.
This will not be easy, says cabrnochova.
They and we are still
Can the Islam französisch?
And in a säkularen pluralismus pragmatismus state.
In a time when Schweizer voters for a bauverbot minarette have voted for and the concern about the angebliche Islamisation of Europe is weitverbreitet, John bowen, an American akademiker, a fundierten and wohlüberlegten report written about whether muslime in one of the säkularisiertesten erklärtermaßen societies of Europe can be integriert — and integriert.
Some readers will this new book from admiration for the final work of autors: "why the French no kopftücher love" (originaltitel: "why the French don ’ t like headscarves") (2006), and read a eleganten dicht argumentierenden study a streitfrage, the country on anderthalb decades told and beschäftigte and their effects are also still wahrzunehmen.
Bowens neustes book offers a umfassenderes spektrum and kühneres.
As good anthropologe he would not only know what the politicians and the Media, on the Islam in France say, but what really happens in the field.
He has months in mosques, schools and spent the instituten, now the 5 to 6 million muslimen in France, as bowen nennt "islamische freiräume" offer.
He is a good zuhörer, he gives debates between lehrern and students on the issues you once again, most beunruhigen.
Should a Moslem in a mosque or a rathaus heiraten (or both)?
If young muslime on evolution and rights of the homosexuellen be belehrt?
Can a Muslim woman in a nichtmuslimischen man heiraten?
It is for a Muslim zulässig, to use a zinsorientiertes banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profanen affairs, he claimed that the daily lives of ausmachen, quite unlike the political dramen, which deal with the media.
The author erkennt a new generation of imamen, lehrern and intellectuals, none of them with a familiar name, perhaps with the exception of tarik Ramadan, a in the schweiz geborenen arabisch-muslimischen gelehrten and akademiker.
This new generation, tried to open the debate on how it is possible, on the one hand, a good Moslem and, on the other hand, a good staatsbürger in a modern säkularen society.
They have not all arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are misstrauisch towards the idea of a French or European Islam.
The denker and activists who befragte bowen, with their salafi-gegenstücken meistens uneins – verfechtern of puristischen sunnitischen Islam, which, in conjunction with saudi-arabien – these days is a small but influential präsenz muslimen in Europe.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and französischer säkularismus vereinbar could be.
But a übereinkommen erfordert a give and take on both sides.
He is infrage, to what extent are French political entscheidungsträger (and the intellektuelle elite, so the trennung leidenschaftliche of church and state bewacht) really feel the pluralismus verpflichtet.
He deutet muslime, that may be a rauere treatment as Catholics and Jews protestanten, know the ihrerseits their historic compromise with the säkularen republikanismus had to make.
He erkennt rather a "tightening of werteschrauben" as a growing pragmatismus.
Can the Islam französisch? after reading this book, you geneigt to say 'yes, but not yet ".
The trostloseste ausblick in the world
The arktis is changing more rapidly than any other umweltregion and dramatischer on earth.
The EIS schmilzt kennzeichnet, which you, with alarmierender speed and adopted lives, the nowhere überleben.
Oil, gas, and fischereiinteressen schifffahrts- in the neuerdings offene water begeben, with diplomaten, lawyers and now also in their kielwasser authors.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, sets dünnem EIS in "to" (originaltitel: "on thin ice"), a naturgeschichte the ikone of the North, the eisbären.
Bewandert in the complex history and politics of walfangs, he describes the long tradition of the arktiserforscher, even in the jagd on the eisbären have shown.
Admiral nelsons encounter with a eisbären as tapferer 14-jähriger fähnrich on the sea, the only with the gewehrkolben fought his muskete, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
The young bären gefangen, as they were behind the körpern their recently getöteten schwammen mothers were, in zoos and zirkusse.
At the beginning of a zirkusaufführung 20. century showed 75 eisbären in an idea.
Even today zooanlagen have still typischerweise a millionstel of lebensbereichs a wild lebenden alttiers Klima. This is rarely appropriate: the eisbär in singapur was quite grün of the algae in the hohlen hair of his pelzes wachsen.
Klicken you here, in order to learn more.
Ellis bezieht, based on the reports of other authors and historiker kehrt and often to the threat, the Jäger for überleben of species.
Although in norwegen, America and Russia verboten, is the erlegen in grönland and Canada, where Jäger in helikoptern and motorschlitten-fahrende Inuit leistungsstarke sturmgewehre use to stretch their beute.
Ironischerweise will in den gewässern in the north of these two jagdnationen the EIS at längsten remain there.
In his new book "after the EIS" (originaltitel "after the ice") offers alun Anderson, a former editor of the wissenschaftsmagazins "new scientist", a clear and beunruhigende description of the arktis Wissenschaft and a packenden einblick, how the future is could develop.
Not about that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphärenwissenschaftler still ozeanografen schnelligkeit can explain the changes angemessen.
But this is not due to a lack of erklärungsversuchen.
The pionierreisen fridtjof nansen 19. by the end of the century and the beginning of 20. could for the first time, the verwirbelung of packeises erahnen.
Unterseeboote vermaßen kalten war in the verschiebenden grate in the unterfahren.
A useful ergänzung are satellitenvermessungen and großflächige ausbringung of messsonden on eisbergen, but still does much of unerschrockene people draußen in the kälte kampieren, achieved.
Anderson wirft a view in the eigenartige, tiny world of zuflusssystems within the arktischen eises by salzwasserrinnsale gebildet, when will the zusammengedrückt gefrieren.
But, ranging from the bär on the EIS until the mikroskopisch small wundern in the EIS, all of them are threatened, if once the sommereis vergeht, womit in the period between 2013 and 2050 is expected.

In a few months, from where we also always be zurückgebracht, we could be, said Robinson on the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would want someone täte, the same for me, therefore, I am trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6.000 volunteers who gathered on samstagmorgen, kränze on the graves of veterans in several sektionen to lay the arlington-friedhofs.
Worcester morrill, inhaber of trauerkranzherstellers worcester wreath company in harrington, maine, begründete 1992 this tradition, as he and some other entschlossen, several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington to dekorieren.
It is now a 18 years old tradition and morrill and his wife Karen, this journey each year, keep companies in various towns along the weges veranstaltungen in order to carry out the people, the militär and opfern of terrorism are devoted.

It is just as the visit of a familiengrabstätte.
In warmer clothing wanderten eingepackt were the volunteers on the heels of friedhofs ausgedehnten rasenflächen and hügel.
The volunteers were older graves from the 1 and 2 weltkrieg and the vietnamkrieg as objective, since this is not as often as neueren visited the graves, so the organisers.

The US administration auftragnehmer of kubanischen authorities arrested
The government has a auftragnehmer kubanische the US administration, mobiltelefone and notebook-computer verkaufte, arrested in the country, said representative of außenministeriums on Saturday.
The auftragnehmer, until now, has not yet been identified, is working for development alternatives Inc. with headquarters in bethesda.
The company is working to projekten for customers, such as USAID, the us-behörde for international development and for the weltbank.
Konsularbeamte interessenvertretung of the United States in havanna, try to gain access to the häftling, of the 5. December has been arrested.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after kubanischem right a kubanischer staatsbürger or a ausländischer visitors for almost everything under the anschuldigung of "gefährdung" can be arrested.
All so-called konterrevolutionären activities, the slight proteste and critical schriften einschließen Bergen, a verhaftungsrisiko.
Regierungsfeindliche inscriptions and statements are regarded as schweres crimes.
Kuba has a wachsende blogger-gemeinschaft by the populären reporterin yoani Sánchez is cited, the öfters describes how she and her husband of regierungsvertretern persecuted and angegriffen.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for approval, in order to leave the country, prices entgegenzunehmen, but it has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American auftragnehmers will probably the spannungen kommunistischen between the government of the castro-bruders in kuba and increase the obama-regierung, a "slow" annäherung to improve the relations on the island had sought.
The news of the arrest was freitagnacht first by the New York Times reported.
The new us-politik attaches importance to ensuring that the United States will provide a gegenleistung kubanische konkrete, if the government steps in this direction, as release political gefangener and creation of more room for opposition.
Mobiltelefone and notebooks are legal in kuba, even though they are new and begehrte erzeugnisse are in a country in which the durchschnittliche merit a regierungsangestellten stands at 15 dollars per month.
The kubanische government allows only since this year's purchase of a normal bürgern mobiltelefons, you will hautsächlich for the sending of textnachrichten, used as a 15-minütiges phone call a tageslohn would cost.
The internetnutzung is on the island of extremely eingeschränkt.
It is in expensive hotels and there for ausländische visitors and some regierungsstellen, such as universities, accessible.
Kubaner einloggen, which is often the government would like to have your name melden.
To many webseiten is the access eingeschränkt.
In kuba is the arrest of a amerikaners rare.
Most of the few us-bürger in kuba, sit in jail for crimes such as drogenschmuggel behind gittern, said Gloria berbena, pressesprecherin the us-interessenvertretung in havanna.
Berbena said she could give no further details on the arrest.
The arrest and the haft are clearly wrong.
A work in any other free society would be legal - the abgabe kostenloser mobiltelefone - is a crime in kuba, said Jose Miguel vivanco, head of the American sektion the group "Human Rights Watch", who recently received a harsh report on the freedom in kuba, entitled 'New Castro, gleiches kuba "herausbrachte, an allusion to the amtseinsetzung of Raul Castro as the Führer in the country, the sick older brother Fidel ersetzte.
Vivanco said that the defendants very often within a day, arrested and convicted were arrested.
He said that any lösung probably would be politically and that the kubanische government often a negative reaction in the United States, particularly on the stage provoziert, as both countries for more zubewegen dialogbereitschaft aufeinander.
Pakistanische regierungsvertreter plan to meet men after Afghanistan senden to
Pakistanische entdeckten authorities on Saturday a supposedly leading head a verschwörung, the point abzielte, five men from nord-virginia after Afghanistan senden us-soldaten to, in order to töten, and have said that they hope could help in this case, a ausgedehntes network terroristischer anwerber aufzudecken, the Internet after radikalisierten young männern absuchen.
Investigators have said that a undurchsichtigen aufständischen, known as saifullah, had sought, the men had invited to Pakistan after he found they had made, because one of them on the internet-videoseite YouTube zustimmende kommentare had made to terrorist attacks.
Saifullah, after her arrival in Pakistan the Führer of these men, and I tried to help the abgelegene area in pakistans stammesgürtel, of the heimat von Al kaida and his terroristischen trainingslager.
But a representative of pakistans geheimdienst, on the matter was unterrichtet, said on Saturday the al-kaida-führer saifullah, could not convince them that the men are not part of a cia-verschwörung to unterwanderung of terroristischen netzwerks.
As a result, they have been about days in the eastern city of sargodha, far from being held by the unwirtlichen Bergen in nordwesten, which has become a terroristenzufluchtsstätte.
They were seen as part of a verdeckte operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the regierungsbeamte, because of the sensitivity of the matter anonym wanted to stay.
The regierungsbeamte said that the men were not entmutigt and tried to continue the richtigen empfehlungen, in order to obtain access to the al-kaida-lagern to maintain, as they were arrested by the pakistanischen strafvollzugsbehörden.
The case of five men - the continues in Pakistan are and will be questioned by the FBI - emphasises the key role of anwerber künftiger terrorists in the identification and possibly even more important, in the decision as to who is vertrauenswürdig.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, it has become a matter of us-geheimdienst höchster urgency, human aktivposten within Al kaida unterzubringen.
The anwerber the organisation as pförtner wirken, not those who hereinlassen, whose commitment to the holy war is not seriously enough and such, which could be spione.
American möchtegern-rekruten from a kaida subject to a specific prüfung, analysts said.
Because of their potential to us-zielen zugangs and their propagandawertes you will but also as ungeheuer attraktiv for the group.
Evan kohlmann, the nefa-foundation ranghöchster analyst with headquarters in the United States, said terrorgruppen in recent years were also much vorsichtiger in relation to whom they become access gestatten, because the us-geheimdienste are experts in their rekrutierungsmethoden.
When one person tried to einzuschleusen in these groups, what better way than we could go, the rekrutierungsmodell to follow the so many already are followed?, said kohlmann.
Now the model is based much more on the Internet.
Zehntausende demonstranten demand in kopenhagen klima- "action".
Zehntausende demonstranten marschierten here on Saturday through the streets and demanded of the unterhändlern in bella-kongresszentrum act in the city kühneres klimaschutz.
100.000 demonstranten said that people had the veranstaltung angeschlossen, whereas the polizeischätzungen rather of approximately 25.000 ausgingen.
The veranstaltung verlief friedlich, although a handful of relatively small sprengkörper maskierter activists in the vicinity of some regierungsgebäude in the innenstadt zündete.
On a day when the of the UNO geförderten klimaverhandlungen little passierte, wanderten thousands of activists with transparenten through the city, which was in English 'there is no planet B "and one in Spanish, which said" the earth says "enough".
Some stars schlossen the protest, for example the dänische model Helena Christensen, the fotografin, said that the trips to Peru, geburtsland their mother to make her aware of just how herzzerreißenden problems the country already spürbaren due to the impact of climate change has to contend.
This is part of the beweggründe, why I have decided to participate in the large demonstration - the word weiterzureichen and to appeal to the weltführer, a faires, ambitioniertes and verbindliches agreement to bring together, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way more, the question of herumführt.
The police found the demonstranten, too close to the bella-zentrum heranzukommen, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either maskiert or taschenmesser mitführten.
According to dänischem law are these actions in demonstrations verboten.
Gemäß a spectator, not because he wanted to be mentioned in the klimaverhandlungen involviert, zündeten maskierte demonstranten in black clothing several sprengkörper in the vicinity of the kopenhagener hauptkanals, which is near several ministerien.
They threw them in the vicinity of the buildings, he said, and added that it began as leuchtraketen, then but of "a few large explosionen" have been followed.
In the kongresszentrums inneren gathered in front of the people fernsehbildschirmen, about the whole afternoon the demonstration.
But the protest has the awareness of the hauptfunktionäre, such as Su, chefklimaunterhändler as Chinas, apparently not.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration a konstruktive effect on the international considerations, erwiderte it in English: "This is something to which I was not even aware of."
He then drove in Mandarin Fort and said: "because of the veranstaltungsort is great, I could not hear what happens" draußen.
He said that, from the perspective of the individual abhänge, whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and of various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, we can also say that the negotiations or the freedom of other people "stören.
Prüfungsdaten show hartnäckige rassenkluft
The zeugnisse to mathematikleistung last week were willkommene positive news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the distrikt Washington still far behind the schools of the country is to unveil the zeugnisse höchstleistungen, show that the viert- and achtklässler in the last two years, faster progress than cities, the Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made einschließen.
But what, in the latest figures of the national assessment of bildungsfortschritts national assessment of educational progress (naep) eingeschlossen - is the hartnäckige leistungskluft between afroamerikanischen and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The durchschnittliche punktzahl of white viertklässler from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years of 262 to 270 (on a skala von 500), their afroamerikanischen gleichaltrigen but rose by only three points of 209 at 212.
In reality, the leistungskluft rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the achtklässler afroamerikanischen remained basically the same, he was struck by a statistisch vernachlässigbaren point of 245 at 244.
The durchschnittliche punktzahl White pupils, it was not included in the prüfdaten, since the stichprobenumfang was not big enough.
The picture on a sechsjahreszeitraum hinweg is also not ermutigender.
The gap, the white and black viertklässler trennte in 2003, when the first naep in this distrikt fraud was covered, 60 skalenpunkte (262 to 202).
And although the punktzahl, the children of both groups have achieved in this space is angewachsen, the differenz with 58 points now scarcely decreased.
Some of the bildungsbefürworter distrikts last week expressed their concern about the fact that the results of schulkanzlerin Michelle A. rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. fenty have been celebrated for the most part of white pupils, the sowieso leistungsstarke children already have been promoted.
This deutet that we the gesamtwertung through the treatment of those at the top end of the skala angehoben, which problematisch and difficult, said Jeff Smith, vorstandsmitglied of D.C. voice, a not-for-profit group which for the bildungsgleichheit in Washington D. C. entry.
I springe not for a spanne of two or three points and bills, said the democratic Washington stadtratsmitglied, Kwame R. Brown, a daughter of the eaton-grundschule class in the fourth.
Brown, a frequent critic of the managementstils of rhee, said that the message of the prüfungspunktzahlen is that the mittelschulen the city dringend need attention.
Of course we would like to see the positive signs, which I respektiere.
But what I ängstigt, is that we are not close to the time and energy aufwenden, which we need for our mittelschule einsetzen.
Rhee said the distrikt fortfahren, needs to find better ways to meet the needs of the leistungsschwachen pupils gerecht.
In this autumn, for example, it will be a few teachers geschult, a new leselehrplan, the wilson-lese-system, to use that to pupils in the upper klassen of primary school and mittelschule, what grundfähigkeiten aimed not at the beginning of the lesens their schullaufbahn gemeistert, and the signifikant behind their gleichaltrigen klassenkameraden zurückliegen.
Everyday mathematik, a lehrplan, from kindergarten up to sechsten class games and lebensechte experience in the foreground rückt, was under the former chief schulinspektor clifford janey after Washington and brought this lehrplan, some of the naep-fortschritte, the last week has been reported, zugeschrieben.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils zugutekommen, under the notenniveau, rhee said.
Others say that the naep-ergebnisse hervorheben the question whether rhee fortfahren, so can the gesamtleistung of the system and continue to improve the extra money and the ressourcen for the leistungsschwachen schools available, can the notwenig, in order to reduce the gap.
This is a ernstes dilemma for Michelle rhee, said Bruce fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, the prüfungsergebnisse städtische investigated.
The konventionelle heilmittel is his ressourcen and managementreformen to send to the schools in den ärmsten gebieten of Washington D.C..
The objective could cause political nachwirkungen against these important tagesordnungspunkt work.
The rub is, of course, as with other urban schulinspektoren that they tried, the white and black mittelschicht to consider.
Our fokus is to ensure that we build a system großartiger schools.
We must strengthen our schools in den stadtvierteln so that all families, irrespective of where they live, can be sure that their children get a hervorragende public schulbildung.
Janey, who is now schulinspektor in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to the closure of the leistungskluft consists of the traditional public school in Washington, which currently stands at 180 days to verlängern, in order to compete with the charter-schulen.
It must be the school year at nearly 200 days erhöhen, in order to have the strength to change, said janey, with its lehrergewerkschaft last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which it came as "a meilenstein" on the way to a greater increase in the next Treaty.
Hochschulausbildung for more people than zukunftsaussicht
Of the gettysburg-college reisebus achieved with a noisy pfeifen.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, is rising from and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the White säulen, the ziegelsteinfassaden and the smaragdgrünen rasens.
Gracielas eltern hardly have the highschool in El Salvador completed.
Until recently, graciela had also in silver spring was geborgen and now living in riverdale, never put a foot on a college-campus.
Your attitude and the other achtklässler the group to explore the gettysburg, where the teaching per year 38.690 dollars costs, was more of a ehrfurchtsvollen besuchers, than the one enthusiastischen zukünftigen students.
"Yes, I will be here soon, 'rief graciela, medizin, would like to study as the Führer proclaimed that they now had to enter the building naturwissenschaften.
"wow, really?" she said, as she has the nachdenklich niedrige professor-zu-studenten-verhältnis school was reported.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7. the children on their dreitägigen tour have visited and now they have the beabsichtigte message included in full: the question is not whether it's at college.
The question is, where.
On the one hand, there is a wachsende concern about the large number of children in the United States hispanischer geborenen immigrants, what the highschool not an end or as a teenager schwanger, on the other hand, however, there are also hundreds of what the collegeausbildung, which is required in order to in the mittelschicht levels.
In truth is one of five this "second generation" of the College hispanoamerikaner from – what a bemerkenswerte performance is, since many of their immigrierten eltern, mostly from Mexico or zentralamerika, in the United States, came without the highschool to have concluded.
Their erfolgsgeschichten are important, say researchers, because you for a generation, which has a huge role in the labour force in the country, will play the way after vorn.
Those who study leistungsstarke children, say that they are often a natural affinität for the school and you innewohnenden antrieb to success.
Many of you have also eltern, their children set high goals and find ways to ensure that their lack of familiarity with American schools to kompensieren.
But beratungsprogramme also play a major role by graciela and millions of children as they help in college, especially if these efforts for long periods of time fortbestehen.
If you look at einkommensschwache children whose eltern, not the experience and fertigkeiten, you have in the wegsuche through the system to help, then we will have a single measure to any time does not solve the problem, said Patricia gándara forscherin, of the University of California in Davis, the hispanoamerikanische untersuchte students.
We need to think about, for these children a unterstützendes network of the vorschule until the highschool available.
The bundesprogramm, the gracielas had college-tour finanziert, is a nützliches example.
It is known as gear up - a motion - and hochschalten represents more than 300 million dollars per year for local schulsysteme available to college-vorbereitungsprogramme to launch the start, if einkommensschwache pupils in the mittelschule and weiterlaufen, until they have completed the highschool.
The us-department gemäß for education has the programme since 1999, more than 10 million pupils, helped by more than 60% in college are gone.
Irakisches ölministerium includes contracts with 10 foreign ölgesellschaften from
Despite concerns about violence and political instabilität has the irakische government in two on Saturday to bring greater ölgesellschaften abgeschlossenen auctions, his geschädigte infrastructure back aufzubauen.
The 10 with foreign ölgesellschaften abgeschlossenen treaties of the Iraqi ölministeriums close to show that China, Russia and the European ölunternehmen are prepared, an important role in the renovierung of Iraqi ölindustrie, to play for decades by war and wirtschaftssanktionen gelähmt.
American companies have shares in only two of the 10 versteigerten felder for themselves verbuchen.
Seven American companies have had to take part in the second auction will pay, which began on Friday.
The only companies that made a gebot, has drawn the kürzeren.
Two American companies have contracts for in June versteigerte felder abschließen.
The gesäten dünn representatives of American ölmultis in the opening up of the Iraqi ölindustrie überraschte the analysts.
The Iraq war has, at long last, after 6 years his tore geöffnet and instead of us-unternehmen asiatische and give European the way, said husari ruba, the editor of Iraq oil forum, a online-nachrichtendienst.
There will be no further bids for a long time in Iraq.
Sicherheitsbedenken, even by massive koordinierte bombardements on Tuesday were unterstrichen and the political instabilität by the withdrawal of the us-militärs American ölgesellschaften probably have stopped, analysts said, is more in Iraq to engagieren, of the drittgrößten nachgewiesenen rohölreserven in the world.
In some cases, were us-firmen benachteiligt, because competitors, particularly the chinesen and other staatlich kontrollierte energieunternehmen, much less lohnkosten and have more risks, because they have no rechenschaft ablegen aktionären.
Exxon-mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies, the treaties with the Treasury abschließen.
Greater us-unternehmen, such as Chevron and conocophillips, the with the Iraqi ölministerium pflegen close relations and in the last few years with technischem Council stood to the side, are assumed leer.
The russischen company LukOil and Gazprom were the hauptakteure in two of this weekend zugesprochenen treaties.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more treaties, as irgendein different companies, and was able to with great paketen verträgen for two more felder go home.
We all know, said the spokesman for the ölministeriums, Assam Jihad that China is on the way, one of the great of the global economy, as well as a technologiemacht.
We are convinced that the Chinese companies with his mitbietern can judge and his verpflichtungen in relation to the Iraq erfüllen.
For the gebotsabgabe vorausgewählte gebote gave companies, which then gebühr per barrel of oil has been compared to the Ministry was willing to pay, the felds ausstoß each on the current level also.
Top-planer of Al kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In a offensichtlichen us-raketenangriff pakistanischen along the border with Afghanistan this week is a top-einsatzplaner of Al kaida being killed, representatives of the us-terrorismusbekämpfung reported on Friday.
This would be, if it would confirm that the second deadly attack on a senior leaders of the terrororganisation in this autumn.
Saleh al-somali was one of the two Arabs, the gemäß us-quellen and pakistanischen behördenvertretern the region of a number of raketen are to be slaughtered, their fahrzeug on Tuesday near the town of miran Shah in the provinz nord-waziristan met.
Local authorities reported that the raketen abgefeuert, by a drohnentyp were by the CIA in gesetzlosen stammesgürtel pakistans will be used.

There are suspected to be the militanten to belong to the point, rannten and quickly took everything in itself, as the "completely zerstörten körpern" was left.
The local authorities could not confirm the victims identität, but two representatives of the us-terrorismusbekämpfung unbestimmte had evidence that Somali belonged to the toten.
A Somali führender militärischer planer of Al kaida beschrieben, operationen terroristischer groups outside the region marked the afghanistan-pakistan.
He was in the whole world of verschwörungen involved, said a senior beamter, anonym, and wanted to remain on the heiklen nature of American luftangriffe pakistanischem verwies in soil.
If his central role as umfasste annimmt, given that the planning of angriffen against the United States and Europe.
He took strategische instructions from the topführern von Al kaida in and turned it into operationsplanungen terroristische for possible attacks.
The second American behördenvertreter said that Somali quickly in the al-kaida-hierarchie aufgestiegen is and best links to other extremistengruppen used in the region.
He may not be aware of some Americans, said the second behördenvertreter, but this in no way reduces the risk it for us and our verbündeten darstellte.
If confirmed, his death would be the second leading Al kaida- Somali or talibanführer, since September, was killed in a similar attack najmuddin jalolov, the Führer in stammesgebiet an militanten group and three other topaktivisten were killed.
The pace of attacks by drohnen the CIA is since the summer, gemäß a zusammenfassung of long journal, was one of a non-governmental organisation unterhaltenen website, by an average of six operationen per month to two dropped.
The decline in May on improved taktiken of terrorgruppen beruhen, the steps have their angreifbarkeit unternommen, while at the same time to reduce the suspicion stehende informanten brutal töten, reported the side.
Un-gesandter führender in Kabul will resign
The leading gesandte the UNO in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he will not resign his post in March, which would end a stormy tenure by behauptungen weitverbreitete on corruption in the of the UNO supported afghanischen präsidentenwahl getrübt.
Eides weggang erfolgt, as the obama-regierung has decided, further 30.000 us-soldaten in Afghanistan to senden.
The un-gesandte said that he supports the truppenerhöhung, but he also expressed his concerns about the us-zeitplan from that for the militärischen withdrawal, which is to begin in 18 months ago, could help other nato-regierungen veranlassen, their streitkräfte abzuziehen.
We need to speed up the construction of afghanischen security forces and thereby the richtige signal to the afghanen senden, that you can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telefoninterview from Kabul.
This commitment must be long term.
The norwegische drängte diplomat, the United States and other militärmächte also, the number of international zivilen helpers to erhöhen, with the help of political umstellung Afghanistans.
The truppenerhöhung on the militärischen side has an increase to match the zivilen side, he said.
Eide said that he will not stand down his office, but only one in March 2008 compared with his family getroffene agreement erfülle, only two years to stay in Kabul.
He said that he wanted the notifications to uno-
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon weiterleiten now, so that they have time to ensure, for a replacement.
As I have said, is that it is better to try to find a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a zweimonatiges vakuum between the weggang I vorgängers and my arrival.
Ban has gemäß un-vertretern with the search for a replacement.
The un-vertreter say that he schwedisch-italienisch-stämmigen Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the un-mission in bagdad, and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, the previously led to un-friedensoperationen has taken into consideration.
Eides position in Afghanistan has been put on the probe, after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the präsidentenwahl in the country and to bevorzugen massivem to conceal evidence of electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all the charges, but he said also that the anschuldigungen of Galbraith - gefeuert - the mission was "zweifellos have already caused damage, because a great deal of scepticism in relation to the international interference in the election was".

The un-regeln are so gestaltet that I have been a Member since May, as he said, only one person could einstellen.
This is katastrophal and must not continue.
Us-verteidigungsminister Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Verteidigungsminister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the weltmächte soon "significant additional sanctions" on the Iran impose because he will not discuss his atompläne has participated.
Gates spoke during a 7-tägigen journey through the kriegsgebiete in Afghanistan and in Iraq to a group of around 300 us-soldaten in nordirak and played the aussicht on a militäraktion islamische against the Republic of Iran herab.
In Iran are no good opportunities for choice, he said in response to the question of soldiers on the likelihood of such a development.
"one of the things that I lie on the seele, is, if we, in the last six years have learned something from the Iraq war, which has its own unvorhersagbarkeit."
The obama-regierung prefers a sanktionspaket in recital, to the military and political elite is one of the aims of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the durchschnittsiraner.
He said that a "package of positive and negativen anreizen" is required, "iranische to convince the government that they with nuklearwaffen in reality is less geschützt" because "their people" ungeheuer under the sanctions will suffer.
On Friday, in a statement from the spokesman for the White House, Robert gibbs, the American Government in the European spitzenpolitikern angeschlossen, warning that the Iran with "glaubhaften" consequences if he must reckon with his atomprogramm not the demands of uno-sicherheitsrats and his atom-überwachungsorganisation, the international atomenergiebehörde, nachkommt.
The Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nukleartechnik only for friedliche purposes should be won.
In talks in genf on 1 October said of Iran that he talks to the restriction of its atomprogramms would begin again and to a substantial part of his lagerbestands to angereichertem uran in exchange for dringend benötigten nuklearbrennstoff for his medizinischen forschungsreaktor would abandon.
The US government has insisted on this type of agreement, the trust between the two parties aufzubauen and time for negotiations.
The Iran seems since that time, however, the negotiations on the vorläufigen agreements have to leave -- the part, experts say, because the iranische uneins leadership is about whether it is compared to the United States should verpflichten.
The international community that the Iran in relation to a number of proposals, which it had already agreed at the beginning of October, simply left standing, has openly said that the international community, including the Russians and chinesen, in a way, as it zusammengebracht in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran were never, Gates said.
President Obama has dez. 31. as a deadline for the Iran festgesetzt, on these proposals, to respond before he other optionen, including those to the Foreign Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton once again, "erdrückende sanctions" called weiterverfolgen.
In a New York abgegebenen opinion has the iranische representation at the United Nations on Thursday condemned what they "grundlose and unfundierte behauptungen" of some of the sicherheitsratsmitglieder iranischen atomaktivitäten called and said that they are ready to take the talks with the United States and five other weltmächten fortzusetzen ", in order to achieve a geeignete long-term lösung".
Gates, on the last Friday after Washington should return in the morning, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister, nuri al-Maliki, before he was in the ölreiche kurdische region in Iraq to meeting with soldiers in Kirkuk and with kurdischen behördenvertretern was flying in Irbil.
The spannungen between kurden and arabischen majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, eigentumsrechte and because of the aufteilung of public revenue.
Gates drängte both sides, to reduce the konfliktpotenzial, in order to prevent the us-pläne verzögerungen, the American truppenstärke until the end of August of 115.000 at 50.
Gates also tried the kurdische concern about the bevorstehenden truppenabzug to zerstreuen. Us-vertreter quoted gates, to masud Barzani, the President of the kurdischen regionalregierung, said: "We will their security, their wealth and their autonomy within a geeinten iraks.
We will not leave you. "
The older a kursänderung werdenden China
Wang weijia and her husband wuchsen surrounded by propagandaplakaten on which you vorträge hielten that 'mother earth to müde, other children to unterhalten "and" a baby more means a grave more ".
These lektionen have learned it so well that when regierungsbeamte in Shanghai by niedrige geburtenrate and the older werdende population in this summer, suddenly began to change the course and young paare ermunterten, more than one child, her response was immediate and endgültig: "on any case".
We already have all of our time and energy invested in a child.
For a zweites baby is no longer desired, said Wang, 31, a personalleiterin with a 8-monate altem son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the ein-kind-politik in China, the two generationen von notorisch dicklichen, verzogenen einzelkindern, liebevoll "little emperor" hervorgebracht has mentioned, is a bevölkerungskrise herauf in the country.
The durchschnittliche geburtenrate is on 1,8 children per couple, compared with 6 for the time when this policy in Kraft trat, fallen, is the uno-
Department for bevölkerungsfragen, while the number of bevölkerungsgruppe of 60 years and older in the year 2020 of 16,7 per cent of the population by the year 2050 at 31,1 per cent rise explosionsartig. This is far above the global average of around 20 per cent.
This is küstenstädten ungleichgewicht in rich with gebildeter population, such as Shanghai, more.
Last year, 60-jährige and older almost 22 percent of residents identified gemeldeten shanghais, while the geburtenrate under one child per couple has gelegen.
Xie lingli, head of the shanghaier stadtbevölkerungs- and familienplanungskomission has said that paare in zeugungsfähigen age babys must have in order to help "in the relationship between the older werdenden bevölkerungsanteile and reduce the arbeitskräftemangel lindern the future".
Shanghai will soon "as old -- but not so rich -- as the industrieländer, such as Japan and schweden,," she said.
A gradual thawing
In the Constitution of the country in the year 1978 verankert, Chinas ein-kind-politik will probably be available the umstrittenste by the ruling party was introduced kommunistischen until today.
Ehepaare, against this policy, must break with enormous geldstrafen -- count up to her dreifachen jahresgehalt in some regions -- and with discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese staatsvertreter have this policy zugeschrieben, that the critical beanspruchung of natürlichen landesressourcen could be avoided, wogegen menschenrechtsvertreter missbräuche in durchsetzung condemned the policy.
In rural areas, some officials schwangere, which already had a child, forced to abzutreiben.
Many paare also had geschlechtsselektive abtreibungen, which carry out a unnatürlich hohes relationship of männern arose to women.
In the last few years have gradually regierungsvertreter for people their attitude to ein-kind-politik abgeschwächt.
In 2004, they have more exceptions to the rule -- including stadtbewohnern zugelassen, mitgliedern ethnischer minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been einzelkinder are -- and 2007 was the ton of many harter abgemildert slogans.
Qiao xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for bevölkerungsforschung of Peking university said that regierungsvertreter recently even on radikalere änderungen have discussed, for example, paaren two children to gestatten, in which one partner is einzelkind.
Shanghai was in July for the first Chinese city that an aggressive campaign to promote more geburten has launched.
Put up posters, the families belehrten, only to have a baby, were almost on night of directives, replaced the detailed, who describe for a zweites baby infrage, and how we can apply for permission.
The City Council has städtische employees and volunteers for familienplanung ausgesandt paare in order to go back home and informationsblätter under the doors durchzuschieben.
You also asked about psychological and financial beratung for available to more than one child.
The response was not particularly ermutigend, said familienplanungsvertreter.
Enttäuschende response
Although officials from a rural kleinstadt in the außenbereichen of Shanghai said that a aufschwung in den anträgen von paaren to recognise is that after the launch of the campaign want a zweites baby, the urban bezirke melden against no change.
In the municipality of huinan with a einwohnerzahl 115.000 go by, for example, still per month only four to five anträge.
Enttäuschte shanghaier officials say that the number of geburten erwartete for 2010 in the city despite the campaign still at around 165.000 -- will be slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng juying, head of the familienplanungskomitees of shanghaier caolu municipality, said that financial erwägungen are probably the main reason why many people no longer want to have children.
You want to give your first the best, she said.
Yang jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu juanjuan, 26, have said that they would like to have two children and it also allows rechtlich.
But they have, how many chinesen, only a geringfügige kranken- and life-insurance policy of the government.
Without a soziales network, they say, would be this decision unverantwortlich.
People in the West, assess the ein-kind-politik fälschlich than menschenrechtsfrage, said Yang, a bauingenieur, whose wife in siebten month with their first child schwanger.
Yes, we raubt us the possibility of more than one child.
The problem, though, is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Others give paare psychological reasons for their zögern.
Wang, the personalleiterin, said that she would only a child because it was a einzelkind. "We were the centre of the family and gewohnt that each of us has gekümmert.
We are not used to us, in order to do this and other kümmern, not really. "
Chen, a zijian 42-jähriger, a übersetzungsunternehmen, said it unverblümter.
For eltern from the small and medium-sized businesses, with doppelkarriere by the geburtenrate drops, he said, it is about to be a success and for that we must be egoistisch.
Today the altersgruppe 20- bis 39-jährigen wuchsen so that on their eltern, during the early days of the Chinese kapitalismusexperiments fight and they want to see as a life for themselves in, he said.
Also a einzelnes child, he said, makes huge demands on the time the eltern.
A mother, her soziales life at least give up for two years.
Then there are the raumfrage -- "we need his housing umbauen" -- and the lebensplanung -- "if a child is 9 months old, we must have a CV for the best vorschulen doctrine."
Most of his friends are prepared to do this, a time durchzumachen, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to a higher lebensstandard has achieved, he said.
We do not want too many victims.
Uno-gruppe entwirft plan to emissionsreduzierung
The by the UNO geförderte klimakonferenz -- which until now by Wilde posen and gegenseitige accusations auszeichnete -- has on Friday with the publication of a dokuments again set a focus for the next 40 years of a ehrgeizige senkung treibhausgase aufzeichnet, while the industrienationen Nahen in the future, the largest lasten shoulders.
The text, which is the basis for a endgültiges political agreement on the regulation of treibhausgase could liefern, has both the verbleibenden aufgewiesen obstacles, as well as the way to vorn.
But it was an important step forward in a verhandlung, considered the time next week, as more than 100 spitzenpolitiker from all the world in kopenhagen ankommen.
The text, which is in favour of a eigens geschaffenen un-arbeitsgruppe was formulated, schweigt over the geldmenge from, the rich countries to the Armen countries should be so that these kurz- and long-term global erwärmung meistern.
He also offers a palette of optionen for the schlüsselfragen, including how industrie- and big emerging economies can restrict their kohlenstoffausstoß and how high the upper grenzwert of global temperaturanstiegs should be the political entscheidungsträger mittragen.
The process will be a great flexibilität luminaries, as John coequyt, senior representatives of the Sierra clubs in Washington.
Michael Zammit cutajar, of the sechsseitige dokument, has drafted a 180 pages long verhandlungstext zusammengefasst, in order to put this in the centre, which is the leading klimaschutzvertreter the UNO, yvo de Boer, as "the great whole" has described.
It shows the grundriss of a possible agreement, in which the industrienationen together their emissionen until 2020 to 25 to 45 per cent, compared with the grenzwerten of 1990, would reduce, while larger entwicklungsländer their emissionen in the same period by 15 to 30 percent would reduce.
Together the countries could the emissionen bis 2050 about 50 to 95 per cent cut.
The European Community has the talks on Friday also awarded a auftrieb through their zusicherung, over the next three years hinweg 3.6 billion dollars per year bereitzustellen, in order to support ärmere countries, the effects of climate change - by adapting the überschwemmungen meistern and dürren until the avoidance of entwaldung.
By Friday, however, the same verbalen feuerwerke, what the talks in the last week had intended.
The American klimasonderbeauftragte Todd star formulierungen, has rejected the verbindliche senkungen of treibhausgasemissionen for industrieländer, compared with voluntary reduzierungen for major emerging economies, demand this, if not of the industrienationen finanziert.
This train kündigte in that the obama-regierung a härtere line drives with China, as a representative of the Bush administration, not even two years ago.
The United States will be no agreement unterzeichnen, without major emerging economies aufstehen and take action, also on the star, klagte, that the text does not go far enough, to ensure that the senkungen also außenstehenden could be confirmed.
Star gave his opinion one hour after the declaration of the Chinese vizeaußenministers he yafei, the besagte, that it is the leading American klimaunterhändler either to "vernunft" mangele or it "highly unverantwortlich" of him was that, at the beginning of the week, he said that the United States would help China not financially, the global erwärmung to meistern.
As a result, that the future economic marschrichtung of large weltmächte at stake is, both within the industrienationen, as well as between the industrienationen and den schwellenländern bruchlinien aufgetan.
The current fight bezieht is equally to the rescue of individual ökonomien, as well as on the saving of the planet, with China and the United States are simply because of their relevant verpflichtungen befehden, while ärmere countries claim that the two dutzend einflussreichsten countries the scientific ignorieren, mutigere would need to take action.
Ricardo ulate from Costa Rica, a delegierter, said that it was not surprising that the major mächte fight about who the costs for the bremsung of treibhausgasausstoßes should bear, because even betroffene countries that are moved, aggressive this vorzugehen, the countries with very hoher treibhausgasabgabe for their deeds rechenschaft to draw on.
This is clearly a game, which is a new economic vorherrschaft will develop, so ulate, also as regionaler klimawandelberater for conservation international in Mexico and mittelamerika tätig.
Some of the countries, the effects of climate change are the most exposed, admitted that they remain a rechtlich bindenden Treaty in kopenhagen would fight, although the leading participants say that the discussions, in the best case, lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of small inselstaaten with 43 mitgliedern on early freitagmorgen presented a 24-seitigen vertragsentwurf.
Artur runge-metzger, of the international klimaverhandlungen leitet for the European Commission, has said that the offensive of the small inselstaaten "political pressure on the entire political process ausübt," in part because they are now vereint and measures of the schwellenländern, such as China and India, are calling for.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegierten konzentrierten based on the fact that most offenen issues before the arrival of the regierungsführer must be clarified, in order to come to an agreement.
High-level representatives, as the indische umweltminister jairam ramesh and the Chinese vizeminister entstiegen their aircraft and rasten through the gänge to meetings of the bella-centers behind verschlossenen doors and pressekonferenzen, abzustecken claims during the next week will be negotiated.
The sheer scale of the Assembly -- 13.000 people go in and out of a daily kongresszentrum, gitarrespielende activists hold nächtliche shows where you are on the countries make fun, betrayed and sell their opinion, and vertragsentwürfe from hand to hand rather than via e-mail weitergereicht -- already represents a challenge.
The intensität baut is only just in: almost all of the important ministers are now here on Wednesday and will be 60 regierungsführer in kopenhagen.
We come to oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for global policy of the organisation of conservation international.
The schwergewichte.
Großbritanniens first 225 km / h faster train defined the montagsgefühl newly
About 5 p.m., Monday morning 13 will be a pfeife the dunkelheit durchdringen, a zugabfahrt anzukündigen, a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first hochgeschwindigkeitspendlerzug in the country will be at his blitzfahrt of ashfort, Kent, after London St. pancras 225 km / h and reach 93 km in 38 minutes zurücklegen.
To Lord adonis, the verkehrsminister, will then lady Kelly Holmes aboard the first javelin-pendlerservices from London begeben.
He hofft, that the new service in Britain schlussendlich a internationales schienennetz zuverlässiger ankoppeln faster, trains and the great ballungsgebiete the Midlands, the North and schottlands anbinden in London.
The vernachlässigte provinz could become lebendigen pendlerstädten, would be arbeitsanfahrtszeiten Radikal and reduced the wechsel by plane and car to Bahn would the national kohlenstoffemissionen and congestion on the roads vermindern.
In theory, believe the three major parties to this vision.
But the many billions of pounds for the construction of a new national schienennetzes are needed, the unvermeidbare planungsschlacht and fears about umweltschäden could in the British hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen still draw the bremse.
High speed two (hs2), a in January gegründetes companies, which the government is a durchführbarkeitsstudie vorlegen, Lord adonis, according to the times of presenting the report on 30 December.
As a result he receives a detaillierte streckenkarte the next planned stufe of hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetzes.
The new bahnlinie, the London with the West Midlands, will combine with a spielraum of five metres of urban areas and into places vorbeiführen, where the effects on the environment are controversial.
The free site will the plan the concept within a abstands from 25 metres of the final stretch aufzeigen.
Hs2 is also three optionen for a larger, nordwärts führendes hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetz erstellen.
Lord adonis will react to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a y-förmige streckenführung, in which an individual hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecke lead in the West Midlands.
The route would in itself or in the vicinity of Birmingham and would share a abzweig westlich the pennines to Manchester and Scotland and lead another towards nordosten after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the most viable option," said a eisenbahn-insider.
After the fertigstellung would the reisezeit between London and Edinburgh to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first teilstrecke, before 2025 would not be opened, it would allow the travellers, the route london-birmingham in 49 Minutes today, compared with a little over an hour, zurückzulegen.
The entwürfe böten trains the possibility, with a speed of 400 km / h, which the British schienennetz the schnellste of Europe.
The first stretch was planned so that 400 metres long trains with a maximalkapazität of 1.100 people to be able to travel.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be on the line london-birmingham in operation.
This, in turn, would mean that in London a endstation would be necessary, on the 20 000 passengers per hour could be abgefertigt.
In view of the räumlichen restrictions in the capital is expected to make a bestehender ausgebaut station would be the hochgeschwindigkeitsnetz unterzubringen.
Bahnexperten say that only St. pancras international or euston this potential.
Lord adonis will be known whether this plan in his opinion, should be fortgeführt or not, but the langwierigen public beratungs- and planungsmaßnahmen mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he puts the räder in movement, must be built in the schienennetz abschnitten.
The first trains should the hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecken on bestehende schienenstrecken in the north of Birmingham wechseln, making the reisezeit between London and Scotland continues to lie about three hours.
This is a crucial knackpunkt, so that a wechsel from the plane to Bahn can be ensured, a richtmaß for the schienenrevolution.

The parteienbündnis by François Bayrou ’ s Party modem is monitored, on Friday on a übernahmeversuch the siegels, once of Valéry Giscard d ’ Estaing ’ gegründeten party, the party of the vorsitzenden vonseiten Nouveau centre, Hervé Morin, heftig responded and him under the threat of persecution gerichtlichen aufgefordert, this Siegel dokument on any more.
Hervé Morin kündigt publicly his intention to take this udf-siegel because he is of the opinion that François Bayrou würdig would not, this political heritage, having to defend the left hand gereicht.
The verteidigungsminister, whose parteipartner the UMP is, in fact, wanted this strategie on Saturday before the Nationalrat the NC to bekräftigen.
The emphasis of his work, he had the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (ehemalig UMP, now in NC), of a claim to the trademark eigentum UDF erhebt, because he was the first to this brand of 2004 at the "Institute national de la propriété industrielle" beantragt.
However, the geschäftstelle broke the of François bayrous' s freunden überwachte parteienbündnisses UDF the schweigen and gave it to understand that they are not enteignen left and got the ministers and the Members under the threat of persecution gerichtlichen a deadline this Siegel, no longer use the brand and the eigentumsrechte.
They have in the last few days that they made many erklärungen their political movement vorschlagen, would take over the udf-siegelzu + +, the parteienbündnis wrote in a, from 19 of the 24 büromitglieder unterzeichneten letter, including François Bayrou and Marielle De Sarnez, the party modem and the Senator Jean arthuis of zentristischen bündnisses.
It is also believed that they had the right to the name of this movement Nouveau + + + Centre, of the slogans of today's UDF +, in their political material and on its website abdrucken startseite.
As you know, they have no anrecht on the use of this siegels, said the geschäftsstelle the UDF and calls for the party in NC, "unverzüglich the UDF erwähnung of the name of sämtlichem material and of (ITS) website" to remove.
In addition, we demanded by Hervé de Charette, "the eigentumsrechte the brand to transfer to their legal anspruchsberechtigen".

In their letter they betonen, that "UDF since 1978 vollwertige" a political movement, and remember that Morin and his friends' the choice they have made "in 2007, in order to leave a konkurrierende movement, as others have already done in 2002, the UMP party" to "reasons.
The Party has therefore Nouveau centre, according to the unterzeichnenden, no rights, the udf-siegel (Union pour La démocratie française).
They also point out that the last congress the UDF 2007 the dreijährigen beitritt to party modem and the creation of a geschäftsstelle to defend "the material and moralischen interests" of Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing gegründeten movement that has passed.

He profitiert on skandalöse and betrügerische way, by the lack of hinterlegung of akronyms UDF, in order for this for themselves.
They continue to be concern that this recklessness in the best way is to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategie the NC: "It seems to us but in politics, as in life, würdevoller to make a name for themselves, rather than to try, from the anonymität, one by one, on behalf aneignet betrügerische way, on the one rechtsansprüche has no".

The 62-jährige photographer, who is known for his starfotos, will focus on 15. and 16 April 2010 ausbeutung because of weakness in court must verantworten, a criminal offence, with a maximum sentence of three years and one geldstrafe von 375.000 euro geahndet.
This decision means that there is in fact a process in this affaire will give to the saga of the reichsten frankreichs würdig families in which the mother and daughter and at the same time the zügel fetzen of kosmetikimperiums l 'oréal in the hand.
However, the same ordnete 15. criminal division a medical examination of the 87-jährigen liliane bettencourt, which will be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The erbin and hauptaktionärin L ’ oréal 'has so far refused to such an investigation into unterziehen, especially among the, during the investigation of the public prosecutor of Nanterre vorgelegten conditions.
The doctors are ernannten on Friday before the 10 March 2010 vorlegen, a report in which it clearly be known whether and to what times liliane bettencourt is in a state of weakness have found.
I think that you will these investigations unterziehen.
I shall speak with her, said the lawyer of Mrs bettencourt, me Georges kiejman, after the verhandlung.
What the lawyer of Françoise bettencourt-meyers me, Olivier metzner anbelangt, it is with the decision of the Court is very satisfied.
This is an excellent piece of news (...). The gutachten will prove that he (banier) this old lady has manipulated, which we must protect, he gave.
For two years, the only daughter of liliane bettencourt strafrechtliche françois-marie banier complaint against a photographer, and allroundkünstler initiated, and it accused the weakness of their mother ausgenutzt for years to have schenkungen themselves by a total of one billion euros in the form of bankschecks, or to versicherungspolicen gemälden erschleichen.
Ihrerseits liliane bettencourt, had always been refuted by the photographers had been manipulated to be you as a langjährigen friend.
Although the Court of the zulässigkeit of Mrs bettencourt-meyers eingeleiteten complaint should examine, the plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large familiendebakel.

Since its heirat Françoise, I have never been more talk ".
The public prosecutor ’ s office in Nanterre, once again, is of the opinion that the klägerin had no right to react, and, above all, because a vormundschaftsrichter in recent days has rejected their request, a gerichtliches schutzverfahren against their mother.
Liliane bettencourt "is fully rechtsfähig, is not under protection and has no vormund.
No one has the right to act in their place, "the public prosecutor's office confirmed the vertreterin, marie-christine daubigney.
The Court has now entschlossen, a urteil, after the process to zulässigkeit von Mme bettencourt-meyers has taken place.
Manager-revolution or the end of the strategic frühaufklärung?
If there is no change in the leadership of the great französisch businesses, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence have been umsonst...
Since about a jahrzehnt, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumer in the marketing-revolution: it is for the staff beitreten "values" certainly the best, as it was earlier in the consumer-produkte von den technikern in work to impose gestaltet.
By giving the customers in the heart of the company, the marketing-revolution the strategien eroberung of the markets have been on the ground... although the autoritäre temptation products getrennt faktoren preferences of customers to impose regularly again!
A demobilisierung of staff can lead to a fatal demoralisierung.
The selbstmorde in France Telecom Renault, PSA, or are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, especially the employees berührt.
This demobilisierung is having an adverse effect on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular to those of F & eund, which is still crucial to those of economic intelligence.
In fact, calls for the ie (intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "from all interested parties (...) a proaktives approach and a zukunftsorientierte vision"; it is demanding of the staff, a commitment to the instructions of the autoritären managements completely contradictory.
That is why we are calling for a betriebliche revolution, it would be, the staff of the concerns of the company in denmittelpunkt gleichberechtigt alongside the customers to posts.
Use the very bedingte interner meinungsumfragen
Will the internen meinungsumfragen, as the fragebogen, the Orange his lohnempfängern has made this revolution in relation to the management-praxis anregen?
I befürchte, unfortunately not.
- firstly, because I could see that the whole gefüge faced with a new situation for many umwegen, finally, that it anlangt vorrangig... to do what it always has done.
Also because the autoritarismus - one of the pathologien the macht- proportional to the importance of its own misserfolge zunimmt.
And finally, because most führungskräfte vereinfachte a strong vision of human behaviour.
Hervorgegangen from the big ingenieurschulen is your interpretation of the psychology mechanistisch.
They take on the old behavioristische by intellectuals komfort theory, the recently by the U.S. "and" neurowissenschaften reaktiviert unwissentlich weitreichend of forschungsinstituten and disseminated by the media.
And, therefore, by suggeriert, that it is possible, the "hebel" (sic) on the involvement of employees to betätigen bestärkt, a aktuellein Le figaro.fr erschienene umfrage by ipsos the führungskräfte in a position to a mechanistischen steuerungssystem for heutige world ungeeignet.
The mobilisierungsfaktoren identifizieren and measure
Instead, one for the reibungslose functioning of modern companies necessary betriebliche revolution the adoption of a final view of human behaviour advance.
It is, in any überlegung or practice of steuerung to integrate a fundamental protokoll: for the lohnempfänger is the commitment of the company will be possible only if it clearly appears as a means to a part of your träume, their ehrgeizes and their projects.
At the moment only take the studies from the multifunktionellen analysis of these konzeption motivierung of staff.
These studies have shown that they do it on the basis of a vorgegebenen doxa beurteilen, you through your wahrgenommenes picture of the company, abzuschätzen, which allows them to offer their lebensziele verwirklichung.
Thanks to the identifikation and messung this mobilisierungsfaktoren can the führungskräfte of their companies' social achievement "check forecasts and vorwegnehmen and their human ressource management back to the right post platzieren.
So they create a fruchtbaren soil, for the development of a robusten effizienten abgestimmte and economic intelligence is favourable.

We need to stop the terrorists down there, it says.
Obama, the two kriege of his vorgänger, George W. Bush has geerbt, the kriege in Iraq and in Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo, the use of violence to rechtfertigen; a way, his entscheidungvon nine days to explain 30.000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan to entsenden.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, vertrat, the opinion of the präsdent in Oslo have "very good work" geleistet.
I thought that really was the speech very well, frohlockte, the former President of the House of Representatives, especially the verweis on "the existence of the bösen in the world," in the words of Obamas anerkannte.
In some parts habeich this speech very and even perceived as historisch, said ginrich, in the radiosendung "the takeaway" has been questioned.
The bisherige Members by some as a possible candidate for the Republican presidential election nominierung in 2012 will be considered, said that he was a "erfreut Presidents of the left" to have seen, of the members of the nobel-komitees reminded them that they were "not free and a price for the peace could not aushändigen, if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael gerson, the former schreiber of George W. Bush and is now editor of the Washington Post, when Obama has "a very American speech delivered".
In addition to that, "he kosmopolit", such as "he always power", as he has "an American president" when he spoke to the europäer hinwies, "as in a sicherheitsblase lives that they themselves did not create and for their protection they do not do so much," gerson.
Among the few, not überzeugten rights, described the former uno-botschafter John Bolton, a falke the Bush era, the speech on the website of the national review online as "langweilig, hochtrabend and inspirationslos".
To the left of the President is the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama this fall on the streitkräfte verteidigt.
Verpackt the war under the deckmantel of justice, can the massaker in den unschuldigen simply rechtfertigen, he warns.
The press is, however, still left the gemäßigten lobend at the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the opinion that the nobelpreis verfrüht to Obama was vergeben, described the speech itself for a redner as him, for his talent, is known as a "monumentalwerk".
The speech in Oslo "offers a ablaufplan to steuerung of international decisions against the conflicts, the poverty and repression", as the daily Californian enthusiastically.
The New York Times is of the view that Obama "the necessary diskurs" and announced his speech referred to as a "düster beispielhaft" and at the same time.

After a dreiwöchigen verhandlungsmarathon came the gewerkschaften of straßenverbandes and the tlf - the only arbeitgeberorganisation until the end, which remained on freitagabend - to reach an agreement, the streikbefehl and the threat of serious versorgungsengpass weihnachten puts an end to it.
In the unterschriftssitzung on freitagabend "welcomed" the for the transportation of competent staatssekretär Dominique bussereau, the agreement on mittwochmorgen after several verhandlungswochen was launched.
After a second verhandlungsnacht trennten the verhandelnden on early freitagmorgen in the hope that the agreement on late vormittag rasch to unterzeichnen.
And this despite the fact that the three arbeitgeberverbände (fntr, unostra and otre) the zusammenkunft aufgebracht had left.
However it vergingen more than six hours of the start of the zusammenkunft about 11: 00 p.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and only about 18: 00 p.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict "the companies would have been very much damage inflicted on" and "it was to be feared that the feiertage at the end of the year would beeinträchtigen", so bussereau.
The agreement provides for a lohnsteigerung about 4% for the lowest wages (local and regionaler straßentransport) and 2.9% for the highest lohngruppen (International transporte).
The stundensatz for arbeitnehmer with the lowest löhnen so increases of 8,72 euros on 9,06 euro.
"This is not very much, but we are starting to start small, patrice Clos (fo).
The activists are now angewiesen, not to block the versorgungszentren more.
"but there will probably always be some widerspenstige who are not satisfied with the agreement", ergänzt it.
The tlf-vorsitzende Philippe grillot spoke of a "good deal", although it was "difficult to these lohnsteigerungen, in the face of international competition" einzuräumen.
According to him, the increase in 170 euro monatlich for low and 100 to 120 euros for the high lohngruppen.
"this agreement is based on the gesundem menschenverstand and respect towards the beschäftigten", so maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry douine (cftc) of "a historic agreement" spoke.
Richard jaubert (CGT) spoke in this regard on "a akzeptablen compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase of reisekosten about 3%, as well as the aufrechthaltung of gesamtetats for the straßentransport in the first half of 2010, which will enable it, in particular, the issue of 13. monatsgehalt and the modernisation of the tarifverträge anzugehen.
M. bussereau pointed out that "the fall of the abgaben for employers in the sum of EUR 100 million" subject for a änderungsantrag of government on the berichtigten gesetzentwurf finances for 2009 was that on the night of Thursday on Friday by the nationalversammlung was adopted.
The government calls "a identische" by the Senate vote.
The unterschrift of tlf allows it, that the agreement for the first of this organisation angeschlossenen companies, and that they then in the case of a ausdehnung through the arbeitsminister for the entire berufsstand applies.
"in kürzester time this will be the case," bussereau assured.
The opposition of the arbeitgeberverbände can only hinauszögern procedures.
The Federation fntr has denounced a "fraudulent Handel", because the 100 million euro "were the sector to compensate for a part of the kohlenstoffsteuer has already been promised".
The staatssekretär for transport zwang, schnellstmöglich us to negotiate, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the gans-esser in den nahenden weihnachtstagen not to verdrießen, the unostra beklagt.
For the association of otre threatens the agreement "the small and mittleren companies of the industry in the next 12 months, a great tomb to schaufeln".

New silicon-valley
Galt long years as a secret city, for westliche visitors unzugänglich.
Selenograd, one of ten bezirken capital of Moscow, was in the sowjetunion a strictly bewachter standort for secret rüstungsforschung.
Today is the kommune with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres away from moskauer centre, as "russisches Silicon Valley".
Significant forschungs- and produktionsstätten for mikro- nanoelektronik here and there.
Since September 2008 representatives had selenograds kontakte geknüpft to Frankfurt wissenschaftsstandort riedberg - with the uniinstituten and the firms of the Frankfurter innovationszentrums (fiz).
There have been several gegenseitige besuche and now selenograd signed on Wednesday and riedberg in Frankfurt on a "protokoll engeren cooperation".
The moskauer vize-bürgermeister Yuri rosljak and präfekt Anatoly Smirnov selenograd resulted from the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt unterschrieb planungsdezernent Edwin black.
Representatives of the fiz be 2010 and small and mittlerer companies of naturwissenschaftlichen foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after selenograd travel.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
The fiz allows companies will, on the growing russischen market to take root.
Umgekehrt want Russian wissenschaftsfirmen aufträge in Germany ergattern.
Selenograd is the seat important russischer forschungsinstitute and -unternehmen.
These include, for example, the Institute for elektronentechnik moskauer, the great konzerne sitronics and rosssijskaja elektronika.

Stuttgarter bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not high enough ansetzen.
For the advocates of the project, it is purely and simply to "the new heart of Europe".
Quite so. S21 is much more than the tieferlegen a bahnhofs, more than a monströses bauvorhaben, the city of baden-württembergischen landeshauptstadt for a jahrzehnt in heilloses baustellenchaos will plunge.
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the mid-1980s, was born.
Kopfbahnhöfe with gleisen who end up in the middle of the city, at the time of the fossilien galten as verkehrstechnische 19. century, as bremsklötze of a modern schienenverkehrs wirkten, since it once very much time, brauchte lokomotiven von back umzuspannen forward.
Einfahren, briefly, go further - so can ´ s.
And that is why the kopfbahnhöfe should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a durchfahrtsbahnhof, for example in the transeuropäischen schienen-magistrale halber route between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - is therefore the slogan of "heart of Europe".
S21 will now actually angegangen, although the visionen long since the 1980s years no longer with the reality kompatibel.
Even very ambitionierte planer have realised that it in the hessischen and bayrischen großstadt almost unbezahlbar is implemented, the tieferlegen.
However, kopfbahnhöfe have also not a one- and ausfahrtsproblem more, since it modern wendezüge with triebfahrzeugen and steuerwagen at both ends.
Nevertheless, the ice-neubaustrecke: Stuttgart 21 nebst after Ulm will now angegangen.
Landes- and kommunalpolitiker have durchgesetzt.
The Bahn power with, and also because the risks of the largest infrastruktur-einzelprojekts the Republic of taxpayers and not the staatskonzern.
Städtebaulich is the project still einigermaßen rechtfertigen.
It will create new stadtraum, which - if we are to believe the computergenerierten grafiken of planer, equipped with much grün.
For the verkehrssystem schiene is s21 schädlich.
The durchgangsbahnhof and the streckenausbau are intended for the personenverkehr, the one - typically 1980s years - riesiges growth zuschrieb.
At that time there was no competition of billigflieger.
Moderner verkehrspolitik, it must first, however, is to strengthen the güterverkehr because of transport on the schiene considerably umweltfreundlicher than by lorries on the roads.
But the neubaustrecke taugt because of intense steigungen not for güterzüge.
That is still much gravierender s21 also indirectly many other bahnprojekte tangiert.
Good six billion euros in schwäbischen should be verbuddelt.
This is the official number.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion for realistisch.
It is a fact that, in the next jahrzehnt will the money to other knotenpunkten and engstellen in the network.
A total of sechzig larger projects are on the list of verkehrsministeriums.
The most important is the ausbau eins of good 180 kilometres long stretch through the rheintal.
Since 1987, it calls on the trasse built in zeitlupentempo.
Dringend would be needed, right here on the tube to drücken.
But s21 than bremsklotz wirken.
Will the rheintalstrecke to flaschenhals for the international güterverkehr: midway in the heart of Europe.
Government prüft urteil for airport
The provincial government has in wiesbadener landtag left open whether you against the urteil of hessischen verwaltungsgerichtshofs (vgh) to nachtflugverbot in revision will go.
The CDU / fdp-koalition have asked experts to the more than 400 pages vgh-urteil umfassende juristisch to examine, said wirtschaftsminister Dieter posch (FDP).
The vgh in Kassel had on these days schriftlich explained that the country in the event of the baus of the planned nordwest-landebahn in Frankfurt airport nachtflugverbot should the new rules.
The authorisation of 17 flügen between 23 and 5 p.m., as it provides for the provincial government, is not with the gesetzlich gebotenen protection of the population against nächtlichem fluglärm to vereinbaren.
The coalition needs 4. until January to decide whether you against the urteil in revision.
The opposition criticised this aufschub drang and to the representatives of the government, on a revision to abandon the bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig.
Spd-fraktionschef torsten schäfer-gümbel CDU, FDP and asked to return to her before the election gemachten promises to return a nachtflugverbot. Andernfalls, this is as "wortbruch" werten.
It is verdammt difficult if you must keep his word, said grünen-chef Tarek al-wazir in an allusion to the fdp-wahlslogan "we keep word".
Minister posch was the vorwurf of schäfer-gümbel back, the provincial government attempts to "rechtsverdreherei and trickserei" but still to come to their nachtflügen.
A precise juristische prüfung need your time.
The coalition wants not on the basis of a "schnellen first impression" operieren.
We need a rechtssichere entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
So, as the opposition darstelle, whether the statements of his group to nachtflugverbot never has been.
Us-banken figures Hilfen back
The krisengeschüttelten us-großbanken strip of their state shackles.
The Bank of America has the Hilfen on Wednesday from the bankenrettungsfonds TARP amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars (good 30 billion euros) at a stroke back.

The Institute will thus get rid of beschränkungen, with the adoption of the money einhergegangen are – such as the begrenzung in the payment of managerboni and the entrichtung hoher charges.
The Bank of America was on wandelanleihen well 19 billion dollar frisches money for investors concerned.
The rest of the amount they took from their own coffers, inter alia, by spartenverkäufe was well gefüllt.
Bankchef Kenneth Lewis mittwochabend ausdrücklich bedankte itself on the American taxpayer, the geldspritze voted on a very schwierige time helped.
The geldhaus was the culmination of the financial crisis, with the adoption of the investmentbank Merrill Lynch verhoben.
The Citigroup wants to befreiung from their verbindlichkeiten towards the State also raise money on kapitalmarkt.
On Thursday the us-bank could have a around 20 billion dollar heavy aufstockung announcing their capital, cnbc reported, citing kreise.
A citigroup-sprecher did not express itself.
In June, Goldman Sachs had already, JP Morgan chase and Morgan Stanley repaid their Hilfen.
Rapid election
It was then, but everything is faster than thought.
Barely two weeks after the zdf-verwaltungsrat den amtierenden chefredakteur nikolaus brender from the office had pushed the channel can present a successor.
Last night the Gremium wanted to vote on the personalie.
As favorit galt Peter Frey, the head of the zdf-hauptstadtstudios in Berlin.
There was a confirmation by the channel but not in favour - offiziell, the procedure is not vorzugreifen.
However, may also have played a role, the zdf-intendanten Markus schächter not to further damage, this proposal should also not be on the board.
Frey, schächters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 gremiummitglieder.
The result of the vote in redaktionsschluss this edition was not yet clear.
Two weeks ago, was schächter with his proposal, the Treaty with nikolaus brender for a further five years, in the management board failed to verlängern.
Only seven Members spoke for brender, seven votierten against him. Brenders abwahl was a herbe defeat for a erwartbare schächter, however.
The unionsmehrheit because the Board had already weeks before the election signalisiert, brender not in office to confirm.
Had organised the protest against the chefredakteur of hessische Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument, brender under the nachrichtensendungen of ZDF to einschaltquoten lost another term in office, he rejected the hochangesehenen chefredakteurs.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore proteste in which the political einflussnahme gegeißelt on ZDF.
Least had 35 staatsrechtler even in the debate eingemischt, the action as eingeschätzten kochs verfassungswidrig.
It has not worked.
The person
Peter Frey on 4. was born in August 1957 bingen.
He studied politics, and romanistik pädagogik.
He later worked at the südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 wechselte Frey on ZDF, firstly, the "heute-journal".
Anschließende stationen: 1988 until 1990 persönlicher referent of chefredakteurs; 1991 / 92 Korrespondent in Washington; until 1998 head and Moderator of "morgenmagazins"; by 2001, head of the zdf-außenpolitik; since then, head of the zdf-hauptstadtstudios.
The Greens withdrew after the abwahl brenders, on Wednesday by still branchenblatt medium magazine, the journalist of the year was chosen, a verfassungsklage.
Kochs widerpart on board rheinland-pfälzische Kurt Beck, the Prime Minister, said last week that the countries should change the zdf-staatsvertrag so that personalvorschläge of intendanten not by a politically motivierte majority can be blocked.
A auszug of parteipolitikern from the aufsichtsgremien of ZDF castle also Beck, however.
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey, the board with a klugen stratagem, he recommended by the Gremium immediately after the brender-abwahl heftig criticised for it.
Thanks to this belegs journalistischer independence could both schächter him without gesichtsverlust for the Posten of chefredakteurs nominieren, as well as the board to choose without in the suspicion, a parteigänger into the office to hieven.
In the parteiarithmetik ohnehin Frey is the linksliberalen zugerechnet.
Will studium entrümpelt
For the students teilerfolg: after a year of bildungsstreiks lenkten the kultusminister of countries at last: a on Thursday at a meeting of kultusminister- and hochschulrektorenkonferenz einigten, both sides are the studienbedingungen in bachelor and master of wanting to improve.
The students should in future be able to have their studium also bewältigen.
It is in the individual verständigten, to reduce the prüfungsbelastungen: grundsätzlich each studienmodul should only with a single prüfung abschließen.
In addition to the arbeitsbelastung reviewed the studierenden and "a realistisches and vertretbares level" gewährleistet.
Politics and hochschulen also want the recognition of prüfungsleistungen between hochschulen within and outside Germany vereinfachen.
The countries committed themselves to common strukturvorgaben for bachelor- and masterstudiengänge flexibler to gestalten.
It länderregelungen abweichende should also not be there.
Less prüfungen
Since the beginning of the studentenproteste in June and uni-rektoren kultusminister bear the geflügelte word of the better studierbarkeit in the mouth.
Now it was the first time with a specific content gefüllt.
The akkreditierungsrat sogenannte decided that the number of prüfungen in part to reduce drastisch: "every modul includes, usually with just a prüfung from", it said in a 30-seiten-papier, the authorisation of studiengängen partly to new rules.
With the "clear verringerung of prüfungslast", said the akkreditierungsrat-vorsitzende Reinhold Grimm, a "fehlentwicklung einhalt should be offered the studierbarkeit beeinträchtigte significantly."
In addition to the "studierbarkeit" in the future, "the decisive kriterium" in the gestaltung.
Module as content are "strictly daraufhin" to check whether "unnecessary einengungen the studierenden in the choice of
Veranstaltungen "would be avoided.
The students' claim, spielräume, and allow the eigeninitiative fördern ".
The rules are to apply to the authorisation of new, but also in the review bestehender studiengänge.
This must all five years' reakkreditiert "– which means that it takes until 2015, until all studiengänge were reviewed.
Bundesweit are responsible for ten akkreditierungsagenturen which of the countries akkreditierungsrat eingerichteten unterstehen.
The kultusminister had the countries in October "with emphasis" aufgefordert, so the agenturen einzuwirken that the stofffülle not too big and not to the prüfungsregime strictly.
In individual Länder, universities and fachhochschulen with the landesministerien already on appropriate measures verständigt.
As has been said in this country einziges Rhineland for the further development of the bologna-prozesses additional resources.
Of the money the hochschulen should, above all, tutorenprogramme and set up studienberatung and prüfungs- and auslandsämter strengths.
Hochschulen want for this country and ten million euro aufwenden.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants a revision of the hochschulgesetzes submit to Parliament.
After this is for the conclusion of a studienmodells only a single prüfung be necessary.
The studiengestaltung flexibler should, moreover, is the recognition of leistungsnachweisen to other hochschulen gewährleistet and access easier to master.
By the end of next year all of the country should studiengänge on their studierbarkeit be reviewed.
Government and opposition had again on Thursday on the studienbedingungen gestritten in the country.
In addition to lob but there was also criticism of the beschlüssen.
Of the juso-hochschulgruppen bundesvorstand called the gestaltung the bildungspolitik should not in future more "behind verschlossenen doors" of the Minister and hochschulrektoren take place.
Spätestens after the bildungsstreiks should now also the studierenden mitreden wörtchen betroffene "than a".
The future akademiker support received by the President of the hochschulrektorenkonferenz (hrk), margret wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said Thursday during a meeting with the kultusministern with which the hrk on a common reformpapier beriet.
The gewerkschaft erziehung and Wissenschaft (gew) went the Bonner decisions as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a rechtsanspruch, each with a bachelor-abschluss absolventen the access to a weiterführenden masterstudiengang believing.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that for the generation of bachelor-studierenden heutige tomorrow with sufficient masterstudienplätze bestmöglichen studienbedingungen are available, so gew-vorstandsmitglied Andreas Keller.
The countries must clearly more dozenten einstellen.
A freieren access to master the kultusminister not mentioned, however.
More than a fußnote to herta Müller
In Germany and comment from is beautiful, almost no control... "is the anfangszeile a gedichts of lyrikers Werner söllner in which this in the ankunftserfahrung verstörenden sprachfetzen a dissidenten thematisiert, freedom won, but at the same time, has lost its sprachraum.
The 1951 in Romanian banat geborene Werner söllner had first and than deutsch- englischlehrer in bukarest and later as lektor worked in a kinderbuchverlag before he 1982 after Frankfurt on main übersiedelte.
Söllner is with diversen literaturpreisen has been excellent, in 1993, he was the legendary Frankfurter poetikvorlesungen in the goethe-universität, and since 2002, he is head of the hessischen literaturforums in mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For außerliterarisches erhebliches aufsehen he brought on last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, when it comes to "German literature in rumänien in the mirror and zerrspiegel their securitateakten".
Sichtlich verunsichert and verlegen verlas söllner a statement in which he rumäniendeutschen schriftstellerkollegen u.a., Richard Wagner, William totok, Franz hodjak, and Helmuth frauendorfer, his mitarbeit than for the Romanian geheimdienst Securitate eingestand.
Together with some of those present had söllner 1989 the German sprachpreis.
The anwerbungsversuche schleichend had begun, first in 1971.
I am, therefore, söllner Castle, "someone who is not enough against einschüchterungsversuche the Securitate gewehrt."
The lyriker Werner söllner is Walter.
Almost at the same time, with the nobelpreisehrung for herta Müller and whose beispiellose literarische auseinandersetzung with the mechanisms diktatorischer will rule the literaturszene and, in particular, the Community of from rumänien stammenden German authors, shaken by a case of the abgründe and niedertracht of a political system that makes kenntlich on überwachung and bespitzelung gründet.
Werner söllner is, as far as we can tell after bisherigem kenntnisstand, not only criminals, but also victims.
In his securitate-akte have played a role in the Walter, said after the confession of söllners literaturwissenschaftler Michael Markel verwies for him and to the positive einflussnahme of in Walter.
He had it all for him at the time diffizilen points "herausgehauen", so Markel.
It was a moralisches need him, this comment to make.
Söllners statement was in form and in this audience unexpectedly, completely surprising is the bekenntnis of a previous dissidenten and its cooperation with the Romanian geheimdienst but not.
Germany is a gemütliches reservat for securitate-spitzel, had already been herta Müller in July at the time, having written their own akte, 914 sides, had read.
The affected, we must assume, spekuliert in manchem case and will probably also have klarname gewusst, which is behind the decknamen sorin, voicu and also verbarg Walter.
Other than the here at home now very verfahrenssicheren sichtung of stasi-akten is the umgang with the hinterlassenschaften the securitate-überwachung still very diffus.
A systematische information is in recent years and has been hintertrieben behindert.
One of the birthler-behörde appropriate national Council on the securitate-akten aufarbeitung (cnsas) was founded in 1999, until the publication of the files verlief seither schleppend instead.
Only since 2005, there is a law, which the administration of the files.
That the influence of former securitate-mitglieder in rumänien still is very large, belegte after the bekanntgabe of nobelpreises herta Müller for an interview in which a former securitate-chef from temesvar abfällig on preisträgerin said.
They have a psychose, finally, we have only once interrogated.
The infamie of power said is quite unverhohlen in the shape of the meinungsfreiheit able to express an opinion.
Certainly in the case söllner knüpfen, as so often in connection with verschwiegener fault, unvermeidliche issues.
Why only now? who was geschadet? The besonnene reaction of zuhörenden on söllners bekenntnis gives hope that the continuation of this kapitels of wissensdrang rather than schuldzuweisung and scham will be determined.
To genese the werks of herta Müller, the nobelpreis entgegengenommen yesterday, it is more than a fußnote.
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League
It would be just as wirkte, as a adrett gekleideter außendienstler of a very netten weihnachtsfeier, on which a sportartikelhersteller goodies had distributed, as the new vfb-trainer Christian gross in begleitung a orangefarbenen plastiktüte of ausrüsters a viertelstunde after midnight in a herbeigerufene c-klasse rose ¨.
The man with the markanten glatze dragged him because the city chauffieren even strangers.
Otherwise, he would have also can even drive - alcohol was not, after all, in the game, and before the 55-jährige besoffen luck was just as little.
Was a angenehmer been tomorrow evening, but the work is continuing.
Or just right away.
In the words of the only three days before schweizers themselves: "We have achieved, although the achtelfinale", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3: 1-erfolgs against unirea urziceni in rumänien, "us but we must not allow the success of blenden: it will be a brutal harter fight against the abstieg."
The "much wichtigere task" stehe on Sunday before.
Then there is the königsklassen-leistung in Mainz, in liga-alltag to repeat.
And the well offenbarten schwächen again after the schnellen three gates by marica (5.), träsch (8) and pogrebnyak (11) abzustellen.
Auslosung
The achtelfinale the Champions League (hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23. / 24 February / rückspiele 9. / 10 + 16 / 17 March) will be on 18. December in nyon ausgelost.
The joy on the fulminanten einstand of babbel-nachfolgers remained so behaviour.
Not only the vermeintlichen heilsbringer, of the verunsicherten stuttgarter profis in the short time selbstvertrauen, einsatzbereitschaft and spielfreude had given.
I am on the spieler zugegangen and you have said that you are to your strengths besinnen, and they have to be angehalten, mutiger, said seelenklempner gross it so easy klingende erfolgsrezept, which under therapeut babbel but more gezeitigt had no effect.
He has a certain magie entfacht, babbel-befürworter Jens lehmann was, 'If in a new impuls fußball, passieren sometimes things which we would have not kept for possible. "
And Sami khedira, after wochenlanger verletzungspause thanks to its dynamism, immediately to the best spieler in the place avancierte, tried the festgestellte "phenomenon" with the sprichwörtlichen "fresh air" and the workings of the new vorgesetzten describe: "He is a man who calls durchgreift and discipline.
That is what we need in the momentanen situation. "
It is under babbel had apparently gemangelt.
The vfb Stuttgart is not yet on the Berg, warns sportvorstand Horst heldt
The vfb Stuttgart needs but, above all, konstanz.
How gross hüteten is because spieler and managers before that, the victory against a ersatzgeschwächte and completely überforderte confronting the Romanian guests überzubewerten.
They have also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0: 4 evil erwachen, khedira had come to mind.
And sportvorstand Horst heldt mahnte that although a saisonziel has been achieved, the other but still in more distant.
We are not yet on the Berg.
On his birthday that heldt 40. themselves after the first heimsieg for three months after zumute was not celebrate, was to the events of the weekend, in the form of a directly above spielbeginn ausgestrahlten fernseh-interviews von torhüter Jens lehmann auflebten Frisch.
There are decisions that other meetings and not the Jens, konterte heldt the lehmanns harsche criticism.
The Board asked the führungsschwäche accused and shown to the trainerwechsel to pressure pubertierender fans entschlossen.
Also, his freier day after play had been deleted, wertete lehmann as a sign of fehlender sovereignty and missgunst.
Lehmanns statements were "of purem egoismus" geprägt, keilte heldt back and kündigte consequences for the schlussmann.
I do not think they will be friends for life more, the two vierzigjährigen.
But they were, after all, with all the other is einig, that without the vorarbeiten through the abgelöste trainerteam the spielerisch kämpferisch strong idea and would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistenten would have "a major part of the success," said heldt and lehmann unisono - and also the man with the plastiktüte agreed to.
In schwergewicht wm-fight
Hitziges duel in Bern: always provozierte herausforderer Kevin Johnson weltmeister vitali klitschko with words and gesten.
But after 12 runden fiercely defended the ukrainer his schwergewichts-titel after version of the wbc.
The urteil fell from the punktrichter einstimmig.
Hamburg - vitali klitschko box-weltmeister remains in schwergewicht.
The 38-jährige champion after version of the association wbc besiegte in the night Saturday in Bern the Americans Kevin Johnson einstimmig after points (120: 108, 119, 120, 108, 109).
For klitschko, it was the third successful titelverteidigung after his comeback in October 2008.
Before the ukrainer was already weltmeister twice the verbände wbo and wbc.
Unfortunately, it has with the k.o., all have expected, not geklappt.
Klitschko baute his record on 39 siege in 41 profi-kämpfen, twice he had reason to be beaten by verletzungen.
Herausforderer Johnson had to fight the first defeat in 24. hinnehmen.
Before around 17.000 spectators in the arena of 2,02 berner wanted to the fight, klitschko metres high, especially with his left führungshand diktieren.
The eleven zentimeter kleinere Johnson, of the duel before the end of the klitschko-ära entzog had announced, but always the schlägen of weltmeisters, so that klitschko his gefährliche rights not to bring crucial goal.
A total of passive Johnson did too little for a herausforderer and attempted only on the runden.
Although he provozierte klitschko with words and gesten, his schläge met the weltmeister but only rarely.
After all, it is only the second Boxer after Timo hoffmann in the year 2000, with klitschko on volle distance of 12 runden is gone.
The herausforderer had before the fight in the Schweizer capital for some commotion gesorgt.
He beleidigte klitschko hässlichen as a "Zombie", the "not true".
The wiegen, then the champion on Friday to the sonnenbrille provozieren, Johnson of the nase to schubsen, "in order to be able to see his eyes."
Vierter klitschkos comeback victory after
Klitschko also remained in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008 siegreich.
After almost vierjähriger auszeit he had at the time, the nigerianer Samuel Peter in Berlin and beaten "his" wbc-gürtel zurückgeholt he kampflos had previously made.
This year, he then bezwang in his titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez from kuba and Chris arreola in September from the United States.
I have in this fight only one fell swoop körperlich abbekommen and am very well in form, klitschko had the rapid rückkehr in the ring.
His dream remains, but the unification of all four major titles in the family.
Brother wladimir, the verbände ibf and wbo weltmeister.
Den gürtel the wba but does the Brite David haye, after this in November the 2,13 metres great Nikolai walujew entthronen.
Haye had in the summer before a scheduled for September fight against vitali klitschko abgesagt.
The promotiongesellschaft allegedly planning now already the fight against klitschko wembleystadion in London.
Case kunduz
Frontalangriff from the opposition: grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin, verteidigungsminister guttenberg because false information to kunduz-affäre described as lügner.
SPD and left demanding information from the kanzlerin.
Hamburg / Berlin - after the recent erkenntnissen to luftangriff of kunduz, the opposition verteidigungsminister karl-theodor to guttenberg (CSU) a bewusste täuschung unterstellt.
The Minister said the deadly bombardement on two tanklastzüge dated September "wissentlich the unwahrheit" said grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin, said on Saturday in the ard-nachrichtensendung "Tagesschau".
One: he has the landläufig nennt gelogen.
The orders to töten missachtung is under the rules of the international schutztruppe in Afghanistan (ISAF) erteilt.
This is the substance of the report, the NATO had to read Mr guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was known that the attack is not only a zerstörung the entführten laster, but also about to two talibanführer gezielt töten.
In the German kunduz-kommandeur oberst small angeforderten us-luftangriff, according to nato-untersuchungsbericht were up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
SPD, grüne and left on Saturday called bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU), before the Bundestag umgehend to speak and also to clarify what guttenberg really about the incident gewusst.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategie of gezielten tötens afghanistan-politik is part of the government - and whether Bundeswehr nachrichtendienst kanzleramt, and these new strategie gebilligt, Jürgen Trittin and have called for grünen-kollegin Renate Künast.
Regierungssprecher Ulrich Wilhelm, strongly back the criticism.
The kanzleramt have not on konkrete operations of the Bundeswehr influence in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, also had doubts about the presentation of the Ministry on the background to the dismissal of generalinspekteur Wolfgang schneiderhan and staatssekretär Peter wichert loudly.
According to information received by the mirror, the two guttenberg korrekt and fully informed about the background of the tanklaster-anschlags.
Offiziell had it geheißen, you would have the existence of the nato-berichte geleugnet and the Minister sensible details.
In the context of the two spitzenbeamten verlautete, however, that the Ministry of Defence on a number of reports have even hingewiesen, including a zweiseitiges dokument of befehlhabenden oberst small and a feldjägerbericht.
Wichert is now in a letter to the sachverhalts klarstellung asked, have reported the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
A response he received to date have not, it says.
The Ministry said on Saturday not to the vorwürfen and verwies point that this will be resolved in the bundestages untersuchungsausschuss, on next Wednesday konstituieren wants.
Traumwelten
Some see in wachem state images and voices heard, the other not see or hear.
Not only in psychisch sick and in the drogenrausch verschwimmen the boundaries between reality and imagination.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is in order.
If we with geschlossenen eyes in our dark zimmern, we must have the wildesten ungehemmt ideas and phantasiegebilden hingeben.
But anyone in the wachsein traumartige conditions, sees and hears seen things, the other not see or hear applies in the modern Western world mostly as verrückt drogensüchtig, or at least as sonderling.
But such images and voices emerge not only in psychisch sick or in the drogenrausch.
Blame our vorstellungskraft: has the same neuronalen prozesse, which enable us to design houses, images to malen or romane, mitunter letter to ensure that the boundaries between dream and reality, wahn verschwimmen.
Traumartig veränderte wachbewusstseinszustände can occur in den unterschiedlichsten forms, in the best case we call them, in the worst case wahn visionen.
Even if auslöser and effect may differ, the visionen the mystikerin hildegard of bingen, the drogenerlebnisse of new-age-propheten Carlos castaneda, schamanische entrückungszustände, psychosen and halluzinationen but on similar prozesse zurückführen.
Halluzinationen wahnvorstellungen or, if that is the neuronalen gleichgewicht botenstoffe of the brain - above all dopamin, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholin entgleist interaktion - and the various gehirnteile is disrupted.
Complex halluzinationen and wahnhafte ideas are very often during a schizophrenen psychose.
The force of gravity - both has no power over him more
The context of wahn and dream, philosopher and mediziner employed since the antike.
Aristoteles halluzinationen concept as a form of dream in wachen state, Wilhelm griesinger begründer, one of the modern psychiatrie konstatierte 1861, a "great similarity of the irreseins with traumzuständen" for Sigmund Freud, which was the dream of a "psychose, even with all the ungereimtheiten, wahnbildungen, sinnestäuschungen of such".
It is autumn 2001, when Henning T. turned into a comicfigur.
His body is zweidimensional and quietschbunt.
The force of gravity - both has no power more about him, he of the zimmerdecke schwebt.
He enters a spürt.
Behind him, geflügelte teufelsgestalten with blutroten verzerrten fratzen, zähnefletschend.
They enter jagen him, him with serious, flammenden stiefeln, let him against the walls, he spürt the pain on the whole body.
Noisy, bösartige dröhnen vote from walls and radio.
He can no longer ertragen, the voices, the him and beleidigen beschimpfen.
Henning T., formerly from the two kabel stereoanlage, knotet schlinge and lead it to you on a vehicle in the decke haken.
He is rising at a loudspeakers and sets the schlinge in den hals.
Bounces.
The schlinge löst itself.
This should you be a lehre schreien, the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem chorus, "geh in the clinic and lass heilen you!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, he has seen six akute psychosen, the final is 2 years back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnose is schizoaffektive-paranoide psychose, it is also manisch-depressiv, he takes medication to combat the depression, the manie, the schizophrenie.
He has learned to live with his disease, for three years, he got married.
In the psychose schlimmste fear I have seen and tiefste verzweiflung, he says.
The trugbilder grausame reality are
Approximately one per cent of the population gets at least once in the lives of schizophrenie psychiatrischen kliniken, will you as zweithäufigste illness after the depression.
In an emergency schizophrenen psychose betroffene usually can no longer distinguish between innen- and außenwelt, you end up in a übererregten state, which, größen- halluzinationen, beziehungs- or verfolgungswahn can lead.
This is particularly prevalent stimmenhören - votes, the befehlen, or dialogisieren kommentieren.
Also optische halluzinationen are not rare.
The betroffene is capable of unwichtigem more important not to separate the brain can no longer ausfiltern störende signals, the awareness of eindrücken überschwemmt.
As the dream also opens the psychose the schleusen for a flood of ideas and phantasien, the root bewusstseinsschichten entstammen.
The realitätswahrnehmung in the psychose is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, oberarzt the clinic for general psychiatrie universitätsklinikum in Heidelberg.
The schizophrene is located in the centre of the geschehens, everything has a gerichtete importance to him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, similar to the dream of the geschehnissen überwältigt and you can not actively gestalten.
Schizophrene therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A realitätsabgleich you usually is not possible, the trugbilder grausame are waking up to reality.
Even in life to have seen a halluzination
Other than in the dream, "says Fuchs, but remains the sinnliche and räumliche struktur of reality in the psychose wahrgenommen, grundsätzlich."
The wahnhaften thoughts and halluzinationen fußen in reality, which will take place in the erlebens verfremdung realen framework.
Why exactly our brains kapriolen proposes, researchers are still in mystery.
Ausnahmezustände can lead to any people that he loses the realitätsbezug kurzzeitig Fuchs, says.
But not everyone will develop a psychose.
It appears to be a genetic veranlagung schizophrenie, but zwillingsstudien have shown that the gene, not the bestimmenden faktoren alone.
Researchers assume that in affected minimale hirnschäden are available.
We assume that the neuronale reifung in the brain in an early stadium of the development will be disrupted by a viruserkrankung mother during the schwangerschaft for example, erläutert Fuchs.
But it bleibe a mystery, as the disruption of the neuronalen system, which furthermore is reached first on many years does not manifestiere.
Umwelteinflüsse also play a role, stress or traumatische erlebnisse auslöser can be for a psychose, if there is the disposition.
Also halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychosen, since they are in the transmittersystem eingreifen.
If our brain is hotly
That is, psychotiker verrückte suffering under their halluzinationen and schlucken teure medicines to loszuwerden, others give money for drugs in order to get what is, says the lübecker psychologieprofessor Erich kasten.
Whether trugbilder or perceived as angenehm unangenehm, is often just a question of standpunkts.
Kasten sammelt for ten years and trugerscheinungen reports on halluzinationen, last year, he has his results in the book "the irreale world in our head" ausgewertet.
Although halluzinationen belong to the typical begleiterscheinungen von psychosen erstaunlich, but also of many other illnesses.
These include, in addition to psychischen störungen as borderline or depression often diseases such as migräne, epilepsie, multiple sklerose or Alzheimer and schädelhirntraumata.
Überraschenderweise halluziniert under certain conditions, even the brain gesunder people.
Halluzinationen, from gedächtnisinhalten kasten, put together, the normally zurückgehalten.
They arise when hirnareale, in which sinneswahrnehmungen verarbeitet, überaktiv or too little gehemmt; if our brains are running hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this situation as well as hirnschäden or a psychose.
But it also reizentzug, stress, liebeskummer or other mental ausnahmezustände.
In recent studies were up to a third of the befragten, at least once a halluzination in life to have seen.
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, you wohnt in a kleinstadt in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern visited and where the gymnasium.
A very normales girls, actually.
If there were not the images and voices.
In the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger young with long, dark hair it anspricht.
If he does, it is surprising to see the mitschüler - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They believe the schüchterne girls for a tagträumerin versponnene, but Sarah K. not dreams that you know.
It is wach, you hear and see these boys, just as the girls in the Bank in addition to hear and see.
You can even feel his presence, at least for augenblicke.
A angenehmes feeling is that you may be the young.
I am verrückt? asks you sometimes.
But you know, of course, that of this boy and the other trugbilder are not real, and disappear again.
At night the phenomena are mostly beängstigend
The trugbilder are often also a burden.
If you are sitting in the schoolroom before, can you not follow the unterrichtsstoff sometimes because of teachers in their eyes and ears just a new mitschüler vorstellt, while it for all other hör- and visible on the blackboard mathematische gleichungen erläutert.
At night the phenomena are mostly beängstigend.
If you are in your dark room to sleep, the waiting far too infrequently and much too late, it can often not distinguish wach, whether it is already dreaming or whether the images that you see the fratzen, or the girl with the blutenden schnittwunden in Armen and beinen, before their offenen or geschlossenen eyes.
Lasst me calmly, schreit the gestalten.
Eltern and freunden tells you nothing, which would you keep for verrückt.
The autumn of 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
It has in the past year, insisted the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the halluzinationen aufgehört.
Since you on the Internet to contact the psychologen kasten has included, you know very well, that it is not verrückt.
Wahn is also a kunstwerk from verzweiflung
If someone is sozial isoliert or under reizentzug leidet, did it with great likelihood of weile halluzinationen, says kasten.
I vermute, the brain is unterbeschäftigt themselves and then cares for its entertainment.
Sarah K., a einzelkind, had as little girls fear of other children, they often played alone.
As they began their halluzinationen, with 13 learned that the man they Papa nennt, since you can think of, not their leiblicher father.
As with visual and akustischen halluzinationen the same hirnbereiche are active, which is also real eindrücke and geräusche fällt process, it affected how Sarah K., trugbilder and difficult to distinguish reality. "every experience," says kasten, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Halluzinationen are also images to the brain, and therefore they can create wirken so real. "
Also traumbilder nächtliche assesses kasten as a form of halluzination.
The halluzinationen of gesunden not differ substantially from those of an acute psychose.
Unlike schizophrenen psychisch are healthy in the situation, as irreal to recognise their trugbilder.
Kasten advises his patients halluzinationen, therefore, also as a special ability wertzuschätzen.
Grenzzustand between dream and halluzination
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten world imaginäres unfortunately will see mostly pathologisiert, says Michael schmidt-degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and chefarzt the clinic for psychiatrie and psychotherapie of florence-nightingale-krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychose is a serious, leidvolle disease, but they also birgt positives, kreatives wahn - is also a kunstwerk from verzweiflung.
Schmidt-degenhard has the sogenannte oneiroide erlebnisform erforscht, a special form of traumartig modified wachbewusstseins.
Are oneiroide hochkomplexe, detaillierte quasi-träume, the erlebende for real, and they also, in retrospect, not by the wachzustand can distinguish.
The oneiroide bewusstseinszustand arises in trauma- or krankheitsbedingten extremsituationen, for example in polyradikulitis-patienten, in full awareness of a motorische lähmung experience.
If a person of selbst- and weltverlust is under threat, for example, by anhaltende völlige bewegungsunfähigkeit, he replaced the lebensbedrohliche realsituation through a separate, imaginäre world, the reality is schmidt-degenhard entkoppelt, says.
A kind of grenzzustand between dream and halluzination.
Since the bewältigung a situation in the reality is not possible, will take a weltwechsel, the realsituation but in the imagination vergegenwärtigt.
An intensive form of sinnstiftung and sinngebung unerträglichen itself in a situation in which people own gestaltungsfähigkeit allows us, not in a nothing of the bewusstseinsverlustes unterzugehen.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Even the Zürcher kunsthistoriker Peter Cornelius claussen describes his oneiroid-erlebnisse in his book "herzwechsel" as an operation to rescue the seele.
He is 49 years old, when his consciousness after a herzklappenoperation with anschließender herztransplantation tagelang begibt on travel, while his body on the intensivstation to bewegungslosigkeit is convicted.
Claussen taucht a in a selbstgeschaffene world, visiting foreign times and places: he is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, boarded a zugsanatoriums, a roboter wacht about his health.
He lives in the early mittelalter under adligen, the rauschmittel from blood herstellen.
Will a griechen in the motorrad in its own country, surft verschleppt with his spitalbett in firnschnee the Alps and hits a koreanischen Mafioso.
He is completely on the imaginierten, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inneren travel for claussen differ radically from any dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
Quite the contrary, I have the memories from mentalen travel and even after years in nebensächlichen überdeutlich details.
Even clearer and more than erlebtes really.
The intensität this erlebens sprengt the horizont our sonstigen lebensweltlichen experience, says the schmidt-degenhard psychiater.
Last oneiroide endes show, psychosen halluzinationen, and drogenrausch brüchig, as our inneren abbilder äußeren reality of the wachen.
Any change in the bewusstseinszustandes, resümiert the psychologist kasten, "can lead to a verformung of what we call reality."
An experience, which is also bereichernd can be.
The schneeeinbruch can come
Burda
Should children play with 27 years the publishing company
The new verlagschef kallen is a zwischenlösung: long term Hubert burda companies want to be in the hands of his two children, he told the mirror.
The holding is also in future to 100 per cent of the family.
Hamburg - the verleger Hubert burda, companies in the long term, be in the hands of his children.
Both children erben with 27 years and have the festen willen, into companies einzutreten, said the 69-jährige the mirror.
The details that we have regulated vorsorglich.
The question of whether they are also active in the business, is only afterwards.
The question of whether you are capable of.
It is not his children vorsetzen 7500 staff if they are not sufficiently befähigt.
This brings the children and also to the company.
Burda bekanntgegeben had on Thursday that he is from January of vorstandsvorsitz zurückzieht, and paul-bernhard kallen appointed to his successor.
The 52-jährige kallen since 1999 vorstandsmitglied in burda.
First of all, he was responsible for technology.
Later came the area with responsibility for the Treasury to unternehmensvermögen and after the ausscheiden von Jürgen todenhöfer also for direktmarketing, abroad, pressure and finances.
For the first time, it is not at the top of the verlages familienmitglied.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The benennung of kallen diene also on "10, 15 years", so burda überbrücken.
The holding, should, in the future too, to 100 percent part of the family, said burda.
With regard to the cases and schickedanz schaeffler burda, said that even before the untergang familienunternehmen not sure: "the betraf always families who were of a kapitalsucht anstecken who have completely verspekuliert dachten, and they could for very large player aufsteigen.
That was never my strategie.
He had "never weltmachtträume wird", so burda.
I see myself as the political präzeptor this country, as it was Springer, and I am not even in the weltliga with 'time' mitspielen, these shops are too great.
The versprechungen of fonpeek
Peek is äuβerst limitiert, a device with which we only can read his e-mails, without an opportunity to be able to see some anhänge or durchs Internet surfing.
It has its five minutes of fame, the magazine enjoyed when it was time to one of the products of the year wählte.
At the straβe to see is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is, nonetheless, especially for young people of interest.
Unlike the smartphones peek costs very little and has a very günstige flatrate, for example, only half of the flatrate preises an iPhone.
After the success of the company that has seen, it has two new equipment placed on the market: eins, the only for Twitter is intended, the other with a lebenslangen gratisservice for data, quite unlike the peek, in which a sechsmal higher price must pay.
Fonpeek that yesterday in the veranstaltung Le web was presented, is the European version of this erfindung and, therefore, their third version.
It has the same borders, as his amerikanisches gegenstück has, however, were a surprise.
The unterhaltspreis monatliche on the telephone, approximately 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who, with a smartphone to travel the world, already know what it means to have to abandon all the data, in order to be able to read his emails, once the landesgrenze überfahren, or if you verzweifelt after a café with WiFi addiction (or a verbindungsmöglichkeit with fon).
The idea of the roamings with flatrate is incredibly verführerisch and should in fact be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telefonanbieter already specific contracts and prices for auslandsaufenthalte anbieten, but my experience after you need a doktortitel in physics and a good glasses in order to be able to read all the kleingedruckte.
The repeated criticism on the part of the European Commission in relation to erschwingliche roamingtarife for the whole of Europe remained almost always unappreciated.
Auβerhalb of their own country, we always fear before his emails, and the right to read.
That a small device as fonpeek (although it but always erstaunlich is that it has the name of fon, although it has no WiFi / wlan) this kind of tarifen anbieten, means that the telefonanbieter slowly but surely umdenken start, and have several options to take into account, as you can your datennetz einsetzen.
Kindle is another good example of this, in its prices is the downloaden of books and other anfragen contained in the Internet.
Without vetrag and without haken.
It is a internetfähiges device and one zahlt for only a einziges time, namely the purchase, and not month to month.
And that is exactly what it is, which is something I also one day of fonpeek erwarte, a kaufmöglichkeit with lebenslangem internetzugang as it already offers peek in the United States.
And this is not because I want to buy.
I read my emails with the telephone, danke.
But I erwarte this, because I am of the opinion that it is a passenderes model for the consumer would be.
It would be interesting, but a computer with the same system to be able to see.
The fetischfarbe of Michelle
Gelb is without doubt the lieblingsfarbe of the American First Lady.
The amtsantritt von Barack Obama already as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress size and a cloak this farbe and has the same farbe elected him again, when he, without doubt, a moment in his life zweitwichtigsten begleiten: the award of the friedensnobelpreises in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has in two anlässen borne very similar modelle: auβer that it was almost the same farbe - a glänzendes grüngelb - that was the clothes from three parts - clothing, jacke and mantle from the same stoff-, and this has helped a little groβförmig gesticktes or a halskette.
It is even as far as that, at first sight the anschein was that the first lady of the United States of the vorbild prinzessin of Asturias wanted to follow and decided that selbe clothing in more than just one reason to wear.
Although the two kleider but very much in the stoffart, from which they are gefertigt.
In the amtseinführung was wearing a dress size from head and one from gemusterten samt in Oslo.
Also the accessoires verschieden were: the first time grüne schuhe with halbhohen absätzen and the second time in a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
Also the frisur was different: the hair every time they were on this occasion, as haarkranz hochgesteckt in vorherigen has helped open the hair.
75% of mothers have berufstätigen because of their mutterschaft problems in getting the work.
The discrimination in the work has, in recent years, zugenommen, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of csic in cooperation with the Institute for women durchgeführte study "fruchtbarkeit and career of women in Spain".
The umfrage under 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of berufstätigen women see their karrierechancen on the labour market due to their mutterschaft eingeschränkt.
The study is openly that it groβe differences when the decision to start a family, and the number of children there, ever since, whether or not the women work and if so, what kind of work you ausüben.
Those of you who auβerhalb of the House any other activity verrichten, only halbtags work or no festen arbeitsvertrag, will have more mothers and have more children.
In contrast, the women postpone with a festen anstellung, especially in the public sector, the creation of a family and mutterschaft and therefore also have fewer children.
"The women in the altersgruppe between 35 and 49 years ago with a festen anstellung their first child receive an average of only 3.7 years after the zusammenziehen, a number based on 4,1 years for women with fester anstellung erhöht, the longer gebraucht, to achieve this and it zusammenziehen and the first child verwirklicht until much later.
Auβerdem also has the kind of influence on the work of a groβen mutterschaft, if even less than the kalender regarding the empfängnisbereitschaft ", said the csic-forscherin Margarita Delgado.
The bildungsniveau is another factor, the age of the women in the heirat and the first child must be taken into account.
According to umfrage is the age at the time of the heirat and the first child, the higher the bildungsniveau ever higher.
This difference was in the same alters women to be found.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, ever since, if you only the hauptschulabschluss or a higher education have, on average, each with 25,1 or 32,1 mother for the first time.
In addition, there are still, depending on your bildungsniveau, another difference between women.
While the women with hauptschlussabschluss before their first festanstellung heiraten and their first child, make it the women with a mittleren schulabschluss high or very different look around and just a festanstellung and heiraten afterwards and then get their first child, Delgado said.

On Albert Camus read: "in its pages, I found out that the mittelmeer no Meer, but rather a spiritueller, almost sinnlicher queues, just as I have ever seen, without words for it to have found: the pleasure unlike unheilvollen fate, the morality without fault and the unschuld without irgendeinen God".
On Samuel Beckett: "nihilist, allegorischer Christ, he wrote of what he was, not in the blood in his Verstand, had, between ohnmacht unwissenheit and, with a umwerfenden poetischen humour, without any sense of how the messerklinge that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene was: "our man of this woman with a passion, the thirteen years andauerte, dermaβen in their Bann, drawn in their meat the emotions on the grounds of adultery with the pleasure of reue united, a spirituelles privileg, that it was in the sky at the umweg of verderbens to come."
On James Joyce: "the Odysseus' 1922 in Paris was issued by Sylvia beach. It is one of the 8000er summit in the world literature, it must be in the hinaufklettern nordwand in the wall, at the time and again on the new best bergsteiger try."
On William Faulkner, "was a komischer kauz.
He said sometimes on themselves, the legacy of a gutsbesitzers that he would back the grafschaft and other times, he said that he was the son of a black and a krokodils would be.

This he made during a trip to the he flüchtete themselves and with a speech full of violence before the würmern the nachwelt anflehte.

On Joseph Conrad: "on his tomb is this verse of Spencer eingraviert: 'The sleep after the effort, / after the storm of port, / the calm after the war, / after a satten lives we will have fallen on death."
On Virginia Wolf: "in her gepäck had it in their depression.
The husband took it with völliger normalität out if you told him that Eduard VII you between the azaleen ausspionierte or the vögel on griechisch sangen.
There is not a single other case, where the man known soviel geduld aufbrachte and in a neurotikerin love, whose literarischen talent was still much gröβer than their verrücktheit. "
On baroja pío: "What was martín-santos because otherwise, than to try to einzuflößen Joyce in baroja?
What beabsichtigte because he baroja benet, if not in the arms of heranführte Faulkner?
What drew cela because, apart from the glory that man to vernichten so that they themselves can make to this podest? "
Feige aggression
My mother was 70-jährige last week by our stadtteil in the ortschaft fuenlabrada spazieren, when suddenly, a group of young people between 15 and 18 years alongside their and our hund herliefen, our hund is a mischling that we have obtained from the tierheim and time of just six kilos of wiegt, and then from heiterem sky verpassten you two fußtritte him and wounded him so hard.
Our indignation, can we not take in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, because as the spass in a cheap agression against a small and hilfloses animal is, of course, be it in the leine ausgeführt.
This is still the erstickungsanfall, a woman who was gemütlich spazieren, bekam, as these people because of the vorfalls zurechtweisen, you wanted to make your own life even fürchtete, because if so a wahnsinniger a hund attackiert, he will perhaps also the selbe with a woman, a child and an elderly Mr or probably even with each, the weaker themselves as he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet stadtviertel nachmittags by five p.m. in a quite ordinary Tuesday.
The hund has long geheult throughout the day.
We have, of course, in a nahgelegenen police anzeige erstattet, however, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything at all and etwaigen vorurteilen vorzubeugen from the outset, we would only klarstellen, that the feigen verbrecher Spaniards.
Our indignation about the geschehene gave us this veranlasst, this incident anzuzeigen.
We cannot understand what in the minds of the young people that they must act, a cheap attack on a hilfloses animal find amusing, to an animal that we love, society and freundschaft.
We do not know where the good erziehung and respect for the animals and the people are.
Michelin and fesvial together for the benutzung of Helms
The reifenhersteller Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish foundation for traffic safety (fesvial) a campaign for the promotion of the helmgebrauchs, especially among the younger motorcyclists into life gerufen, as both companies bekanntgaben today.
This initiative so that wants to draw attention to the importance of the helmgebrauchs, since it is ultimately the only schutzelement, the kopfverletzungen or even the death in the event of a motorradunfalls can prevent.
Michelin said, pointing out that this campaign part of your verpflichtung in relation to the road safety, "covers the far more than just the design and herstellen of produkten, with each day always safe" and reiterated that it with other actions pädagogischen and informativen nature of this beitragen, this objective every day to move a step closer.
This new campaign to promote the helmgebrauchs on the motorrad, under the slogan "to be or not to be" expires, in a first phase of about 500 motorradwerkstätten distribute posters, in order to achieve the bestmöglichste spread.
Michelin said the conclusion that the road safety "a permanent sorge" of the company, and that is precisely the reason, since it is a manufacturer of tyres for cars to see zwei-rädige always verpflichtet, that one of its hauptziele the development of ever sichereren produkten.
The sale of kleinlastwagen something to rise again.
After almost two years of automarkt kleintransporter finally starts for a little light at the end of the dark tunnels.
The 9.425 vehicles in November in Spain were zugelassen, mean an increase of 12,6% in relation to the year 2008, and, what is even more important is that they are so that the first zuwachs even after 22 aufeinanderfolgenden months with stetigem decline, gemäβ the from the herstellerverband anfac and the autohändlerverband ganvam vorgestellten figures.
However, these good figures are currently only with groβer caution to genieβen, since the comparison herangezogenen referenzdaten by November 2008, this is a particularly bad verkausjahr with a decrease of about 60% on the previous year.
This, however, we must remember that, quite apart from the rise in the last month, the gesamtzulassungen this 11 months still 40% below the verkaufszahlen of vorherigen geschäftsjahres.
Since January, as a whole, 95.853 vehicles sold in this number, but all vehicles, from which the kleintransportermarkt contain abkömmlinge: there is, of personenkraftwagen, pick-ups, kleintransporter, small lieferwagen and leichtere kleinlastwagen / fahrgestelle.
Desweiteren are still the same in the sky gewitterwolken, what the demand in mitleidenschaft most, because even if some of the vehicles to be bought by privatpersonen, is the groβteil of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, in almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a drittfinanzierung buyers.
So it must be for these restrictions, which are the consequence of the zugedrehten geldhahns of kreditinstitute, are still further with einschlieβen faktoren, such as the increase in the arbeitslosenrate or the bad wirtschaftslage andauern.
In this panorama and, unlike the personenkraftwagen, have the financial unterstützungen with the purchase of a fahrzeugs of the plan 2000e little help.
This plan is, however, not only for privatpersonen, also selbständige and small businesses that have a right, if you are a kleintransporter until 3,5 tonnen with a co2-ausstoss, not 160 gramm pro gefahrenen kilometres übersteigen may want to buy, but the low verkaufszahlen speak for themselves.
Just yesterday ganvam had to point out once again that it is on the part of the state is needed, including a special augenmerk on these kleinlaster and also, of course, to the industriefahrzeuge (lastkraftwagen and autobusse) to direct.
The autohändlervereinigung prophezeit for the year 2010, with a similar year, just like the last, for which it with a verkaufsausfall (in personenkraftwagen and geländewagen) by 19% is calculated.
The support in bremsmanövern in kritischen situationen is now duty
As was already the antiblockierbremssystem ABS and as it is now with the stabilitätskontrolle ESP happens, the hilfssysteme need to slow down a pflichtausstattung in emergency situations in the European cars.
In fact, they are already duty on all new zugelassenen personenkraftwagen and light kleintransportern, for the rest of the vehicles, a karenzfrist until the end of February 2011 festgesetzt.
The European Union has maβnahme beschlossene to aim to improve the protection of the fuβgänger, however, this bremssysteme can also help because of their way in, many auffahrunfälle.
The task of the notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a kritischen bremsmanövers, what the system on the basis of the drivers ausgeführten bremsstärke on the bremspedal erkennt, auszuüben.
However, this system is not übt this pressure until the end.
According to the komponentenhersteller for the bosch-fahrzeuge gegebene in mission, a third of the inquiry came in an accident before the zusammenstoss verwickelten drivers no longer to do so, on the bremspedal to come and half of them had not with full force abgebremst.
Up to 1.100 accidents
The bremshilfe against resorts with maximaler force in the bremssystem and thereby reduce the bremszeit and thus also the bremsabstand, a car in the bremsvorgang zurücklegt.
According to a study of the EU could each year until 1.100 deadly accidents in which fuβgänger come to harm to be avoided, if all cars were equipped with this type of notbremsassistenten would be.
It would be even less accidents - it is calculated that every fourth accident could be prevented with personenschaden - as soon as the so-called intelligent notbremssysteme popular.
Then there is the fahrzeug equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles erkennt and warns drivers, and at the same time, there has been a slight pressure on the brakes ausübt.
If the driver daraufhin responded, the system helps him, the pressure on the bremspedal to erhöhen, if it would be necessary.
If the driver has not responded to the warning, and even if the zusammenstoss already is inevitable, the bremsassistent übt the maximum pressure on the brakes in order in this way, the damage to keep so gering as possible.
General Motors verschiebt the plan for Opel until January
While the belegschaft of opel-werks in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) already by Nick reilly, the new vorsitzenden von General Motors (GM) Europe, there were unterrichtet that the production of the new Meriva in the first aprilwoche will launch, probably on 8, according to Javier Ortega, the American fahrzeughersteller points out that he needed more time, so the plan to rescue the conclusion Opel.
Nick reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe wants to achieve, namely that the betroffene side their approval to each individual item of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final dokument den arbeitern, the first, and then the governments of the countries in which it works, will be presented until early 2010 will postpone.
Dementgegen from GM will rest assured that, in the next few days, a decision on the sale of Saab meeting.
Since it is not verwunderlich schwedische government that the pressure on the American autobauer erhöht, so that this is a decision as soon as possible.
GM is too, with a number of potential new käufern in contact with.
One of these buyers could also be geely, Volvo, however, would like to buy up wins the option of holländischen herstellers the skyper-sportwagen, of the russischen group has always converg rückendeckung, stärkeren zuspruch.
If it with any of these buyers should come to an agreement, GM could some assets to sell the Chinese baic.
The decision at the end of the year, Saab to schlieβen until then, if it is not sold, will also continue aufrechterhalten.
At the helm of the Porsche boxster spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive juwels the ingenieure used the boxster s as a basis and were there, but it really about 80 kilos of easier to make it just now, womit 1.275 kilo on the waage.
In order to create something, verzichteten you first of all to the automatische aufklappbare dach, which, by a zeltleinwanddach with manuellem antrieb was replaced, so that only one has 21 kilo eingespart; thanks to this model aluminiumtüren used as the gt3 "disappearance" further 15; by the time the klimaanlage herausnahme still 13; auβerdem, the kraftstofftank of 64 at 54 litres verkleinert, so that were further 7 kilo eingespart; by the einbau von sportlichen bacquet-sitzen again 12 and with the light 19-zoll-felgen back five eingespart.
Then we had even more by the verzicht on the audio-system cdr-30 again six kilos of less and through the exchange of türgriffe by griffe substance from the lack of a kilo.
Although he also with the doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, was the probefahrt with a fahrzeug with 6-gängigen handgetriebe, carried out mainly in the smaller landstraβen of California, to bergstrecken, the really very kurvig verliefen.
In his fahrverhalten you can only give him the note tadellos.
The verringerung his gewichts but has not geführtdass now that he no longer so certain on the straβe would lie.
It is, rather, the opposite is the case: for long, as we have no longer such a small and probegefahren leichtes model, but at the same time a also a feeling of safety in the groβer kurven, even in hoher speed,.
It is a small athlet, imstande, his muskeln in a low order in time to make the erforderlichen warm until we give him the befehle to rasen to slow down, to erholen and then once again on the new everything from his motor to bring out...
Everything he does what he says, the car, which makes everything we him with our hands on the steering wheel andeuten, thanks to its lenkung, the equally kommunikativ as precise.
And he does it with a chirurgen präzision.
A motorsound for all geschmacksrichtungen
The sound of his v6 boxers with 320 PS (10 more than the boxster s) is very successful and you can still erhöhen him with the 'sports' -option and by means of a system that can change the motorgeräusche, which already has the panamera to use for the first time.
The beschleunigungsvermögen is unvorstellbar brutal, irrespective of whether from the stand out or to speed up again.
The federungen are strong, but not hard or unbequem.
The asphalt on the landstraβen, on which we took with the boxster spyder, was fairly beschädigt, but the car the schlaglöcher meisterte well.
The electronic assistenten had on the entire distance almost nothing at all to do; and that, although we in some of these kurven EIS in morgengrauen and rollsplitt on vormittag.
Zusammenfassend, one can say that it is a ultraleichtes car, a car, with whom it has a unbeschreiblichen fahrspass, as otherwise it is probably more often and it is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster SS.
The car will appear in the February 2010 come on the market and 70.831 euro costs.
Bag girl '
The cabaret singer, a busenfreundin of Karl lagerfeld, is the face of the kosmetiklinie Coco cocoon and a gelegenheitsstarlett in modenschauen 'Maison', you presented your böses face with the same halsstarrigkeit as their pockets of chanel.
Much more than "bad girl" or "it girl", it is a "bag" girl.

The caja laboral celebrating, despite the many ausgefallenen spieler in the team of dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complex fuβballfeld of maccabi Electra and is therefore in the first place in its Group after the groβartigen appearance of Mirza teletovic, with eight dreifachen the best his team was in the assessment (29).
The team from Vitoria, the significant ausfälle von herrmann, oleson, huertas or micov through a groβe dosis to use and teamarbeit replacement, even if you until bitteren end to their victory muβten wait.
The brilliant right from the perimeter out with 16 bewerteten dreifachen trugen maβgeblich on her final victory in.
The game began with the leadership of the blauroten, from the very beginning to the top on the anzeigentafel.
Since the first four körbe the team from Vitoria already from the perimeter came out, it was already erahnen that you on the pitch with good aufgewärmten handgelenken were reached.
There were English and teletovic, mainly for the 18-20 at the end of the first viertels were responsible.
The second quarter was barely changed, only that the team from Álava for a innenseitiges game from barac entschied and for the game by Eliyahu, in his rückkehr to the team with pfiffen applaus was received and that his home is to further their advantage before the break auszubauen (34-43).
Already, teletovic began as the best of his team with 13 points, including the "hervorzuheben wennn minus six 'assessment of speck already erahnen lieβen that this is not the best night of brasilianers would be.
Nevertheless, the game was in spite of the clear vorteils in the pause is still not decided a long time ago, and the makkabäer wanted the vitorianer again remind you that not everyone on their pitch, and thanks to the constantly angreifenden "hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
And pnini eidson trugen in this crucial that the "gelben" the helm umdrehten (50-49).
More disadvantages.
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything other than dead, had a few spielzüge with treffsicherheit vorbereiten, again in order to get air, and one of them was suddenly the pistole of Mirza teletovic, with three almost aufeinanderfolgenden dreifachen and with the support of English and ribas fall for that on the back einberuhigender anzeigentafel distance of (54-67) was appropriate, the hosts at the end of the third viertels with (57-67) verschönern.
The alavesen were in the last quarter bloβgestellt and English and San emeterio (60-75) has already announced that it would allow niemanden, you win, you are in the first dreiβig minutes had honestly earned back wegzunehmen.
Nichtsdestotrotz resignierten pnini and eidson, the best of their team and not tried again, your team by three points from the line (70-77) force to.
Nevertheless, and despite speck because fouls the place was asked, the team of Ivanovic was not to be defended well and although the Israelis were still in the last minute aufholten (80-85), the game was already a winner and Tel Aviv, lost for the first time this season.

After the verlockendsten days since vergangenem frühjahr, in which the inflation of the assets the vorherrschende mood in the markets has been, is on the markets again the unsicherheit zurückgekehrt, which in any case is verwunderlich, since this is your natürlicher state, in an environment in which the makler decisions on a of nature from uncertain future meetings.
The to stabilise the markets maβnahme angewendete was to the debt with the direktkauf of assets to repay the liquidity and indirectly free hand in interest rates, the move to zero, so that in this way the banks to buy assets abrechnen.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direktkäufe of assets as well as closed, and, without their heterodoxe policy to liquidity in question, start to put something into the sand to streuen getriebe, as the BCE näc already vormachte with their jahresversteigerung, which takes place next week.
That is why the zweifeln investors on the ability of the world economy, the economic erholung without these heterodoxen maβnahmen aufrechtzuerhalten and we are currently witnessing a umkehrung in the reduction of risikoprämien.
The flüchtigkeiten the stock exchanges and the differenzen in the unternehmensboni rise again, even if they are still far removed from the paranormalen beträgen are you achieved to the beginning of the year.
The States are forced, saw the private risks to nationalise the staatsschulden and rise again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred zufluchtsort of investors, which in turn to an increase of differenzen in respect of the countries of the eurozone in Germany.
Spain has been, until now, little of this episode of instabilität affected, but then came in the Standard & Poor's and drohte with a new revision downwards on the assessment spaniens.
On the other hand, is not a certain unsicherheit, the defenders of the moralischen risikos to schweigen, had tried again, with the leaders of the weltwirtschaftspolitik an awareness, for what they had caused, too, since they produce the verheerenden wirkungen, to which the restriction of loans that led to the loss of arbeitsstellen abgebremst than they actually had a new day for dankesaktion beschlieβen should have.
Nichtsdestotrotz deutet what happened in Dubai, in a stammeskrieg between the emiren out to restore power in den emiraten and the development in griechenland was also previously vorhergesehen already.
A government which the staatsverschuldung verschweigt, elections and a new government, which is in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the nichterfüllung their auslandszahlungen rettet, and therefore a euro-mitgliedsland zugesteht, his verpflichtungen no longer nachzukommen.
It is against that Ecofin griechische logisch, the government has forced, to be transparent and its citizens in need of auβergewöhnlicchen maβnahmen with in the duty, in order to maintain the stability of the state money.
Yes, we find ourselves as expected in an episode of the risikoprämien normalisierung, after some ausschweifungen on to high amounts, it would now fall within the erwarteten.
In the case of spaniens we must not make the staatsverschuldung, as long as the differenzen with the same speed as the European unternehmensboni erhöhen.
However, should the European differences vermindern and the Spanish further dannn erhöhen, there would be a special spanisches risk in order to act.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the hiesigen vorgezogenen indikatoren a groβteil of marktforschungsinstitute to forsake their szenarien for erholung vorzuziehen and their szenario for 2011 to correct einschlieβlich upwards, the ocde and of the European Commission, in the back with a Japanese szenario for the Spanish economy, despite all the promises daherkommen warnungen no long life.
Once again it has quite den anschein, that there will be a hervorragende opportunity to purchase a Spanish shares, although at the moment is to drive "caution" angesagt.

After his appearance, the chairman of gas natural-fenosa, Rafael villaseca followed Galán, gave the press some stichpunkte on what he versschlossenen unterausschuss behind the doors had made.
According to the vorsitzenden Iberdrola of Spain needs by 2020 of 50 billion euround further 60 billion as of this date until 2030, invest in the vorraussetzung that the current nuclear power stations also continue to remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, would the benötigten investment not to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion total.
Iberdrola is, however, of the opinion that it is no longer in an increase in the energieerzeugungskapazität should invest, but in verteilernetze and international verbünde.
From 2020 will be the fragestellung and we should change the performance erhöhen.
His proposal focuses both on gas and kohlewerke with facilities for auffangen of kohlendioxids and, of course, especially in the renewable energies.
In this case he is assuming that 18.000 MW more are needed, under the vorraussetzungnatürlich by other "stützenergien".
Galán, the view is that the gesetentwurf for a nachhaltige economy, just adopted by the government, on a line with what his company is called for, in no case has wanted to say anything against this law, such as anreize for the national kohleverbrauch, what exactly the opposite of all political strategien in the fight against climate change would be.
In his opinion, "in the long term, it is clearly in this direction, in spite of some" individual "maβnahmen, as the chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it as it may, thinks Galán, that we now have the decisions on the investment, even if these are, in the long term, since it should take some time and will need a stabiler vergütungsrahmen must be created, in order to tackle them.

Acciona kämpft for bewilligung his first motorway in Australia, a market in which they already as energy and wasserunternehmen are represented.
The construction, which it is, is a tunnel, the 1.7 billion australische dollar (approximately 1,047 billion euros) costs.
The French companies Bouygues and the German hochtief, while its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the best opportunity to become acciona, a construction company in the country and to autobahnbetreiber etablieren.
The City Council would have completed the construction by the end of 2014.
After the administration for a öffentlich-private cooperation (PPP is the englische abkürzung) had decided the project after a serious & Young aufgestellten geschäftsplan voranzutreiben, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and the mautstellenverwaltung.
In erwartung präsentierten amount in May, offers the geschätzten investment at 1.7 billion dollars (1,047 australische billion euros), while in the last phase three konsortien, especially from European construction company bestehend, compete with each other.
The group with the name will transcity of acciona, the only Spanish companies, and its partners are BMD and ghella.
The first company is one of the gröβten australiens construction company, while the second with headquarters in Italy, one of the best specialists for tiefbau.

The australische market for infrastructures and promises gewaltige bauarbeiten privatisierungen, however, has a hürde, it is true, as it only to überwinden, through the purchase of a einheimischen zutritt bauunternehmens.
A strategie, of the aforementioned companies or bilfinger hochtief, in addition to Asian referenzen, followed, and of the Spanish baugiganten only still must be pursued.
ACS has itself on this market only by his participation of 30% in hochtief eigentümerin, the aforementioned leighton, zutritt erlangt.
Million in assets
Acciona is counting on this geographische region von höchster importance for the industry, in which it already because of his work as a energieversorger and in the entsalzungsindustrie is very well known.
Among other assets it already has its gröβten windmühlenpark (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies, which has been in charge, the entsalzungsanlage of Adelaide, with a budget of EUR 700 million to build and manage.

This is the gröβte maβnahme to staureduzierung on the straβen of Brisbane.
The City Council is the vergabe ausgegebene fahrplan for summer 2010 before and the launch of the bauarbeiten in December next year.
Even if these mautstrecke already for the transport in recent months by 2014 to öffnen, the assumption is that the bauarbeiten until 2016 andauern.
The tunnel was drafted in 2005.
He has two fahrspuren in every direction, a elektronisches mautsystem and a complex entlüftungssystem.
The government of queensland is involved with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the funding.

Leader of this list is Manchester United.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
The Champions League to win the UEFA, brings not only glory. It is also one of the haupteinnahmequellen the big clubs.
The League has the UEFA, according to 5.362,5 million euros to the 105 mannschaften (Spanish), 12 of them in this veranstaltung since its creation in the season 1992 / 1993, distributed to participate.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have from this distribution profitiert.
The weiβe club is in third place in Europe, the most money earned through its participation, and in addition to AC Milan, the only person who has won the trophäe dreimal.
The amtierende katalanische master and recent winners of the former europacups 1992 proves the fünften place.
Manchester United lead the list and Bavaria in Munich, two mannschaften, the auβerdem also most money through their participation in the last champoins League revenue.
And this, even though they are against Barça have lost.
On the other hand, is Spain only to third place, the countries by the champions einehmen money, although it has more titles than any other (five, in contrast to four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This offensichtliche contradiction declared by the complex gelderteilungsverfahren, uses the UEFA.
In this geschäftsjahr expects the organisation, whose vorsitz Michel Platini has held, with revenue of 1.090 million by the Champions League.
This money is the UEFA 413,1 million for firm zahlungen before: each of the 20 fuβballclubs, who was on the qualifikationsvorrunde teilnahmen (among them the atlético de Madrid) bekam 2.1 million.
Auβerdem found those who acquired a participation, 3.8 million through their bloβe presence, in addition to the 550.000 euro for each game that you bestritten.
There is also still a bonus for winning (800.000 euro) and for a unentschieden (400 000 per team). The clubs who have come into achtelfinale, each received three million; the four who have come into viertelfinale, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winners is worthy of 9 million, in contrast to the second, which receives 5,2 million.
So get at least a fuβballclub 7.1 million and a maximum of 31,2 festen million in revenue.
Barça earned, in turn, with his victory in the European supercup 2.5 million in August.
However, there are still the variablen zahlungen, for the 337,8 million are planned.
This money is proportional to the value of each individual fernsehmarkts vergeben.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has four zugeteilte seats.
The master of last year gets 40% of gelds zugewiesenen, 30% of the second, 20% of the drittplatzierte and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is depending on the number of games they play in the diesjährigen edition, distributed.

New programmes to begutachtung von fahrzeugen
In these days of unwettern unfällen verdienen, and not only the kfz-werkstätten
Every day, thousands of fahrzeugen, which will be in an accident verwickelt, were in the werkstätten geschleppt, where a gutachter caused the damage and the cost of the reparatur must assess.
Not a single accident is equal and the berechnung the cost of the parts and arbeitsstunden can a langwierige and complex task.
The berechnung the reparaturkosten of between 20 and 30.000 euro by hand, einschlieβlich of parts and arbeitsstunden, can take up to two or three hours to take.
It is, however, with the support of the latest informatiktools a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% use the gutachter these kinds of systems.
The dienstleistungs- and anwendungsanbieter for the assessment of unfällen instandsetzung and collect the information they receive from the herstellern, in order then to bearbeiten and their customers in the form of a nützlichen programme.
In Spain is audatex, part of the American group solera, the leader; 80% of all be gutachten erstellt with their produkten.
The other two companies, with the tool-markt for begutachtung ausarbeitung compete and a berichts, are gtmotive and eurotax.
The work with the data which the manufacturer, is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, verkaufsleiter of audatex, with 63 herstellern importeuren and worked with some of them, each in a different format, the information available.
Auβerdem will always to bearbeitende datenmenge gröβer, up to the point that in the last five years or longer versions, and motorisierungen varianten came on the market, as in the entire fünfzehn years before.
As soon as a new car on the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a mühsame task, because jedeseinzelnde the abertausend fahrzeugeteile must be katagolisiert eingegeben and price.
In addition, each model an "intelligent" graphikbild erstellt, on the various parts of the fahrzeugs "anklicken".
If there is a much verkauftes model, the work could be completed in a week if the procedure zügig vorangeht.
If there is a less gebräuchliches car, once before it can take up to three or four months last. Audatex gegenwärtig has in 99,2% in Spain vertriebenen cars on vollständige information.
Under the exklusiveren modellen you have, for example, on information about the porsche-modelle, but not about Ferrari and Lamborghini.
In relation to the on the straβen fahrenden fahrzeugpark there are about 99%.
Zwecks ausführung of the dokumentationsarbeiten and the manufacture of databases, audatex worldwide on eight (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) verteilte centres and each one of them has to certain brands spezialisiert.
The national hauptsitz is in alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred techniker (normally fachleute for mechanik) simultan with three computerbildschirmen.

Each month, they take 2.5 million data on their customers and get the aktualisierungen every second day.
The ausarbeitung this enormous informationsflusses allows the companies, this in different ways and different products to use it.
The häufigste use is the use of the reparaturen and instandsetzungen, depending on the country, however, there are also tools for the administration of schrottteilen or to berechnung of feil- or restwerts of cars.
The only companies that have a Führer, on the value of the gebrauchtwagen in Spain, is informed eurotax.
Audatex this offer is not in Spain, but in the United States.
In the durchsicht of products, offering the audatex, one can easily a überblick verschaffen about the kind of support they are the branchenexperten.
The company offers ten different tools, but the star of the products audaplus, a standardlösung to begutachutng of unfällen for gutachter.
It includes, motorräder vehicles and light and heavy industriefahrzeuge.
Auβer the cost of the parts, it contains the manufacturers geschätzten reparaturzeiten or the lackierungspreise.
This tool will ever after verwendungszweck, i.e., paid for each gutachten.
It will be the most expensive for customers, it rarely, use a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5,75 euros per month.
Against any versicherungsgesellschaft negotiated, the thousands of gutachten anfertigt, the price with audatex.
With other products, such as audavin, can be a fahrzeug and ausstattung, with the montageband ran alone, on the basis of the fahrgestellnummer fully identifizieren.
Audaglass deals with the fahrzeugscheiben, and audasubastas is a for the fachmarkt open service on the Internet, with whom it is for vehicles, which, for totalschaden has been declared, can offer.
Her statistikservice is very useful in the identification of trends, durchführung of geodemographischen analyses or zwecks receipt of information on the abweichungen after brand and model.
You can look so that, for example, how many of a certain automarke modelle because of pannen in the werkstatt had or how many of them in a certain period in a serious accident verwickelt.
GT motive is the only Spanish companies, which is the development of this type of computertools devotes.
It vertreibt among other GT estimate, which is intended for gutachter also and at the same kind of digitale images, access to parts or prices and official arbeitszeiten of herstellers, provides.

Since the 2007 they are on the New York stock exchange and part of the referenzindexes Standard & Poor 'S.
Von unfallautos auction on the Internet.
In October the group vergangenem kaufte solera autoonline a plattfom on the Internet for the sale of unfallfahrzeugen- and motorrädern.
This purchase bedeutete the remuneration of 59,5 million euros for 85% of the capital of the society, which is in the next year to the other 15% could erhöhen.
The purpose of this kaufes was to his customers more services and offer wertsteigerung, with the possibility of access to a riesigeen international market.
This begutachtungs- and kaufservice wendet ausschlieβlich itself to branchenfachleute, as versicherungsgesellschaften, gutachter, autovermietungsunternehmen, werkstätten, schrottplätze and autohändler who take their activities must be registered.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and managed more than 650.000 operationen in the whole of Europe, 500 000 of them in Germany alone.
Their hauptmärkte are Spain, griechenland, Poland and the türkei.
The website now has more than 1.500 registrierte verkäufer and 4.000 gutachter.
Be daily 3.000 anzeigen and managed to reach the Spanish market every day 100 new anzeigen.
According to the Spanish legislation is a fahrzeug, whose fahrgestellnumer abgemeldet, was no longer in the straβen drive, it must not, however, certain beschädigte parts as ersatzteile used.
The cars with historischem value must again be against zugelassen, even if they have been following difficult behördengängen abgemeldet.
The werkstatt kostenvoranschlag in four steps
With the tool auda-taller represents the company audatex sure that the users in only four steps receives a kostenvoranschlag: identification of fahrzeugs, search of the ersatzteils, drafting and developing a kostenvoranschlags.
The slight handhabung these systems is a grundsätzliche condition, especially in order to convince the elderly fachleute, the normally more or less against the use of these new computertechniken.
The database includes 1.034, 666 vehicles that are personenkraftfahrzeuge geländewagen, 109, 137 motorräder, 78 kleintransporter and 44 lastwagen.
Of course we need to use a computer with internetverbindung.
After the reparierende model based on the fahrgestellnummer has been identified, seems a grafik of jeweiligen model and then will be the benötigte ersatzteil selected.
The user can play with einbeziehen variablen, as the price for the arbeitsstunden, aufpreise or rabatte and then he can leave the kostenvoranschlag ausdrucken and pass on to his customers.
Audataller, however, is not a tool to begutachtung as audaplus, but rather a referenzkatalog.
Hauptunterschied between the two systems are that the on diewerkstatt ausgerichtete contains no geschätzten arbeitszeiten.
The verwendungskosten for this tool for 350 euros a year, a betrag, the customer can easily pay.
At the time, the company is working audatex, these images also in dreidimensionalen format anbieten.
It is an innovation, on the automechaniker long wait because it with her, for example, a door auswählen can and and the picture then can fully umdrehen the innenseite.
