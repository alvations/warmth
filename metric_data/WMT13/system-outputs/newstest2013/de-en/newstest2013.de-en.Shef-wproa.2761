A Republican strategy in order to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat, the electoral fraud.
However, the latter Brennan Center for a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud in the US is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the US, moreover, only 300 cases of fraud.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada are the States for the implementation of the elections in the individual States.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, the new laws announced the procedure for the registration or the ballot.
This phenomenon has, after the elections in November 2010 grown in importance, in which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries could be recorded.
As a result, 180 draft laws alone were introduced in the year 2011, the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States.
The new electoral laws demand that the voters and proof of a Lichtbildausweis US-Staatsbürgerschaft.
In addition, these laws also the periods for the early vote shortened, the right declared invalid, on the day, to register as voters and citizens of the right to vote, for which a Gerichtsakte.
Before the elections in 2006, no US State of the voters asked to produce a Lichtbildausweis.
Indiana was the first federal state, of such a request.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed, this practice to other States.
Over the last two years, encouraged in 34 States draft legislation, with which the voters are forced to produce a Lichtbildausweis.
It is important to note that the US in contrast to Quebec not on a universal cards as the health card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens have, i.e. non-German 21 million people do not of a governmental authority of their state Lichtbildausweis issued.
Moreover, five million Neuwähler in 2012, not on such a card.
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay the necessary card.
Of the new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low incomes disproportionately affected.
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years, not on the necessary Lichtbildausweis.
This goes further.
The students, be regarded as the electorate that their voice more for democratic candidates, it is not permitted in several countries, their Lichtbildausweis issued to use its establishment.
On the other hand, these same States allow members of Angel- or Jagdvereinen, the more for the Republican side to choose which of these associations cards issued for elections to be used.
Before 2004, has no state for the rational proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first federal state, of such a request.
For 2011 have a dozen countries, the laws adopted by the voters demand that they demonstrate their US-Staatsbürgerschaft.
These measures are clearly, to limit the Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters, the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republican legislators 2011 in eight States laws, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
Moreover, you have the right of individuals and groups, those voters limited to assist the wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns to electoral registration in the general elections in 2004 helped, around 10 million citizens to register.
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006 to 17%.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators in another five States adopted legislation aimed at the period for the early vote.
For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida 33% of voters who elected in advance, African-Americans, even though it is only 13% of the voters of the federal state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter, only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who have elected in advance.
In contrast, the white, 76% of voters, only 46% of voters who elected in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws, the registration of voters.
Several proposals have been through the vetoes of the democratic governors blocked.
The Advocate-General of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could limit the damage caused in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 States have adopted legislation, which just a Lichtbildausweises demand.
However, the new rules introduced in the year 2012, without doubt, the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.
The democratic critics point the party political nature of the laws passed on and to see them as a clear objective of the influence of the results in the crucial States for 2012.
A report of the centres of 2011 Brennan shows that those States that these laws have adopted, 171 of 270 votes, in the Electoral College are needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to with certainty to confirm that these changes to the legislation on electoral system, a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: the test should be made or not?
The PSA-Test, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, but also with false negative or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation the already undecided men for the implementation of Früherkennungstests.
The test should be made or not?
We have sought the opinion of two consultant.
In the studies conducted in the United States were many disruptors between the control, so that it is difficult to interpret these data and clear recommendations.
A further study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection.
This study has also shown that, when Nachbeobachtung after 12 years of the likelihood of the education of metastases 30 to 40% higher, if no screening has been carried out.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years ago, when one has a direct relatives to prostate cancer, which was already ill.
In men afro-amerikanischer origin is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to take the right decision, as soon as a cancer was recognised.
There are cancers, the aggressive and others, the indolent.
The patient must the scale of the risk of its cancer really understandable, be made by him the possible options, which remain untouched Prostatakrebse can, if he the quality of life in the long term, and it is not affected in these cases for a more active monitoring of the disease.
Today, will take place in many men, in which it has not recognised, cancer treatment, because their cancer is aggressive and not a threat to their lives.
It proposes them an active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
We certainly with greater accuracy the criteria for a decision, who should be dealt with and who does not.
I therefore recommend, however, the implementation of the tests.
The most important, but it is to speak with his doctor in order to determine whether it should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the international society for Urologie Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible, the advantages and disadvantages of the widespread PSA testing.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research is the adoption of a healthy lifestyle the best way, in order to reduce the risk, to him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all good enough to eat and would move.
'If there is no smokers more, this value at least 50% increase, "stresses André Beaulieu, the spokesperson of the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft.
However, is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unresolved.
For the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft remains the fight against tobacco addiction a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of people.
'Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million smokers' regrets the spokesman of André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
In accordance with the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft overweight and obesity-related health issues also promote the outbreak of disease.
They seem the risk for breast, Grimmdarm-, Mastdarm- Speiseröhren- Bauchspeicheldrüsen-, to increase, and cervical cancer.
'The research shows that a regular physical activity during the whole life against Grimmdarmkrebs protects', he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends, the consumption of red meat.
In too great deal, it increases the risk of a Grimm- or Mastdarmkrebs to become ill.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat civilization once lived quite hygienically by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the education of carcinogens.
'the latter can damage the cells and the development of cancer, "he says.
Vitamins
In recent years have a number of scientists the connection between Vitaminzusätzen and cancer.
But their studies are currently not conclusive.
The Canadian Krebsgesellschaft are the studies to vitamin E contradictory.
While a study which reduce the risk of prostate cancer was discovered, showed a different rather an increase.
The effect of Vitamin D on the cancer has also not yet made quite clear.
Furthermore, Mr Beaulieu, stressed how important it is, with his doctor of its concerns and his family down to speak.
'The implementation of a Früherkennungstest does not lead to cancer'.
The analyses Higgs-Boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs-Bosons last summer, a certain degree of attention, and for good reason.
We believe that in fact, this Boson to nothing less than the mechanism is involved, for the mass of objects in the universe is responsible.
Lastly, it is the last particles, whose existence of the Standard Model - our best or 'least false' statement by the nature and the behaviour of the matter - predicted empirically, but not yet been observed.
But for the physicist, it is still not entirely sure that it really the Higgs.
We know, without a shadow of doubt that we have a genuine new particles, and that the predicted Higgs-Boson greatly resembles the Standard Model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data in this week on a large Physik-Kongress were presented in Kyoto, but it still lacking data, in order to be completely safe.
We nevertheless believe that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a minimal risk, to deceive, and we are looking at what is at stake.
There is in this world a necessarily inescapable law, which means that two objects not at the same time, there can be the same place.
It is not possible, against this rule - and you are trying to break it is not too much, as you will hurt.
Because even if the particle physics a truly strange world is, turns out that it also such a law applies: the Pauli Clausewitzian Ausschlussprinzip, which says that two particles not the same room at the same time, if they can fill in the same 'Quantenzustand', and this' state 'by and large from some of their characteristics.
On this basis, the physicist share the particles in two categories.
In a corner of the good citizens, be described as Fermione and lastly the Pauli principles.
And in the other the Bosonen a vile, gang of anarchists, which nothing is sacred - not in any case this principle, which means that they are in fact, at the same time on the same place.
These Bosonen is in accordance with the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Mesonen we are not be discussing and the 'Kraftteilchen', by the major forces of nature and with which the Higgs-Boson somehow be used.
There must be emphasised, however, that these Bosonen not all such exotic creatures are, as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the Photon or the 'Lichtteilchen', that of 'messenger' of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle speeded up with an electrical goods or the direction of change, the electromagnetic fields precisely in this place 'disrupted', such as a pebble that has been thrown into a pond.
By this' disturbance 'is an electromagnetic wave (light Infrarot- or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a Photon Bosonen and therefore one of the "bearer of force'.
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another area that Higgs-Feld must be ',' disrupted, so that this Boson shows.
However, the Higgs-Feld very much more stable than the electromagnetic fields; the pathogens must achieve very high energy, a bit like a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks zerfurcht.
That is why a huge Teilchenbeschleuniger like CERN necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic fields is again helpful in the relationship between the Higgs and the mass to explain.
There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic fields.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but not others - a piece of paper, for example, would never even in the refrigerator.
Not all particles and equally interact with the Higgs-Feld: those that do have a mass, while the other (as the Photon) no mass.
For what can all these research now be 'good' asks Mrs Plamondon?
For the science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they will enable the physicists also, all the differences between the observations and the predictions of SM carefully to examine.
There are also numerous physicist, the truly hope that such derogations to be found, since the slightest difference a door to a 'new physics' open and some of the model could fill holes.
We must say that the latter still major shortcomings, since there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which provides approximately 80% of the matter of the universe (once again ups!).
However, when CERN such derogations until now not been found.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.
Incidentally, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of Lasers in the Bell-Laboren not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle - which has worked in the Bell Labs, where lasers in the 1960 ’ s was invented the 1962, and even the first Dauerstrichlaser (were the first gepulst) has developed - already said that the lasers at the beginning, rather than a 'Laborspielerei'.
Imagine...
Moreover, can also applications from all the instruments which surrounded the research.
Willard Boyle 1969, in turn, has, for example, during its work in the optics a small Lichtsensor developed.
Although it was not the original purpose, the purpose of this sensor today all digital cameras in the world as' an eye and has he 2009 the Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC necessarily change our lives, but it means that it really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die | Le Devoir...
With its Committee on 'death in Quebec dignity' has recently the sensitive issue of Lebensendes discussed.
The debate will soon have to be resumed, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, in this important area still much to do.
Le Devoir has tried, to look as this.
A few weeks ago lived Mr L. still alone in his home in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, the aufzehrte him, he had a period of two years.
'You gave me five years to live, I have managed to seven years', he said, half-hearted, in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, in which he arrived the day.
'But, it is always a shock, which is something we can not be prepared for', he says.
The disease is doing its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents any alone to use the toilet and even to eat.
On the table a delicious lunch, he resigned itself to do, at the Essen to help.
Courageous he manages to smile and even to talk to strangers, which employs around him, his medicine, and a bad.
The courage of the ordinary death.
'My greatest hope is that one of my diarrhea, because that is humiliating cure', does he share with.
A few hours later, the team a cure for this evil.
'In the course of our lives, we learn that a man on pinkelt', a psychologist told Pierre Brodeur Victor-Gadbois in the home.
In the Kindheitsphase is for certain persons to return to an unacceptable humiliation.
'The depends on the ability of the person', a step backwards, he notes.
Because, in view of several people who work in the palliative care, major events in the midst of this step backwards.
The patients in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois be trained, are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they will of the doctors and nurses, who look after them, not more with so-called 'curative' care.
For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear, 'deliberately and by suffocation' to die.
But by the disease, I have really got to know my children.
'I have good children', she adds.
'I have no requests more in the life', it says, before they accepted that it is a mask aufsetzt, it helps to breathe.
It expects the next few days in a recent visit of her son, from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois provides it with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance in the food.
The palliative care will be used if there is no other means.
In order to make the deaths of more pleasant.
In Quebec is to state for the inhabitants of a bed palliative care.
That is very little, if one takes into account that one day we all will die.
This is the continued life in the best possible conditions, Dr Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of homes.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual own comfort.
It grants the dying according to the desire a Mundpflege with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics must no longer control their Blutzuckerspiegel.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we have Mr X a beer, served in the course of the night has died.
This morning will be son the beer at the feet of the deceased austrinken.
'We help patients' families and equally, reported Pflegedirektorin Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor-Gadbois is not a day as the other.
In addition to an old man from 93 years, the last Familienzusammenkunft in the Court and good of his Kopfkissen, while opening up to its honour of a young man of 36 years of his parents, his wife and two small children is surrounded, tragically, after he has tried everything in order to survive.
'For six months are three to five beds always with cancer patients in the age of less than 45 years proves' shares Dr Christiane Martel concerned with.
53% of patients admitted into the homes Victor-Gadbois come from their Wohnstätte, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It says that 77% of the Canadians have no access to palliative care, in other words a care, which is to alleviate the suffering of patients, if the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organisations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the society for domestic palliative care of the Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this major shortcoming in the healthcare Quebec ensures that several of them in the palliative care specialist doctors the adoption of a law regulating of euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with reservations.
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, the prominent personalities of palliative care as Dr Balfour Mount and Doctor Bernard Lapointe signed to their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr Christiane Martel Quebec, according to the health system is not effective enough, in order to ensure that all the right to a high-quality palliative care, before we have accepted, on euthanasia.
Recently, it says that I have seen a patient, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room was, without that it has taken measures to alleviate.
I fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
And, at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of the worst predictions stubbornly to the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as it is an onerous chemotherapy.
When I told my Onkologin that I will stop the treatment, it has replied that they regret that the fight, told they please.
However, they told me that I was at the end.
No omnipotente care
Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, to thank the staff that it has not granted this desire, after their pain of a team of palliative care have been mitigated.
But it must be clearly stated that the palliative care in the Schmerzbehandlung is not omnipotent.
After Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care of the society of the domestic palliative care of the Greater Montreal 8% of patients do not speak on a Schmerzbehandlung.
At the very end of life, the doctors so often the terminale Sedierung, which amounts to the patient either sporadically or permanently einzuschläfern by the time of his death.
We can no longer act as if we do not accept this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the possibility of recourse to these terminale Sedierung.
Patients, not alleviate the pain, are all saying the same sentence: 'I want to die'.
But this does not necessarily, 'I want to me that you will euthanise' but I would like to be relieved that my pain '.
The implementation of this report was possible because of a Journalismusstipendiums Canadian Gesundheitsforschungsinstitute.
Immobilienskandale large scale in Quebec
Officials of the Straßenbauamtes Bauhauptgewerbes Geldbeschaffer of political parties and specialists, the Italian mafia tell every day, what they have a great 'system' know, in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso are enmeshed.
A 'industry', which for the taxpayers of Quebec was very expensive, especially in the 1990 ’ s and 2000 ’ s.
'It is strange, as the system is falling apart, since the drastic measures', witzelt Jacques Duchesneau, MEP in Quebec and a former head of the police Montreal.
The scandal was it due to a thorough investigation of embezzlement in connection with the Treaties to Straßenbauarbeiten revealed in Quebec, of the then Prime Minister only reluctantly agreed to.
The 'Duchesneau-Bericht' established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and corruption of officials.
'Since the beginning of the investigation in the year 2010', it stresses, 'would have only the Ministry of a billion dollars in the Treaties' saved, because some zügelten their instinct in order to receive their share.
The two mayors Charbonneau-Kommission 'has already brought', he adds in the hope that it succeeds, 'to the tactics behind the individuals'.
Launched a 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit
The 2011 was launched, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit is doing with their troops to accountants, establish and analysts of the government also great efforts.
In addition, the police officers of the 'Marteau-Truppe' since 2009, which has meant that the 'Kanalisationskartell' of Montreal in artificial inflation of the Treaties more restrained going on...
In recent weeks it has made with a whole series of raids and accusations of fraud and corruption against local officials like Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, particularly from his post as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec, resigned.
He is suspected of, in exchange for public contracts to have repeatedly taken bribes.
Moreover, explicitly accused of engineers of the Montreal Straßenbauamts, and entrepreneurs Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has a sensation, by providing the Commission the operation of the 'system' for the preservation of public contracts.
He himself has several years of 3% of the value of the Treaties in Montreal received a with the Mafia intermediaries, the money paid to the Union Montreal, the party of mayors Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito everywhere in the 2000 ’ s had its hand in it by more than 88 000 Canadian dollar (around EUR 68) Provinzparteien, especially at the time in power gewesenen Liberals.
He also acknowledged, an illegal funds for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau to have organised.
Kanalisationsverträge, the costs of him have been artificially inflated
In Montreal, the 'system' of the corruption smoothly.
The former a civil engineer Gilles Surprenant this before the Commission has described in detail: in ten years, he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, Golf-Turnieren, restaurants and Eishockey-Spielen, and in tune of $736.000 bribes in return for Kanalisationsverträge, whose cost it artificially.
Other officials of the Straßenbauamtes have admitted that it is insuring by the accounts with false additional artificially aufblähten to 30-40%.
Moreover, a organisers of the Party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay that he accused of deliberately on a shadow budget has overlooked, of its coffers with black filled.
As a result of these revelations is Mr Tremblay at the beginning of November, which resigned Montreal in a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Members of Montreal, the alarm.
As Mayor of Stadtbezirks Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, rejected, as from 2010 on the sale of a Gemeindegrundstücks on that, for $5 million acquired and for 1.6 million to developers in the booming housing market has been sold.
70% of black money in the election campaigns
The investigation is carried out, which ultimately, it says that they 'to a thread that allows the functioning of Ameisen unterwanderten system to understand, in order to stop this evil and denounce the guilty parties'.
She says that the procedure 'painful, but positive'.
We are in the wound up, however, one need only for Montreal certain fraud investigation unit, and a supervision, with a return of the questionable practices.
How clean.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that 'officials, several hundred million dollars stolen', but particularly concerned about the role of the 'elected representatives, on the tactics are aware, if they are not involved in fraud.
On the basis of a 70% of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec witzelt it: 'I have been told that this is a poor substitute the reality.'
The government of Quebec proposes that the donations to parties at $100, which according to him, nothing would change the situation: 'As long as the pre-election campaign expenditure by not be strictly limited, black money in circulation in the policy'.
It recommends a complete revision of the system for awarding public contracts and the funding of parties: 'We cannot deeper; by the things with courage to the bottom of the House, we can go on a more solid basis with more controls and rebuild' laws.
If this history of the international image of Quebec and the Montreal, is Mr Duchesneau those who laugh a look in its own backyard to...
'PSG is not the Barcelona!'
In this season PSG have you with a new scale.
How do you explain this progress?
It cannot by a personal view, but also by the new dimension of the PSG explain.
Great players are.
Every day, I am making progress on their side.
The technical staff has also given a lot to me.
These elements spur me to my Spielniveau on a daily basis, to improve.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football is all very quickly.
But I do not breche in enthusiasm.
Since my origins in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my Spielzeit in gradually Saint-Etienne I have always made progress.
They are thus the advantage of by Carlo Ancelotti competition introduced...
The new entrants of this summer are accustomed, Games very high level.
They also know that any Trainingseinheit is crucial.
This means that a player, as I have to stand up to and want to give its best.
Incidentally, it gives me Carlo Ancelotti much in relation to my Spielposition.
It will be supported by Co-Trainern as Claude Makelele, on the same position as I was.
Ancelotti is the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills all the technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and it is the best coaches of Europe.
He has a rich experience and has many title with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with major players.
I think that it will gain further title in Paris.
In January, I have an encouraging talk with him.
At that time, I have just recovered from a Verletzungsserie.
The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation of my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?
In the Ligue 1 has Lyon Spitzenreiters the place of us.
But we lurk in ambush.
One of our most important objectives is the Champions League: we have in this way to the final 8 qualified.
What is the objective of the club in this competition?
We will try, as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
We will, however, against a very good European teams have our say.
Firstly, we want first of our group in Porto, so that we return leg of the Achtelfinales out as does best.
Can the PSG in the short term, a great European club?
He has already the budget for...
In order to be a great European club, Paris title must win a name and long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially is the PSG the funds, so that this project takes concrete forms.
It would be a great failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 to gain, as in the last season was the case?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really to cream off this title.
In the last season, we were close off.
In May, we were disappointed, because we have been strong enough to the victory.
We have the season with a very strong performance closed.
We have concluded with 79 points.
We should normally be master with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right.
Even if the big teams like Marseilles, Lyon or Bordeaux the title, I believe that we have the stuff to him to win.
Do you think that the media to expect much from PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players, we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept the perfect.
However, if we in a does best against Troyes 4-0 gain, and we still find something to what we can accuse us of this is certainly somewhat frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never win with 4-0 every weekend.
We are not of the Barcelona!
We are trying to establish a Spielkonzept.
Building a team with the time.
In the Champions League, we have shown strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, not to qualify for the final 8, and which also has huge expenditure.
In view of the sums invested believed you to time out with 15 points ahead!
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, the last season were not well, this new PSG 'geboostet'.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we in the month of May the smiling will be winners and tell us that we finally, despite all the difficulties they have won.
The PSG seems completely from the achievements of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to be dependent on.
In order better to be a 'Zlatan-Abhängigkeit'.
This means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and many goals.
That is why it is, and it shows that he is the star the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that it is a great players and a world star with respect.
Within the team, we respect both the players and the person.
He also respected the people who surround him.
What he has done, is exceptional.
This encourages others, to improve their Spielniveau.
Thiago Silva, the world is one of the best defenders, it allows all others also to make progress.
As you have the Euro 2012 seen with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in the Euro.
Unfortunately, my violation prevented from something obscene Spielzeit.
I have seen things there emerged strengthened from which I am.
Today, I am, good Games in the national team.
This was since my baptism with the 'Bleus' my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learnt our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views to the first few months by Didier Deschamps at the top of the 'Bleus'?
He has promising results achieved.
We have a good position in the Qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup.
The coaches is strictly, is close to the players and encourages the victory.
As it was also Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to no comparison.
Blanc had achieved its objective, by giving us for Euro qualified.
I hope that the 'Bleus Didier Deschamps' to Brazil.
Is that on 16 October in Spain forced draw (1: 1) a Auftaktspiel?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has for all the other.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never been a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin is possible without paying and selling Bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and administrative fees between the parties involved.
Furthermore, as so often in these technologies to reach a political vision: the conviction that the current Bankmonopolen structured monetary system, to financial crises.
That is indeed of Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) trumped-up Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in the dollar, euro, etc., convertible) and a protocol for the safe exchange as BitTorrent, the direct exchange of files.
With 15 000 computers in the network have already been some 200,000 transactions.
A few thousand Web sites Bitcoin accept as donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011 a high of $30 (23 euro), five months later he fell to $2 today, before he has recovered to around $10 (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive in comparison with the world trade from real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB), in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest shown for this.
It describes Bitcoin as' the virtual currency with the greatest success', 'in competition with the dollar or the euro' and 'similar to the conventional currencies'.
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the 'bill' that will be used to make progress in a video game that we gain by Games, or buy (and sometimes zurücktauschen).
The social networking site Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
Every time, however, the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed.
With Bitcoin are all Netzknoten Rechnungsbuchs repositories of the same time, Auditors, Geld-Emittenten and buyers and sellers.
So what does this network?
Each transaction between two users will take place in reality, between two e-mail addresses in the form of e-mail.
With the difference that the user to pay for any other, can choose what the anonymity.
A number of this operation in connection with the data will be signed electronically by a double cypher system.
In this way can the network of the authenticity of the transaction.
By means of the content of the database, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the whole network widespread Rechnungsbuch of public accounts are there.
The decisive step is that this new transaction in this book.
This is happening on a mathematical task, which will be launched on computers, with the winners, a kind of preliminary Zentralbankier, has the privilege, this additional line to add.
It is a Zerstückeln the file, i.e. transforming a major file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprinting.
The computer 'take' the new transaction and do it in a number, before the whole 'zerhackt'.
The aim is, the number to find a special fingerprint (many zeros) at the beginning.
If this figure has been found, the other knot can easily examine whether it is the right one.
The transaction is in the long term with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprints.
If a user to cheat two time very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay, would only one of the two transactions to be validated by the network and the other if there is no link, as both different fingerprints.
The computer, the task has been resolved, 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will reward this regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, what a certain room for manoeuvre...
Moreover, the difficulty of the task with any improvement of Rechenleistung increased.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The website, the services for Bitcoin, have been attacked and the Bitcoin-Einlagen stolen.
'The used weakness is not the real Minutes', Pierre Noizat just Paymium has introduced a company to pay with real money, and the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
Cash also, however, these shortcomings.
Wikipedia major players, such as refuse to donations of this kind.
Others, such as the Blog-Plattform WordPress they will be accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir, and in Israel by Ron Dorit Weizmann-Institut the Rechnungsbuch analysed and shown that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November has been launched a 'Mega-Schlussverkauf'.
Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged 'welcomes', Jon Holmquist, for the company is working Coinabul Bitcoins converted into gold.
Pierre Noizat also, the author of a book on this currency is, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as Transaktionsnetzwerk.
Paytunia be system is a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone use but Bitcoin for the Validation of transactions, it is cheaper.
Moreover, the holder managed its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented in the traders, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
They simply need to give an address by a telephone 'and' recognised can be photographed, Pierre Noizat, the assurances that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend, in the hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems designed to be reviewed.
'It will be some time before Bitcoin 2013, but could be a turning point, "he predicted.
The ECB is in her report, moreover, the various, today as a highly prestigious risks in the event of a success of this currency.
We are deducted from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States should follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army the possession of their territory, and again that the Afghan people to decide their future, without all of us to expect.
We have, in particular the Afghan farmers punished, as we have seen it as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88, soldiers who have been killed and injured and Versehrten.
The Taliban are from foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers, who refuse to an armed foreign presence, as the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs and Tajiks, Uzbeks.
Sometimes tolerated, supported by the local insurgents, the latter will not be here when the Western countries to be discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, from a with almond trees replaced hill have observed the French loans, properly financed.
The of helicopters überflogenen lorry and Kabul Panzer-Konvois have achieved without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, it will not receive more of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time was Kabul empty and the country because of the struggles of the various inflammatory groups from the war.
Their accession to power was as a kind of liberation and return to the security.
The Afghan women have the price for the obscurantism of the organisation of al-Qaeda overpowered paid farmers, but their situation has not improved.
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan Government and current Taliban have a common desire to the women in a position of inferiority.
The most important figures of anti-Soviet war are 2001 to power.
They have turned into traders, by the government have them property confiscated, it is a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan to sell, and so benefit from the massive US subcontracting.
They have brought into disrepute, and most of them were not even take part in the fighting.
As I have heard it in the campaigns, the people want a government that is not from the thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, such as those who take advantage of the American contributions: the flight of capital is considerable.
The young people have of the war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran and Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years ago; Kabul has now 5 million inhabitants, what a fifth of the total population.
In the cities are the state schools full of girls and boys.
These young people who are neither the obscurantism of the former parties still want to return to the corruption of certain leaders, we must provide jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones, with its Turkish television series, the modern world, will be everywhere.
An army is now available.
The authorities will be, under whose authority they will be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of anti-Soviet fight are already making efforts to restore the militias in the province, which the power of the central administration.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities would have a certain degree of decentralisation the example of the Western nations should benefit, but through the abolition of the Office of the Prime Minister, since the Constitution of 1964, the US wanted to him a centralised State with a strong Präsidialgewalt.
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls, especially during the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country since the 1950s and long before dependent on foreign aid.
Industries have not been rebuilt, viable Stauwerke are not there and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything will be imported; apart from fruit and vegetables is not producing anything.
The private initiative is the priority.
In a country that was 30 years of war, would be a state control of the infrastructures have been necessary.
The rumour has been circulated that Afghanistan had immense natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground, whose to their beds.
Without energy, the iron or Kupfererz on the ground, or without means of transport for the export of the mountains is not a mining possible.
The Chinese have already almost Aynak copper mine of Mes leave, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) on the huge Buddhist site make their archaeological excavation and will remain the main employer of the province.
One day it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, of the largely dependent on imports and exports are normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French troops was concluded on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement is the continuation of traditional aid: girls and Jungengymnasien, Institute for French to the universities, French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural area, the support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service 'civil-military actions' of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), the 2012, in dozens of villages many voluntary work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and carried out by a small French NGO carried out that the ', in order to try to win hearts and souls' and the impossible task of the compatibility of aid and offensive action to achieve.
This work, for the numerous local workers were needed, can help to suppress the uprising, irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase the agricultural land.
What souvenir let us for military expenditure of EUR 2 billion back?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving the local conditions in these often in a more than 2 000 metres of the valleys are very hard.
In the message are dozens of written questions of small projects of communities of the province of Kapisa.
So that the farmers of the uprising by foreign groups, which led to its own statements your wish is the continuation, would be less well controlled directly affecting civilian aid to their benefit.
A constitution, with the way in Egypt
It is a new game of poker of President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt in relation to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily the unlimited power granted to him, more than ever, remains divided, it decided to put everything on a card.
To the surprise of all, he has announced that on Wednesday, the Constituent Assembly on the next day will adopt its final version.
Just a week ago the head of state of this House had two more months to the conclusion of its work.
Egypt is now for almost two years on a provisional, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and to a legal confusion.
This new initiative has only for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents remains the President in his' autocratic Delirium ', by breaking it continues to be' word 'and' the right underfoot '.
On the part of his supporters can assure you that it is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as soon as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.
A very short period, which obliges the Brothers, on their projects, the Egyptians the text section for section to explain.
For the President, it is also a way, its public and democratic legitimacy, during the protests throughout the country has been raging.
After the contrary, in an interview with the American Wochenschau Time Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Given that the Egyptian people with this resorting to a hasty vote an ultimatum: 'Either agrees for my draft or I reserve the unlimited power', the latter should after the adoption of the Constitution supposedly an end.
85 largely Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly have the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals is not done so.
Just before the Constitutional Declaration in the middle of November they have averted, because they believe that they do not have been able to make their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities, or of civil society alike have acted.
To achieve the quorum were yesterday morning in a hurry 11 people, deputy Members.
Some are very close to the Moslembrüdern.
It is not surprising that the Article usually have been adopted unanimously.
The commentators have found it amusing that the only difference of the day... in the late hour for the prayer expressed, because some Members of the body of the opinion that the Constituent Assembly Pendeluhr not exactly was.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, is from 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew attention to all, finally, identical to that the 1971 constitution and says that 'the principles of the Sharia the main source of law'.
The Salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped, 'the principles' by the rules to replace ', which would have made a stronger application possible.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not been changed, proof of their good will and for their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
'hypocrisy' say the Liberals, who only see this as Propagandaschlag.
Because, according to them is the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles.
They have in mind, particularly Article 220 of the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, particularly in relation to the review of the conformity with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Ägyptenspezialistin Sophie Pommier this is worrying as' the people who are asked to give an opinion, have not been elected and any democratic legitimacy.
It is this the first signs of a theocracy see '.
The fears of the Liberals will also be fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university much less than the current moderate should be.
'The is no specific religious commitment to see.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
The majority of lawyers who have worked on this text, but are not ulema, academics, some of which have been trained in the French system, "Alexis Blouet appeased a thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition writes.
But he acknowledges that 'in relation to the Article 220 some ambiguity may be available, because the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It relates in particular, on the 'fiqh' [Islamic jurisprudence, Anm. that Red.].
And in the future could be raised the question of to what extent Zivilrichter are competent to decide '.
In addition to his religious aspect is the text adopted yesterday greatly because of the far-reaching powers, which he criticised the President of the Republic.
The Moslembrüder argue that these compared with the former regime are reduced.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In line with the desire of the military the examination of the defence budget will not be presented to Parliament, but a national NDC.
There will also no ban on civil in military courts, as the human rights associations have called for.
The latter also share their concerns in relation to the text with which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, and serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, there is no article refers more to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
Their opinion, is the only positive point the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President yesterday evening on the television demonstrations had to speak, are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will March Saturday.

'The large and powerful' leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While Members and civil rights activist discuss what benefit the law on binding language tests for immigrants, criminals already act with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million migrant workers to Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Russia and other cities.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is, money for the maintenance of the remaining families in the home to deserve.
On 1 December, a law in force, according to which everyone working immigrant a test, the knowledge of the Russian language, must.
Until now, this regulation only for migrants, which in the service sector, in the local housing and retail want to work.
The tests should, however, with the time Föderaler Migrationsbehörde in the future for all migrant workers to be compulsory.
In this regard, we must not only language tests, but also tests in the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language proficiency must both for the conservation and the extension of the work permit be demonstrated.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is an official language.
Also of this law, the people are excluded from their Ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas before the break-up of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, the problem and protection of human rights
The whole of the Prüfungsstellen, under the aegis of the Puschkin-Instituts for the Russian language, the Russian University of the friendship among peoples, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can the tests in all the cities to have already been in Russia; more than 160 appropriate centres.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was of the Members of the State Duma and Federal Migrationsbehörde support.
Civil rights activist, however, before the entry into force of the law on several occasions in the press the following question: what will the whole thing?
What changes does the rule, language skills to have to show, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, however, the spokesman Migrationsbehörde is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labour.
'For many now talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers,' says the head of the representation of the Federal Migrationsbehörde in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Their rights must, however, already before departure be protected.
Only an organised recruitment is 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Confronted with problems of migrants without work, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without necessarily people with evil intentions of languages, which will tackle it under the pretext of aid in the dark, close shack, where he with dozens of his ilk months without food and documents persevere and 12 to 14 hours a day will exists.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
'In the country will give you the A promised, and the arrival of you will be deceived, have their passports and do not receive the promised pay', confirms the head of the headquarters for migration, the Tajik Migrationsbehörde Tolib Schwaripow.
Not complaining head!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who earn their money, not just that they do not speak the language of the country of destination, but also in their own language hardly in writing to express themselves.
Of course, this is not their fault, but the evil: only a few Turkmens and Tajiks, Uzbeks, too, can only sensible primary education.
Because in their families there is not yet even money to the children to feed them, let alone, proper clothing, footwear and Schulsachen to buy.
These children as a teenager then immediately take the first opportunity for making money.
'It is difficult without knowledge', to give them.
"You fühlst you humiliated and inferior. '
Civil rights activist stress on the following important aspect of the law.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, there are no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.
'Herzlich welcome' or 'Entry prohibited' for unauthorised
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy, in Russia, an official status.
Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
It also costs the legalisation of money: 12 to 16 thousand ruble.
A counterfeit registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents largely fabricated and we are not registered, and it then cases of blackmail.
'you are one or two hundred ruble for cigarettes and tea', is the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
'merely no cost for false papers shy'
Already on the day on which the law came into force, it emerged that not only the Registrierungsdokumente of migrants can be forged.
Some counterfeit certificates, which the completion of the language tests, have already been of staff of the Federal Migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen.
The counterfeit documents were printed with an ordinary Farbdrucker.
Naturally, the new owner this not in vain: every migrant who hoped that this will be able to save the tests, paid for the document thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the costs for the official test: this costs a migrant workers three thousand ruble.
The fact that the most immediate task is, the system to protect against corruption, so that the certificates not simply can be bought, are both officials and civil rights activist agree.
For the moment, the public authorities can immigrant workers, the first time by the test, only promise that it is time for a Sprachgrundkurs.
Furthermore, new arrivals without language skills offered jobs in areas where there is no active understanding with people is necessary.
Interior ignored illegal arms trade
Proportion of legal weapons to crimes extremely low
The Russian Ministry of Interior is planning a tightening of Waffengesetzes for private Waffenbesitzer.
The authorities to respond to the recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the run of the Moscow lawyers Dmitri Winogradow.
The police is wearing nicht-tödlicher ban weapons in the public and the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years raise.
The proposal, the chairman of the Duma-Ausschusses for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the amendments on Arms Act will shortly be presented to the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities' the problems through attraction want to combat the screws'.
On the Internet was an open letter published, whose authors - representatives of various Waffenverbände - demand that the authorities of 'senseless aggravations'.
The per cent of the crimes with registered weapons is very low, said, the Strafrechtler Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Interior Ministry were 142 crime with application of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period as a whole 1,168 thousands of offences were recorded.
The authors of the open Briefs are convinced that a tightening of the law for private Waffenbesitzer criminals will not prevent, on the black market.
Currently, we can, according to the authors in Moscow any weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior, stressed that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: of the factories to the officers
The weapons on several channels to the black market.
There are five such main channels, tells a former colonel Viktor Baranez, the ten years in the Department of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot a website, which adopts Waffenbestellungen
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons during the fighting in the Caucasus has been stolen.
'The weapons have been made both by the Russian officers and the Kaukasiern even stolen,' says Baranez.
At the second channel are illegal weapons, the Ordnungshütern of criminals are stolen.
Baranez explained that these weapons, both from the armouries to the police and directly of staff of the law enforcement agencies have been stolen.
Further arms sold illegally from military arsenals seem to come.
In many Militärlagern it was often explosions.
'There is evidence that it is in some cases of arson, in order to cover up the lack of weapons,' says the former military personnel.
Make a contribution to the black market in accordance with Baranez the arms manufacturers.
'Nowadays there are countless private Rüstungsfabriken, the international competition and therefore not withstand the weapons in the hands of the black market, for example in Moscow, squander', the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Particularly many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
'That is there a own, sometimes artisanal production and a mafia, the smuggling organised', the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts have calculated what proportion of each of the five channels to the supply of the black market with illegal arms around.
In the year 2011 was a report by the Centre for Problemanalysen and public administration.
The experts and analysed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and of the Federal Service of State statistics, forensic literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the issue of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons is, according to the investigators from the army and the Rechtsschutzbehörden.
Half of all weapons were there on the black market by the 'blame of those responsible in their work to do with weapons have reached', it says in the report.
The data of researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% thefts in the arms, and 5% comes from illegal archaeological excavation.
A Verkaufsberater a Waffenladens, not to be named, rest assured that weapons in illegal archaeological excavation be found, for a long time nobody buys, because they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more that traders in the supply to obtain a weapons cache.
On a Fähnrich will be a weapon, for example a gun Type TT, bought.
The weapon and will be issued by the fence.
'The traders brings the weapon in the city and sells them there for EUR 900 per with two magazines', he tells
'The police know, of course, on everything and, therefore, if the plan for the detection of crimes cannot fulfil periodic Kontrollkäufe dealers, the illegal arms', the offer Verkaufsberater.
'As the Luxusladen'
Buyers and sellers find most about acquaintances each other.
I had seen websites and blogs, as someone to my attention and I proposed to station 'Begowaja', where a person waiting to me, I would to a certain place where we would then the price could negotiate.
The price for the weapon I learned only there
Viktor Baranez Militärkommentator
'In order to obtain a weapon, I do need an acquaintance of contacts has told the Verkaufsberater', '. I voted as a friend, but I trust he not'.
There are traders on the markets, but we must go there and with a code adopt such as' of Ivan Iwanowitsch, the direction that the daughter has lost a tooth '.
I come now to some Schlagringe even on an acquaintance that I trust.
It gives me the Schlagringe also only because he knows that I do not verpfeife.
Newcomers are looking for weapons, in various ways.
The former military personnel Viktor Baranez tried in the 1990 ’ s as buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this issue.
The scheme have not changed according to him.
He was a Fotoalbum, in the 'everything' models.
'I felt as the' Luxusladen, remembers the military personnel.
According to the purchaser Baranez is not a pig in a poke, but everything can try.
I as a potential customers buy is not simply ride with the seller, but in the forests, and there we are a target on.
'I can then go there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we are negotiating with each other', which describes the expert approach.
From the shop Sofa
Internetsuchmaschinen search results show to websites and groups in 'Vkontakte', where arms', for various purposes'.
It will not need any papers there are still personal meeting.
'you only need the right amount of money', it says in the glossy magazine advertisement on the website 'Kampfpistole or rifle buy'.
There will be your orders to users and ask questions.
Will also be sold to minors?
'Of course, without a licence' asks users "Ivan '(direct quote).
'buy a' TT. Moscow, is the question of 'Fedorenkow noncommitted'.
The Federal Security Service, recently, and countless Scheinwebseiten buyers who want to acquire weapons, the service are crowding into the network.
As the people are hungry fish in feed and then end up in Siberia and coal schaufeln
Viktor Baranez Militärkommentator and former soldiers
I have heard from the scheme: the website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws are not applied.
The leaders are the orders.
The buyer delivers the money on a Bankautomaten.
'In answer it receives a photograph and a description of the Verstecks the weapon', the official press reported the non-governmental organisation 'Pravo na oryzhie' Dmitri Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stressed that we are to finish off, and behind bars, if you can be a question on a website.
The Federal Security Service, recently, and countless Scheinwebseiten buyers who want to acquire weapons, the service are crowding into the network.
'The people are hungry as fish in feed and then end up in the Siberian labour camps and coal schaufeln', he says.
For $100 a Makarov
The purchase of illegal firearms is, according to experts, with prices of USD 100 to 900.
According to Mr Dmitri Kislow of the organisation 'Pravo na oryzhie' can be a gun, type Makarov for 100 to $300 buying.
We must wait until to one and a half months.
The weapon is in military arsenals seem of overseers medium-sized rank spent.
According to the official statistics of the Interior, the number of offences with illegal weapons throughout Russia in the period between January and October 2011 to 7% to 22,9 thousand, while the number of cases exposed of theft and blackmail in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and devices at 7.8% shrank.
In the US strike Fast-Food- and Supermarkt-Beschäftigte
Every fourth US at young people sitting behind the coffers of's
In the last few days there was in the US to massive protests against low wages in branches of popular restaurants and Walmart Fast-Food-Ketten as's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy 's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yet no one can predict whether the protests still further swollen or whether they will soon be back to the air.
The protests are of trade unions and several left-wing voluntary organisations.
In addition to the increase of the modest wages of simple Walmart- and Fast-Food-Beschäftigten pursue the objective of the organisers of the protests to form trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy are not organized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called black Friday, which took place in the US sales, the millions of customers anlockten, which sometimes Handgemengen.
To this day, some Walmart-Mitarbeiter, of which there are 2.2 million in the world, their work and bestreikten together with trade unions and leftist activist branches of the chain, which is targeted at people are low and middle-income.
All the products sold Walmart, of children's nappies on Jagdgewehre and Autobatterien to Staubsaugern, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart-Filialen is on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the minor paid Walmart-Beschäftigten buy only on their own workplace.
The prices and the Warensortiment Walmart made to one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics often Walmart, according to the product can only sell so favourable, because the staff are poorly paid.
The latter are complaining about serious conditions, for example, the lack of forklift trucks or Handscanner.
The participants of the protests on the 'black Friday' wage increases, and they expressed their anger that the contribution to the betriebseigene health insurance from 30 to $100 per month has risen.
A typical Walmart-Mitarbeiter, the 9.5 of $an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company the average wage to 12 dollar the hour, it increased Walmart 3.2 billion dollars would cost.
These are approximately 1.1% more than they now for pay.
Would the wage increases Walmart fully pass on to the customers, every shopping in future it will only 46 cents more.
Per year would be for it, compared to today an additional cost of only 12,39 dollar.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it in only nine States to protests and that the company has caused any losses.
The black Friday took in its Laden from 8 p.m. on Thursday evening until midnight the next day, and in this period sold Walmart, approximately 5 000 articles per second.
As a whole, the Walmart-Kassen on the 'black Friday' almost 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the site of the left-wing Huffington post that as a whole 'less than five' Walmart-Mitarbeiter niederlegten the work and the action only 'another PR stunt' the trade union, the protests have been organised.
'Free' coffers.
The protests, this week in New York, where its aim, however, not Walmart-Filialen (which in this advanced city therefore not desirable, and are), but so far non-existent McDonald and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billion chickens, and yet they are granted not Krankentage, and you will not pay for your work honestly!
Jumaane Williams, a Member of the New York City
At present, the minimum wage in accordance with a federal and New York legislation at 7.25 dollar the hour.
The minimum wage in Fast-Food-Restaurants will gradually increased, but not too much, and on average have their simple staff in New York USD 8,90 the hour.
Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible, in New York, with so little money, is beyond me.
It was a time, almost a quarter of all US young people after school at McDonald's behind the Theke was, however, the young people still living in their parents.
Hardly a saw in that the main source of income or planned to continue to remain there.
I now face in interviews with staff McDonald's constantly people who complain that they do with this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there are in the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal, a comment, whose rapporteur points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if it did not know how they should feed.
The participants of the protests, on Thursday at 6.00 a.m. before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began in demanding that the cashier and cooks of Fast-Food-Restaurants a minimum wage of USD 15 the hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They invited to the education of trade unions in the Fast-Food-Branche.
The US law prohibits the corporate governance, this objective to stand in the way and trade union members abzumahnen or dismissed.
On the other hand, the management of them is not easy.
The establishment of trade unions in the Fast-Food-Branche is difficult but also for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Discontented
Loud protests in this day there were also many other Fast-Food-Restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the protests was an assembly the afternoon before the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including Stadtratsmitglied Jumaane Williams, who said: 'McDonald's, it says sell billion chickens, and yet they are granted not Krankentage, and you will not pay for your work honestly!'
The demonstrators were also of other prominent New York Democrats supports, for example, Bürgermeisterkandidat Bill De Blasio, who said that 'we should support the Fast-Food-Mitarbeiter together, so that they receive a fair wages and the economic prosperity, everyone can achieve the New York deserves!'.
According to the New York Times this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the US Fast-Food-Industrie.
However, were only a few hundred people on the ground, of which is far from all in the Fast-Food-Branche are employed in New York, in the tens of work.
It is not yet clear whether the spark will mobilise all of these protests masses.
'The brain is so far only moderately outflank'
The supporters of modern technologies purveyors of the enlarged will become a reality in the last time for usually through the lens of a specific glasses.
Google first presented in the summer in its annual conference in November, a working model was then known that Microsoft had registered a patent.
In conversation with the head of the Group for interactive 3D-Technologien in Cambridge in Microsoft-Labor Shahram Izadi, is clear that the lens of the scientists of the company was only a Durchgangsstation.
It rewards the possibility of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate and virtual Freiflächen create.
- Beschreiben you please briefly, what research your group.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the borders of this interaction.
So far largely, humanity is stuck in the phase in which to work with Pixeln Flachbildschirmen which sometimes also be affected.
However, we want vorausblicken 5-10 years and the radical changes of this interaction foreseen.
For example, are the Xbox-Konsole and the Kinect-Sensoren a step forward, and today will no longer be sold without Kinect Xbox, as all for movement.
- What we are still in the future?
- Although Kinect the interaction of a physical level, is playing a great deal still on the Flachbildschirm, sometimes in 3D.
The submission of information (the system more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been crucial.
We are trying to change that are working on genuine three-dimensional Darstellungssystemen on the basis of different technologies, including projections.
We must dismiss Computerwelt in our physical world and make it comprehensible.
It is required, however, that it is not only the users, but also its surroundings, will be recognised.
We could then the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first and foremost, we should be rid of these bescheuerten Virtual-Reality-Helme!
- What do you think about Sprachsteuerung?
It is popular, but will they not?
- you is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, because it raises questions about privacy, because we do not always all others, on its actions and intentions would like to inform.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers good, however, each in their certain niche.
For example, we in the field of governance of objects, in public places in a project in which we have with short and scarce, rather than with sprawling gestures experimentierten.
The gestures not by the Objektkamera, but by a bracelet recorded the movements of the bones and muscles registered.
It is still relatively large, could in theory, however, to the size of a wristwatch be narrowed.
But as a whole, however, is the future, for example, mixed Steuerungstypen Gestik and language.
- How this?
- We would you ask me, for example, to you this Sprudeldose rich?
They say it and to suggest at the same time.
Normally I say it simply.
- oh, that would be very difficult to see.
This means that you want to - that the users adapt to it, what a machine can make the relevant time, and what does not?
- It is not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we in the next time, especially in the development of new types of work will need to make it possible reactions of people in more detail.
This can be Lasersensoren for example in depth, as they offer a good resolution, which is very important.
- What demands you on the basis of your work with the Xbox Kinect-Sensoren to modern cameras?
There is a lack of disintegration, or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of the three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 Megapixel with a rate of 1 000 fps not bad.
However, the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In view of all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of algorithms have more work.
It must not only the unraveling along the girl and XY the Y-, but also along the Z-Achse be taken into account.
The speed and the number of the images per second are important.
The movements of people are extremely dynamic, and frankly, are the current 30 fps in particular for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a Berührungssensor with a regulierbaren Verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1% to 100 of milli-seconds for, with today ’ s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 and 100).
Not all understand how much the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I was just such a device, only without Berührungssteuerung and with more images per second.
- the number of the cameras Müsste not be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three 'cameras', with one of them actually a Infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of this is reflected signal.
And the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB-Kamera.
It is not used to calculate the Objekttiefe.
Perhaps more cameras could solve the problem...
Or the problem, because more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice Kinect-ähnliches a flexible system where we could play with various Kameraneigungen to see how we in the three-dimensional identifying a position.
- if I remember correctly, Google, Microsoft in contrast to his glasses not the public.
Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life the lens the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not always pleasant, on a smart phone in the hand, but I think the following: the tollste formula would be a 'rotating' enlarged reality, in which we have a cloud of the impact on the smart phone could tune
The lens is a personal 'gadget' and is its strength (private only you can see), but at the same time its weakness, because an enlarged reality through the lens prevented that you, together with others to virtual objects able to work.
- Let us a moment that the manipulation of virtual Hologramme in the air not only Mr Stark from Iron Man, but also human beings.
There is a problem, to the critics often out of this idea: there is no tangible response.
The hands of feel nothing!
What answers to your group on this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk of the fact that the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the taktilen perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage.
It takes pressure excellent true!
But there are also actually technologies, which are geared to the 'images in the air' to give something concrete, for example, the collision of some Ultraschallstrahlen addressed in a certain point, where the finger, a sense, but at the moment is so weak, as someone on the Handballen pustete.
There are also bands for the Commission on the nerve endings detect tissue injury in the fingers, that is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to the brain to outflank?
It think that it can feel that what it should, if it is just something?
- That is a good idea, as we have not yet been tried.
Here lies another task to which we will have to fight for a long time, namely a person physically in a closed area, to believe that it is instead in an open, virtually endless area; we are working on concepts with Laufbändern (other than in Fitnessstudios), mobile platforms and large bullets.
So far is only moderately outflank the brain, and we still have many hard work for years.
It is precisely this makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researchers thus attractive: many issues we are only at the start.
Instead of culture - rosbalt.ru own taste
Rosbalt, the project 'Petersburg vanguard', the city dwellers is devoted to the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the fine list, already high-level representatives of the Petersburg Kunstszene, whose achievements on the borders of the city and the often go beyond recognition in Europe, without the rest of Russia to be known.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill, Mr Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the in red clothed bearded, the one to Russian museum, to Sommergarten, sometimes in Szene-Treffen or Vernissagen them.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller also be issued, attract they large numbers of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg sozial-philosophischen artists, the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg vanguard the end of the 1980s, or the beginning of the 1990s.
It is also a man of the city and firework by its presence on the street its citizens a smile in the face and is causing them for good humour.
He recently schnappte a Drehorgel and became the Petersburg Drehorgelspieler, as it is for this difficult role in terms of its Künstlerdasein, its philosophy and its image was finally ready.
- Kirill, why are you actually always in red and not, for example, in Amber or Türkis in the city?
I have the red than fashion designers, the elected with the optics and the image.
In this world red is the compromise between artists, spin-doctors and society.
In the society calls for everything that differs somewhat from the Graunorm, aggression and bad behaviour.
But I want to by my provocations with the people.
Any of my last provocation was an invitation to dialogue.
- When wusstest you that you must be painter?
- In an exhibition in Kulturpalast Newskij, in my work were issued.
I realised that I must go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painters at the time to end, and new and free painter such as I was incomprehensible.
I am on friendly terms with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the 'Gazonewschina'; hence, 'Puschkinskaja 10', and then that was the first conclusion.
It is me to the theatre, to fashion, music, literature, except to all.
- And all the united in your Art-Klinik... - It was important to me, at the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best artists should meet.
In 1995, I have an area in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there to the renovation musikalisch-künstlerischen a club for the Boheme that the House of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and, I also remember string with its project 'Ucho Van Goga' go there.
String and his friends, simple songs for Play-back close Jersey, and was one of them also of mature composer Igor Wdowin today.
As the group, began to live to play, for their 'Leningrad'.
Trachtenberg facilitated many programmes before the time of 'Halli-Galli'.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began its great careers, but the foundations he learned with us.
Also the gallery 'D 137 of the club' or 'Griboedov' have their origin in Art-Klinik.
Were to our staff and Stammgäste.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still something.
In 2000 there was a survey in the press, in order to award 'personalities of our town'.
I won in the category of 'artists of the year, and so that I was at the peak.
It is not easy, in new times that old rules to work; I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the present time, it is simply, to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: it can be known, without a cultural contribution.
Your work - have a distinctive style.
- Many my images are real gems and clearly the topical and acute the idea.
I will be an exhibition with the subject of 'The Russian museum as a clown'.
Clowns are timeless.
I was previously socially, but now it pains and fear, to be the case.
In a clown blurred all this, and is losing its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have preposterous ideas.
We save the world, for example by making that everyone has fully to dress up.
Now all respects to the clothing and is based on the Outer and not at the heart of the people.
But perhaps we should not give a people, but it should in the face of biting.
The deceit disappear by the dress up.
- Before recently we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - A City of Culture should have a hero.
Who, if not I?
Commercial art - can also be nice?
Commercial art - Nowadays there must be careful, respectful and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
Previously, the people: the large groups Bohemiens loved one and the ordinary people.
There is now Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to all.
I am no Einhundert-Dollar-Note, which everyone likes.
Now you must consider, whom you will have fallen.
Now everyone has Kultstar roughly 100 supporters.
- On the appearances of Stas Michailow but several thousand.
- On him are abandoned women, there is a role the sexuell-soziale sphere.
For cultural reasons are 300 people and not 10 thousand, consequently, there is less management, money, and everything is based.
I voted in favour, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy the achievements.
In my youth I have painted such images, at a gathering even in a number of the works of, Falk and Larionow.
I started with images, which normally only at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there is often misunderstandings.
It says: intellectual culture and culture.
Consumption has absolutely no culture, that is something quite different.
I am a man of the last culture and grew up with artists in poverty and lived in poverty died and refused to raise money.
This is the culture, which I am in favour.
- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- the best be cultural experts.
It says: servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real tsars it was different, because the tsars understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
What we have in St. Petersburg, the experts could, but they will be barred hochrangigerer experts, because it is for the former and properly evaluate them open the way.
Now is only the own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that it honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore other museums must seek.
- What is for you Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow; there is much more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones can art difficult to grow up.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more than readers and writers, that is not right.
In Europe, there are many, people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
We are much less.
Art must again be modern, so as to the beginning of the last century.
The project will be from grants the town of St. Petersburg financed
Birth in outer space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or clash with Killerasteroid.
By guiding caravans from spacecraft with Erdbewohnern on board, on the search for a Ersatzplaneten.
In order to save humanity in the, is the important issue, as we are in or on the Ersatzplaneten breed?
Many choice I believe that there are not.
De facto there are only two real planet, we could at least the hypothetical inhabit.
'namely Mars and Venus,' says the scientific staff of the astronomical Sternberg-Instituts Vladimir Surdin.
But, while the conditions on Mars comparatively build enjoyable, there is on the surface of the Venus, a temperature of 500 level.
Life would be only in a great height or in orbit Venus, therefore, possible in space.
The question of reproduction in the first of all researchers in terms of the flora.
Already half a century before that have been carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation in orbit bred peas differed not in any of the abasing worldly species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, in fact by tiny fruit (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979 Wachteleier have been sent out into space, in order to explore how the zero gravity on the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal chicks.
But it is then the problem.
'The problem is that the chickens must be stopped; it must be on its feet and start to move', explained the laboratory officials of the Institute for medizinisch-biologische slice, Vladimir Sychew problems.
Without firm underground, the chickens have been falling over themselves in the wild.
Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn completely.
The chicks not reacting to light and Laute.
Four days later they will then simply died.
We were chicks slip 'twice and the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them', Vladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chickens in space.
Brutkäfig the last 16 years ago with animals flew into orbit.
In the spring 2013 will continue the experiments.
However, on the Biosatelliten Bion 'only' same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats fertilized into space, which has already been sent.
In principle was nothing special.
'That was precisely with the Biosatelliten, but once again, it was only a single experiment, and the research should be continued,', says Vladimir Sychew.
After landing received the Weltraumratten offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space, it has not yet been resolved.
The task is difficult.
Animals from their natural habitats, can simply be taken out their Fortpflanzungstrieb not follow.
In contrast to the animals could the person in principle.
Homo sapiens is able to abstraktem thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations are not such experiments carried out.
But women fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk, there were in Tereshkova.
The Wertvollste that mankind is of the female body.
Our Möwe flew of them, and no one on earth can answer the following question: would it survives the Weltraumflug?
Will it, after this flight bring a child into the world?
Nobody 'Finally answered this question,' says Raumfahrtveteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June in 1964, only a year after their Weltraumflug, gave the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a subsidiary.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also militiamen.
In 1988 brought forth the second women in the space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, which twice in orbit was, and even work outside the Raumfahrzeugs leisure, a son.
Nevertheless, there is a risk.
We have only very few a cosmonaut, after long flights everything went well and they were healthy offspring.
'The more, the more dangerous, it is even on flights into orbit', concludes militiamen Valeryi Poljakow, a hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, the human race for new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the produce of artificial Gravitation.
In the Hydrolabor Vorbereitungszentrum the cosmonaut is a compulsory station during the ground.
Here in a state of flux win the cosmonaut routine for the work in the open space.
The water, the zero gravity.
Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a strange surroundings; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander testimony to that of the lives of the Ocean turning to the country.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is approximately 9 months in the stomach of the mother Fruchtwasser, and that it easier to get used to water.
In principle is the logical, as after birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks pass.
'It is too little time to forget,' says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child the zero gravity is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In the state of the zero gravity is the enormous Beckenmuskulatur Bauch- and quickly, and this is also the ability to extract the child.
Well, we deal by geburtseinleitende tool.
The birth could, for example, in a Spezialkammer, in order to extract the child.
'But what happens then?', is the not insignificant question by Valery Poljakow.
On the other hand, also needs the child artificial gravity.
Without the Erdanziehung to feel, can the organism the skeleton and muscles not train.
A newborn child can in orbit not as an adult for training in a Belastungsanzug.
It is simply the lack of his life, which is of fundamental importance.
'This experiment, which together, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, will mean that we have a disabled people, a completely unangepassten will bring to the world,' says the head of the problems of the Institute for Bioethikkommission medizinisch-biologische slice, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in outer space mere hypothesis.
But they will eventually become reality if the people in their spacecraft to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in space.
NKÚ-Chef: control of the failed Schwarz-Systems by fault of the policy
The Czech Republic, in connection with public contracts on good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, however, is in their application.
In conversation for Aktuálně.cz says that the Vice-President of the Supreme Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Mr Miloslav Kala.
'A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I think that this is not the case with us, "Kala comment on the current situation.
A similar outcome is also appears to have a common control by Czech and German auditor.
As a negative Praxisbeispiel it introduces the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for the so-called 'Schwarz-System'.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS the entrepreneurs not trouble with controls - is the system is now banned or permitted?
'A law must have its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, then surely cannot simply Regierungsvorsitzende, and this one, whose duty now even the monitoring of compliance with the law is, in its work', is hindering Kala.
At the meeting of the Temporary Committee of the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a common tschechisch-deutsches project, in the framework of the laws of both countries on public contracts have been compared with each other.
What did it because in practical terms?
It is a parallel examination, with which we have started around two years ago.
Simply put, it is important that the European legislature to establish how to handle public contracts are to build on the national legislations. And finally, there is the real practical application.
All this, we have compared with each other, and although the examination is not yet completed, we were extremely interesting differences. In general terms, are the laws we are perhaps even a little 'strict and perfect', the actual application, however, is in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more precise rules. We must also with the actual application of the law.
How can you help the project? what is for you for this project?
It is precisely such a common control could help us that we stop constantly to an improvement of the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this is obviously not particularly positive.
Efficiency means that a matter to a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
It is perhaps even so that we in this way the system only with excessive paperwork "burden", and those who seek loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold is higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Vergabegesetzes.
As is the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority, as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
What the authorities is concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ the Federal Audit Office that is built as with us and also on a college, which is only slightly different, will be set up. In principle, however, similar to work both authorities.
The powers are comparable to a certain extent, with Germany, however, a federal state, i.e. that it is these courts of auditors in the individual Länder - it is different from the German system of our.
The only receives BRH must monitor what is in line with our public funds.
Public resources which are of the counties, and communities are administered, let there be subject to control.
What the German legislation is concerned, is the easier than our?
In general, I would like this without any definite indications only compare. Nevertheless, Germany, in some ways, often described as a model, but it certainly cannot say that Germany in particular, is better.
This is perhaps remember that the auditors are better?
This certainly not, however, as I said: comparisons of this kind may I do not particularly like to.
This is still be noted that, those countries which are a model for us, also with the problems.
Otherwise they would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, is it not?
What the Czech legislation, what significance for your authority, the revision of the Vergabegesetzes feel you have any impact?
Given that this new directive is only a short time in force, is it not yet in our assessments.
Since our controls afterwards, we must take place here with a degree of delay.
We have more impact felt in the preparation of future controls - as we have the new control 'identification of risks of inefficiency' introduced and with this almost 14, public contracts examined and analysed - this will, of course, the amendments, because the thresholds change the conditions for certain types of contracts were among the modified
You see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption.
It can, however, the problem, that the rules' strict 'and not be more can be met.
Under the previous rules are a test unterzogenen people to the agencies (for example, in the event of an operational programme of the Regional Policy, the Regional Council) to be accountable, so that any breach of the Vergabegesetzes a violation of the budgetary discipline.
However, it is then even stricter sense, the law?
I do not think that in this way.
The system must exclude those who attack and to abuse the system, and not penalise those who a formal errors committed to the actual decision-making not.
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
We say first of all, what is not successful.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called 'Schwarz-Systems' would be helpful, what exactly does this mean?
Is the Schwarz-System now banned or permitted?
A law must, but its application, and if something is forbidden by law, then surely cannot simply Regierungsvorsitzende, and this one, whose duty now even the monitoring of compliance with the law is, in its work.
He can say: 'We change the law and allow the matter', but he cannot say that we act as if nothing would be.
The procurement law which owes much contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is for the protection of public competition also correct.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the contract with the best offer simply because of Formfehlern is excluded.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is what I believe that we are lacking.
On the roads there is sometimes Eisglätte, mainly, however, they are dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic is partly schnee- and Eisglätte.
Most of the roads are good, however, this is sometimes increased caution.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad were the streets of this morning there was good line, and occasionally schnee- Eisglätte.
Temperatures fell to -5 until 10 ° C, during the day it should be a warmer.
In the region or snowing it is now no longer, and in the deeper Höhenlagen is only a thin accounts.
On the Kämmen of Erzgebirges are, however, some 30 cm snow.
According to the Bezirksstraßenwacht there was a restrictive view of fog.
The motorway R6 and the infrastructure of the first Straßenklasse in the region are now fully line.
Attention is, however, for example, to build bridges, on which the lanes sometimes frozen and smoothly.
This all transport routes are also the second and third Straßenklasse, including the Bergstraßen.
On these roads, however, remain vereiste or ausgefahrene Schneereste section by section.
In particular in the higher situations is therefore increased attention.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads Ostböhmens there is danger because Eisglätte, in higher positions and in the mountains is on the roads sometimes even a ausgefahrene Schneeschicht, shares the road and Autobahndirektion on their websites with.
The driver from Eisglätte Straßenmeistereien warn, in particular, in higher positions in the district Pardubice can arise.
It can to Eisglätte in particular on routes of the second and third Straßenklasse in the circles, Lanškroun Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I / 43 and I / 34 are treated in Svitavy chemically.
Snow, particularly on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the mountains Orlické Hory.
A ausgefahrene Schneeschicht is in Höhenlagen on the roads of the circles Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
It is now largely in Ostböhmen sunny or resilient, and it remains largely niederschlagsfrei.
Temperatures move between -3 and + 1 ° C, it is a weak wind.
District Pilsen
The roads in the district Pilsen are well line, locally is, however, increased attention, and the driving is to adapt to the weather.
This is on the morning chill wind, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed and before the temperatures, it can then fell on the streets to Eisglätte.
Local is also with fog, with the point of view, however, in today will improve.
These are data from the Bezirksstraßenmeistereien.
The motorway D5 – is fully in line, increased attention, however, recommend the Straßenmeistereien between the 80th and the 131. Kilometres.
The lanes of the first Straßenklasse durchgefroren, however, are mostly dry.
In the south of the circles Pilsen and Tachov, however, it can to Eisglätte section by section.
The lanes of the second and third Straßenklasse are damp, and therefore also applies here the reference to possible vereiste sections.
Drivers should mainly on the less used roads in the area to be particularly careful Bohemian Forest.
District Olomouc
Drivers must reckon with Schneematsch today, in the direction in the district of Höhenlagen Olomouc are travelling.
After the use of Schneematsch Streufahrzeugen remains in the passport Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
The Straßenmeistereien nächtliches Schneetreiben forced to use, in the circle Šumperk fell according to the Road Administration about 3 cm Neuschnee.
In the other areas of the province of the traffic lanes are fully in line.
'In circle Šumperk Schneereste still remain at high altitudes in the Himalayas.
In the passport Červenohorské sedlo drivers have to reckon with in the direction Jeseník Schneematsch ', said a staff of the Road Administration Šumperk ČTK today to the Agency.
Their colleagues in the circle Jeseník in the night, according to their data are the streets and in the chemical treatment Höhenlagen after free and wet.
In the circle Olomouc the roads are fully line, in the circle Šternberk must, however, the drivers in Waldabschnitten careful, because the lanes as wet.
District Ústí nad Labem, district carried out by Liberec
In Northern Bohemia Straßenmeistereien the several bad navigable road.
In addition to several places with snow or Eisglätte is the mountain road of Telnice after Knínice in the circle Ústí n.K. according to the traffic police.
Temperatures will also remain deeper situated below zero, so that the snow and ice on the streets. From the Tiefebenen sixty miles south east of Böhmischen mountainous, in particular, are no problems reported, and the roads are usually dry.
So far are not reported traffic.
Eisglätte will, in particular from the radius of Štětí reported.
According to forecasters have there been in the night ideal conditions - during the day rain and melting snow, in the night wolkenloser sky and frost.
Of the main lines, as well as from the roads I / 13 on the border of the counties be carried out by Liberec Ústí n.L. and poor transport conditions.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary, because of the branches of the Schneelast have been pushed to the trunk routes used.
On our concerts Šimon Ornest: we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about that, in less than a month ago the end of the world should take place?
This is one of those Katastrophenmeldungen, on which we so like to people can start up again.
With our band The TAP TAP make us more about fun and say that we are the only band of the world, which have sufficient positive energy can gather, in order to prevent or stop the end of the world.
In December, you also achieve a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you imagine our readers closer to the project?
It is a nationwide Benefizveranstaltung, which we are already two years.
For this, we want to use the Maya-Kalenders Marketingpotenzial, whose end to the 21 December at 11: 10 a.m. is predicted.
The day before, in other words on 20 December, from 21: 00 p.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and of Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is about to be the time, on the Pacific island Kiribati, in a zone of 12 hours before us is the Maya-Kalender ends.
Who is criticising this idea?
Originally from me, then we have the idea, together with our Grafiker Honza Augusta.
In this connection, we would not only to collect sufficient positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to reflect together with the public about the state of the world even our children.
At the end of the Maya-Kalenders we also have a unique range of shoes, t-shirts, pockets and Schlüsselanhängern against the end of the world, with their purchase on www.e-tap.cz us also support the people.
The band The TAP TAP, together with other actors also known as the anthem against the end of the world with the title 'end of the world falls from'.
Already today, the anthem on YouTube very popular. It will also on the Benefizkonzerten being proposed?
Of course, very finally, provided that everything works and the end of the world is not happening...
The anthem of all the actors at all three concerts at the same time be sung.
Furthermore, the anthem together in a Direktschaltung by the Czech TV broadcast live.
The text of the anthem by Tomáš Hanák, of the main character of Jesus, also plays in Videoclip Xindl X singing with...
How are you to the cooperation with both come?
We also cooperate with other figures in the Czech world, which related to it that we have many Benefizveranstaltungen and concerts realise...
We are trying to these people in our projects.
It has transpired that the most interest in working with us, and to have fun.
What purpose, the proceeds of the concerts benefit against the end of the world?
For the establishment of a barrier-free Bildungszentrums Studeo, on which we are already six years, together with the club TAP in Jedlička-Institut work.
The students are regularly Jedlička-Instituts of teachers who help them with different leisure activities.
As the students themselves do not have the resources to the teachers, quite frankly, we want to help them in this way.
In the completion of the Jedlička-Instituts is to create a separate buildings, in which we then with this project.
In any concert are several groups and performers.
You have that the criteria selected?
We wanted to put together a programme, which addresses all generations, including children.
For instance, in Prague, Support Chinaski Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You know anything further on the website www.kpks.cz.
"similar" large-scale events are also planned for the future?
In May, we are for the first time in the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing a very interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to see in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we then in the United States - this would also like to with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their Auslandspläne are not just small, so far you are already in Madrid, London, Brussels or in Moscow.
The TAP TAP is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How to address you this travel logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it appears at first sight.
Five of our Members are wheelchair users, i.e. the need to be transported in wheelchairs Gepäckraum. We must also, of course, many Instrumentenkoffer and different luggage mitschleppen...
Nevertheless, it has always worked, without problems ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared to us that I am sometimes surprised have already partially.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your foreign trips you have a comparison, as in the individual countries with accessibility, as they deal with disabled people, etc.
As you have seen these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, in which everything works better than us, particularly in Russia, we were witnesses that in the East, everything still in its infancy.
Moscow to Prague for the disabled is absolutely not. It is still unusually, if someone in a wheelchair is travelling alone in the city centre.
It is there not even, of course, that you have a wheelchair users, for example, in the lift vorlässt.
Fortunately, clubs, there are also trying to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect, we need to the more developed countries catch up?
There are still many things, in which we are lagging behind...
There is still to note that an improvement of the situation also always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities self-employed in the public space, go into a museum, toilets can use, etc.
But it is not usual that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social affairs, we are with the band The TAP TAP the West a bit ahead!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only if our ranks significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, are the things that really begin to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willensstarken figures.
The TAP TAP is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: what have you in the year 1998, a bond motivated to set up?
At that time did I, as carers in Jedlička-Institut, where I met many young people who were interested in, with a little hard.
And since I am playing Saxofon musicians and, among other things, I, together with a colleague a Musik-AG established.
Well, and with the time is that, as our host, Láďa Angelovič, to say, somewhat out of control (laughs).
It was known the bond but only in recent years, or I am wrong?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers has helped; we have also started actively for us to promote.
We are aware that, if something is to the outside world and this is not to see their own performance in a sense, does not exist.
Thanks to the EU grant money we can also good teachers, high-quality equipment and operation.
It was your objective, it with The TAP TAP so far?
From the outset I have the potential felt that we can address the situation is different.
In the show business today often copied a the other.
That is on its way logical, as anything new taken with caution and only after some considerable time will be accepted.
There is only a few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that, TAP TAP is one of them.
The first impression of the spectators has usually is, of course, compassion; this is only, of course,...
But this compassion is totally superfluous, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned beings, which we regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities, something that not only for themselves a step forward, but for the whole of society.
It was for this success helpful that you are a strict head, as one of many people listening?
If you would like to make something good in many things, we must not compromise and must also demand a certain degree of discipline.
I believe that this is completely normal.
Some come with romantic ideas, and then, when they discover that they have tested twice the week, stages and must overcome, sponsoring concert tours spend a lot of time, will cease to the enthusiasm among many quickly.
So it works but everywhere, in each band, the serious work and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The TAP TAP twenty members.
How many of them were from the outset, in other words since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go. This cannot be prevented.
Anyone who has the will and the desire on Mitmachen with us, is always welcome.
Will take place on the day before the end of the world, Thursday the projected 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
Venues are: Incheba-Arena / Prague, Fléda / Brno and Plynojem / of Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and further musicians
All three venues will conclude by Live-Schaltung interlinked and it erklingt a common interpretation of the anthem 'end of the world falls from' the band The TAP TAP.
The aim of the Konzertes it is, the funds for the provision of a multifunctional disabled Bildungszentrums to find that, under the name in Jedlička-Institut STUDEO in Prague should be created CZK cost: 25 million.
The entry of CZK costs 400 children to 12 years, are in charge cards Vorverkauf in Bohemiaticket available.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency - as a Member of this Space zwanzigstes. Poland is so that the second Member State from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was ESA-Mitglied on 12 November 2008).
Poland began in 1994 a close cooperation with the ESA and participated in the following years in several ESA-Projekten.
The path of Poland in the space began, however, much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space sector, which is not always understanding.
I would remind you here, for example, the presentation of A. Šternfeld of 6 December in the Warsaw Observatory 1933, in which the author of ideas from its pioneering Kosmonautik 'to' presented.
The ideas of the young engineer (another. 1905), the audience, however, cold, and after years, still Šternfeld that only Dr Jan Gadomski interest shown in his work.
Šternfeld won the year in 1934 Kosmonautik 'for' entrance to the of Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch gestifteten Prix REP-Hirsch.
Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important supporter of Astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines published he wrote several hundreds of articles and books to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis of internationally recognised contribution to the development of space has been appreciated by, among other things, that one of the crater on the side of the moon erdabgewandten after it has been appointed.
Already in 1925 a Eisenbahn-Draisine has been built in Poland, for which a Raketenantrieb was planned.
The author of the text and the details of this project were unfortunately unknown.
It is not even been clarified, whether the missile taking-off or on the brakes on the Draisine should be used.
The information on this come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 began with the Polish infantry raketenbetriebenen munitions.
The research, the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Professor Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the traditional documents is clear that the research to the stage of practical tests was reached.
The research was then, however, by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht suspended.
In 1937, appeared in the press of the originating. Rohoziński message draft fotoelektrischen Jagdrakete, and in the following year, the work 'Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza' of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of Raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war were all projects to military use of the suggested by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) coordinated.
The committee was set up in 1937, after two years of work, his work, however, the war ended.
Other articles appeared after the war on space travel thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society will take place in 1954 in the Novemberausgabe the magazine Problemy, in the four major article of the space.
The article by Professor M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a Raumfahrtgesellschaft.
At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the research of space future.
Already in its inception in 1956, the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft a PTA accession to the 1951 established International Federation for space, and indeed the PTA was already in the autumn of 1956 proper a Member.
The following year was the first PTA-Vorsitzende, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space.
This office, he had, until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 the PTA participated in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1 has been completed, in 1957, the first start on 10 October in 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1 800 metres around 80 cm was long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built, and in the Błędów-Wüste Flugtests 1959 began with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The missile was 1.4 m in length and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further stage should already be able to make real scientific work - the missile RM-34 should an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the monitoring of Höhenwinden.
In 1962, however, was the further development.
Successor of the first missiles of the type RM was in the years 1962 to 1965 developed Meteor-1-Rakete.
The missile was conceived as Zweistufenrakete their overall length, and the take-off weight 510 cm was 32 500 kg.
Three types of this missile have been developed, and (Meteor-1A -1B -1C), which each other, in the size of the Transportraums for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport area, with 0.4 litres to be legalised, Meteor-1B on 0,34 litre and Meteor-1C on 0.62 litre.
The maximum altitude, in all three types of 37 km.
In the years in 1965 until 1968 was developed in the Meteor-2-Rakete Luftfahrtinstitut, whose first Flugtests began in October in 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kilograms and was able to 10 kg applicable in a level of around 60 km.
Then the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 being built.
It is also worth pointing out the accession of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, on the two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR-Ausschusses followed.
Poland participated in the framework of the Interkosmos-Programms also in the space with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second Interkosmonaut.
The lifting of the law on voluntary work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court on the law on voluntary work.
This decision, in the public, a lively debate.
It is certainly interesting, the issue from a wider perspective.
The liberal oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition.
In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and of the free and unrestricted movement of private capital with unbridled financial speculation, which goes hand in hand.
Because of the major differences of the value of work (wages), it is to Preisspannungen.
Under this concept is a state to understand, in which the manufacturer tried, through import cheaper goods in the economic competition, by making the labor force 'competition', to make a greater market share to usurp and to increase its profits.
In large measure does this mean for the majority of companies to relocate their production abroad to buy or favourable, or to abandon their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since the private sector will be no social responsibility and, therefore, no responsibility for the rising unemployment, it caused is necessarily the government spending.
This situation will be strengthened by the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the overall economic and social damage caused to replace.
This situation is generally known, so that specific statistics on this point are superfluous.
The predatory practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to engage in competition with each other, to the social level of their own population and thus to artificially reduce the country to attract foreign capital.
In other words, the governments provide its own population without regard for the social consequences of the private capital.
This manifests itself in particular in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures, it is, to force its own population, the dictates of the private capital, especially in terms of to accept.
This is happening on the one by economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other by the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result, the growing poverty, and ever greater differences between rich and poor.
In Germany there have been for some years, public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for poor people are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people is already in the millions.
In the wake of the increase the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases where workers receive such a low wages, that the state to increase their income by the subsistence level.
Such a scandal has also been in the case of the German Bundestag employed workers exposed.
The austerity of practically all EU-Südstaaten will no doubt at the same situation, with the people under the pressure of a disastrous crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate (as in the nineteenth century was the case), or for a pittance to languish on the fringes of society and hope that eventually private investment will flow into the country.
Here is, of course, the question of where this capital?
If it from another EU country, is only the poverty of a country to another; or capital is altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees working for a fraction of the European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the state with capital in its own economy must be involved, and that planned economy to economic disaster.
The private capital narrow-minded insists on its position that the state has not lenkend must intervene in the economy.
But then we have to ask whether the capital, the policy and therefore the whole state in their own selfish interests or even influenced.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all Member States.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual benefit, a legislation, in the criminal practically everything, but nothing is a punishable offence.
In Germany is the situation so that a lack of finances Staatsministerium private, with the industry interdependent Rechtsunternehmen with the drafting of legislation.
This draft legislation then have to be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence is not more popularly, as the western constitutions, but of strong financial groups, which prefer their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies are quickly in a situation, as they Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar and Pompeius' describes: 'The State was long since the break-up of, and the posts are occupied with violence.
Against bribes, by unlawful fraudulent use of advantages or stone and sword.
The corruption wucherte incontinent, and the people with already buy votes to vote '...' people with nature bewarben not for posts, so that the state as a result of this decline eight months had no consul '... "It began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation is an autocracy, and that a strong man should be chosen'... Appian thought to Pompeius admittedly, but the strong man was eventually Caesar, the democracy permanently by the dictatorship.
As is apparent, is today's society as well as in ancient times to the reckless preference of the own advantage, without on societal interests.
The private sector is already by its very nature, not in the situation, the advantage for the whole of society to recognise and enforce.
The result, today, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, which is not the slightest concern for deeper reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore, in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th century.
The current state of view, the fall of this regime in favour of liberal democracies, be regarded as some pause in the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today ’ s elites in future the loss of hundreds of lives, the humanitarian and social catastrophes, we witnessed already today, and the crimes against humanity, as we in the older and more recent history know, in total ignorance.
The lifting of the law on voluntary work is not a solution, at least no lasting.
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition, will the Czech Republic, also continue to be forced to look for ways to the social level of the population to push down.
This trend is therefore bound.
The only solution are targeted political and social reforms that the equity of the state of the economy, increase the influence of citizens to the government and the monopoly of private capital increase in the society in favour of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"... that nothing from violence, or ever could emerge 'sings Sting in song Fragile, whose main verse the refrain is:'... so that we do not forget how fragile we are '.
'When my sons no wars, there are no', says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mr Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in the year in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a huge number of responses.
Some are behind Israel and argue with the right to self-defence, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the other hand, support the Palestinians, argue with racism of the Israeli State, with the genocide committed to the Palestinian Arabs and call the State of Israel as a terrorist.
At this point I would like to write about who is not in these recurring waves of killing guilty and who were victims; at the end of today ’ s inhabitants of Israel, including the Selbstverwaltungsgebiete born in the current political situation and have not seen the violence began itself.
I am talking about the readers look behind the scenes to open the context of whom the 95 years of tension (from the Balfour Declaration in November in 1917) in the small spaces country in the Middle East in particular.
My thoughts are based in part to accessible historical facts, others are of this nature and go from my own understanding of, who or what the group of people the events of the modern history significant impact on.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less evidently, the question is whether it really always these figures were certain autonomous their steps behind the throne, or whether anyone was, of their actions on a vorbestimmtes objective.
We must admit that we live in a time of the wealth of the world in the hands of fewer of individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power is not within the life span of a generation.
Under these astronomical rich families is a particularly, which could be described as head of octopus have (I do not know whether someone is on them, I support this but not from) - the Rothschilds.
Much will not written on it.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was of the Rothschilds already in the 1990s of the nineteenth century, bought the link with its name hochkriminellen action to prevent, in whose background is the consolidation of their power, the reproduction of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are nearly all the central banks of the world, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or equip itself to this (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall Ghaddafis only remained four, with Russia in the meantime, its central bank of the Russian Government has implied).
Whoever has sought to face up to this family had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank to renew started during the civil war, their own (read: state) notes and 1865 issue was murdered in a theatre.
Kennedy J.F. began to publish their own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed, he was murdered in 1963; the honourable Member Mr Mc Fadden in 1936, after he was poisoned the Fed for triggering the global economic crisis in 1929 wanted to sue.
The global appetite the Rothschilds, 1859 - 1871 in the years to the formulation of a plan to unleashing of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemasons of the 33rd and highest degree of insight.
The first war had the aim of the major monarchistischen Staatenwesen of Europe, to eliminate the second war in particular British colonial rule should be broken, and the third war is the world's population to approximately 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number of their benefits and its luxury and would also not so many resources to create a Universalreligion consume) (of ecumenism here is nothing more than the run-up to), and finally to the adoption of the absolute power.
The method by which the Group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top is initiating a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (or from chao - order from the chaos).
But these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Federal Reserve, so that crises such as the of them in 1907 triggered not repeat).
After it by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the First World War, destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded Germany ’ s capitulation (for the destruction of the Russian Russian empire, the war was not necessary), then, the dissolution of the Central European superpower Österreich-Ungarns.
At the Second World War easier to spark, the bankers by the policy to create a latent conflict by Germany with gigantic Kriegsreparationen documented; that they created the condition of impoverished masses the Germans, so that they only have a sufficiently strong leader unterjubeln the culprits named and simple solutions offered; another factor was the creation of a multi-ethnic state Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which the role of a fifth column should take, and also the Kriegsbrand.
At the end of the nineteenth century the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement of a branch of the creation of a Judenstaates sought, as far as possible on the historic area Judäas with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration has created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was first clashes with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler of the chain broke, on the international bankers had initially thought, or whether it was only after plan is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and, as well as through Kriegsreparationen against Germany the ground for the Second World War was preparing, the proclamation of the State of Israel the creation of the Brennpunktes for the Third World War.
If the international bankers will succeed in this war is to unleash the Jewish people in the Second World War, similar to the victims in the front Kampflinie, this time, together with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think how strongly the people of supporters and opponents of Israel, to divide).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only wrong in an endless cycle of violence, while at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
We must here between the inhabitants of Israel and its leadership distinguish, but the international bankers in Israel, just as with us, the people, exclusively in their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a faschismusanfälligen, the international bankers loyal by politician, is doing everything to ensure a war with Iran, which in view of the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), rapidly to a global conflict could extend, and in which it because of the control of Iran on the only 2 miles Strait of Hormuz, on the 20% of global oil supplies, to destroy the global economy.
In the light of the fact that the words David Rockefellers from the year 1994: 'The only what we need is an over-arching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order. "
In its presentation of the new world order is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of Finanzaristokraten.
A world in which every newborn in the birth of a chip be implanted of this nature of the total control.
'And it is that the small and large, the rich and poor, the Free and servants all a Malzeichen to give their right hand or to their forehead that no one can buy or sell, he was because the Malzeichen, namely the name of the animal or the number of its name.
Here is wisdom, anyone who has the minds, obviously, the number of the animal.
Because it is a number of people, and its figure is sechshundertsechsundsechzig '.
The film Argo: if 's worst, Hollywood of Justice
In November 1979 occupied a mob Islamist students demonstrating the US Embassy in Tehran, 52 and diplomats as hostages.
For their release they requested the extradition of the ousted Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, after the revolution in the US had fled, which for decades on the regime ’ s policy seems certain to be respected.
For the American Government, there were no positive outcome from this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah, since this is the confidence of its allies in other countries would have severely damaged.
At the same time it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime has resulted, the release of hostages.
It was a serious blow for the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to retrieve made it even worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released for 444 days ago, after negotiations by the Algerian Government had been given.
The fate of the hostages to home, a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer sentiments.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film director of the Argo and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history, the United States, a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the message was six Botschaftsmitarbeitern the flight.
This ended after many complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; helped to bring them a flamboyant story to Verdeckung to its true identity - they were travelling with Canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, the supposedly in the country visited Drehorte for a science-fiction.
Combination of Genres
The experts' for 'Exfiltration, Tony Méndez, developed plan also made the necessary cooperation Hollywood.
So that the camouflage was credible, article published on this film in peer-reviewed journals, press conferences held, and the fictitious Produktionsgesellschaft had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a particular combination of several Filmgenres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic Politthriller, at the same time, but also a so-called 'Caper Movie', i.e. the history of a successful Husarenstücks such as the film Ocean 's Eleven.
This change in the film Stimmungsebenen - on the one hand the Dokumentarszenen from Teheran (in the contemporary ikonische be Titelsequenz photographs shown, and also in the Filmfassung the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and therefore easily be taken to its extreme.
And then there is still the scenes from the CIA-Zentrale and other institutions - men in suits on Besprechungstisch, on the Amtsfluren, on the telephone...
Ben Affleck with this film is a remarkable start of his career.
From a belächelten actors is a respectable director, and also as an actor, it is now no longer the aim of ironic comments.
ARGO is his third movie The after the whodunit No childsplay (Gone baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, which is not in the soil Boston of the director.
The sense of the atmosphere was one of the place to the characteristics, which the previous films this film director, the standard Hollywood abhoben.
Affleck proves this sense, however, also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "'will be played.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place - the Eingangssequenz the storming of the message is in its clarity, and gives very impressive, the feeling of Verwirrtheit and the unpredictability, if that happens, somewhere the history.
A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong Filmstab in a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much to act in too many places
The director had also to reflect that the history is not many in the cinema sense exciting scenes.
With the little but he is working quite successfully, and the reality sometimes rather nachhilft - then what is not always so elegantly works (the scenes, in the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone call in America is averted, or the chase on the runway, somewhat curious).
The weakness of the Argo is too broad spread by the need, too much to act in too many places have to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood-Mitarbeiter very charming, their figures but would have more areas deserves, and they are in the film far not alone.
Afflecks a film is losing traction. It is a film, with some interest and the shaping and to a thriller reminiscent of the 70 years Retro-Stil can approve.
However, it inspires enthusiasm difficult.
As a reminder to a until today, in some way of living of history and as proof of how excessive but the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, however, he is sufficient.
Directives for the Aufblasen by balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, of an annual survey on the oddest bank charges course, has decided this year, the competition 'most absurd regulation or idea from the EU-Werkstatt'.
'At this idea has brought us the recently by the EU's plan, a 40% quota of female representation in the management of large European companies', said to introduce Patrik Nacher to the organisation of this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
Under the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of Versicherungstarife for men and women.
Until then, women in life assurance enjoyed an advantage for the insurance companies, because it objectively less risk.
'Other incredible incursions from the EU-Werkstatt can be nominated by the end of this year.
The real vote will take place by the end of February 2013 ', with shared Nacher.
On the controversial regulations is including the mandatory admixture of bioethanol on fuels, in its wake, naturschädigend is that of the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because this is a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes, or the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen in this year, because of the eggs were much more expensive.
Criticism of chickens in the past, the de facto ban the use of the term "butter 'or the sales ban on conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 centimeters long
The EU machine is often under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule of one or several Member States (such as the Czech Republic is trying to be represented at the moment, for example, also with Veto-Drohung to the demands of Czech banks).
Lobby-Interessen were also behind that bananas of the highest Handelsklasse in the EU at least 14 centimeters long and must be 'no' Krümmungsanomalie are allowed.
The European Commission is defended with the argument that it merely harmonisiere the fragmented national standards that would impede the trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables, the EU against the opposition of some countries already weakened by pointing out that the existing directives to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this poll is perhaps the EU regulation of last year, in accordance with balloons sale with the reference to that children under the eight years Luftballon aufblasen not without supervision of an adult.
The EU citing an American study in accordance with balloons the leading cause of the suffocation of children.
A similar restrictions already applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There is also curious incursions home
Relatively absurd is also a directive, the European officials themselves - everyone in the EU must adopt an official function, because of the sensitivity of the matter for Greece is not the name Macedonia and must instead use FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies in the field of a Member State.
The EU, so that the Höchstvolumen to Lebensmittelvorräten, on the day of our accession to the area of the Czech Republic are.
The Czech Republic, for example, the volume of crossed then set for Pilzkonserven, for which we have a large fine threatened.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or of the idea of funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were, however, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
'We are disadvantaged by this that we have no sea.
We will be reimbursed in the EU to apply ', said in the autumn of 2004, the then Minister for Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument he gave was that the grain harvest has been very high and the state as a result of the so-called Interventionseinkäufe overcrowded camps.
As the Czech Republic to sea ports have another way, the EU should, according to Palas hundreds of millions of euros of us pay.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, after all, so far that it is an invitation to tender, on the purchase of cereals from countries organised, which have no access to the sea.
Funding for applications for aid provided to the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development, under the leadership of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically, it has to be the means for the establishment of Fördergeldanträgen act in Brussels.
EU regulations are the exception: bizarre
Regulations are in the Member States, the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulation and, hence, effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserves, according to some experts, however, more recognition.
A serious problem, in view of these experts rather the EU grant money for projects, absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of European integration have in common, but when the budget negotiations have been forced by individual Member States.
Emotions here also calls on the fact that the Czech Republic, similar to other Member States in Brussels about the right to use of specific indications and traditional products have to fight this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic has been for a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, the term 'Olomoucké tvarůžky' defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský we), whose tradition in US up to the 19th century, however, in our manufacturers' Tuzemák 'names.
The name of rum must only be used for products from Zuckerrohrdestillat, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU in the society of the world-famous feta cheese and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or Parmaschinkens now also of Karlsbad Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer hops.
With a EU-Marke can as the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or the Hořicer roles.
'The people that I want to save the Republic, but I am merely an amateur' claims Okamura.
Senator, as is the idea, for the office of President to stand for?
It is not my intention, Senator or to be President.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would get us anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic since 20 years will be plundered, as thieves free, while the people of the taxes and the retirement age to be increased.
I had no ambitions, politicians.
But when I see something, what I do not like, then I am trying to propose a solution to change this.
And since I am already over 40, and that independent and parteilos, I have no other way to influence the things, as for senator or the President to stand.
In the Senate, you have managed, and then straight to the way in the Burg.
You will not turn our backs on your voters?
I have said all the time that I have the fight for the Burg after the result of Senate shall include.
Later, I have this clarified and said that I stand for the office of President, if I am elected to Senator.
My aim is not the role. The role is an instrument with which I can implement my vision.
For as much influence and I do not need a strong mandate.
The difficulty, but not only that we, as people in the pub and the television, but any, the change anything.
Come to the media, which is a wish to deprive the honour, and the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
About me that I was claimed, for example, journalists would be bribed or that I was Jiří Paroubek advisers.
We are talking about your vision.
The fight for the Burg, you have with the position of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retrospective Vermögenserklärungen over 20 million kroner.
You have to change legislation.
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can table legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizens, I have campaigned for the tour guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded policy - if someone from the right or left with a good proposal is rejected this deliberately, and the population only on.
As an independent parteiloser I do not have a far greater potential, support from all parties represented in Parliament, to win.
My advantage is that I and without Schubladendenken Parteidogmen from every party that is what our country is the best.
You see itself as a person in the policy, rather the left or right?
From Czech point of view, it seems to me that the left me rather see the people.
For me is this Rechts-Links-Denken but completely irrelevant.
For me is important that we can make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone to the left or right-wing camp; I would like to combine the people.
I always support public any good solution, even if these KSČM or of the ODS, and as I am against bad ideas.
It does not like you, if someone you described as populists.
But can you confirm this, what you have just said?
If you draw up a business plan in a company, then you will have a Idealziel and a vision.
And this would like to you.
This can be as call populism, but all the proposals which I have referred to work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without the support in Parliament you remain mere buzzwords.
And so that you come in the policy in the long term, not far.
Or do you think that you, if you only long enough with the people, will be able to talk, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and the public and to try to convince them on our side, in order to secure these goals.
As President, it would be not a problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties to live on television, the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors to the statute book.
And if the Angesprochenen would then have to say why they reject it.
A strong personality, which refers to maladministration can exert pressure on the political scene.
If you take only once the direct election of the Presidents, which was a credit to the public pressure.
I would like to say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius still an intellectual.
I am trying to allies for my views and vision.
With the politics, I have only just beginning and try, for my programme to find the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the situation itself; and if it does not work, then I am sure in six years in the private sector.
That sounds a little, as if Okamura the Czech Republic should save.
I am not a savior.
I know that nothing can I alone; that is why I voted with a number of famous people talked about, whether they do not want to stand for the Senate.
I have spoken, for example, with Radim Jančura, however, in work.
I have also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, the fraud in trade with ease of fuel oil.
My candidacy I began with the premise that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.
Sixty per cent of voters are not at all to the elections, and the, who have left, have often elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two Independent.
People have such a Senatszusammensetzung elected, that changes only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and Bezirkshauptmänner.
Do you think about the creation of a own party?
I have not yet considered, because I do not have time, the past to check every potential Parteimitglieds, and certainly do not have the money.
I still have not even money for the Präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent accounts are only 20 000 CZK.
They have no money?
They are talking about Vermögenserklärungen, what would your?
I appreciate my private wealth to around CZK 60 million.
I have a property in Prague with a value of 25 million, a home for approximately 10 million, a further for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth approximately 10 million, and a Ashton Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, approximately a million is worth. And then I have a few million to the bank account.
The Ashton Martin was a Kindertraum - James Bond liked I have always been in the car, as he went to gallantly, and at the same time, women were fought against the evil.
They drive a Ashton Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money you do not want to invest in it.
That is not convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
I have to make debt?
I have already 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my programme is not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to the campaign own means.
The costs for the campaign will in fact, covered by my salary as a senator.
But the Senatorengehalt I could not live alone; I could, for example, my son not the English school finance, the 30 000 per month.
If I just wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.
You will remain so further work as entrepreneurs, in order to have your living?
You said that you did not be cut back these activities?
But this is not with the level of salary.
As promised, I have my activities partly reduced.
Thus, for example, my deputy director of the travel agents in the spring.
The people want to see me as Samaritans, of the Republic of saving.
But I also have to live by something.
Monthly income on which you were used as an entrepreneur?
Around 200 000 and 400 000, and that is still so.
As President, I would however, my undertakings.
The full discussion, you will find in the Samstagsausgabe of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real spirit of adventure are - not only in mind the example of Spijkenisse and the newly-created Bücherberg - 2 photographs
'I think the buildings, it is much futuristic, and finally, there is something interesting to see', says Lisette Verhaig, a roadside Passantin.
Stefan Spermon IT technicians and, in a nearby corporate sector, says: 'But, nice it is already the House'.
But I wonder what we still need a library.
All the Internet, and E-Books iPad.
No one is still in a this Old-Style-Bibliotheken voluntarily, or?
Spijkenisse, a little besichtigungsbedürftige Schlafstadt at the gates Rotterdams is strange record holder.
The 80.000-Einwohner-Gemeinde, the lowest Bildungsrate the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid fact, it was decided a few years, to education and the seven fictitious bridges, on the Euroscheinen, as depicted beautiful bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen.
The success of the pool in borders.
And so did the Stadtväter that the only way, the statistics Mr: a library must ago.
Winy Maas by the Rotterdam Architekturbüro MVRDV, master the foolhardy Balkendiagramme and producer of witzigen, and often, cynical buildings, the matter with his usual calmness and, in 2003 with five books Wettbewerbs-Hearing the arm and a grin in the face.
And while the jury is still intrigued to, and with the 'Transparent zuckte, stapelte the impudent Maas his splendid Mitbringsel to the size of a pyramid and ended his aktionistisch well-founded speech with the words:' My Stadtgemeinde! '
It is, therefore, my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million expensive Berg aufgeschüttet.
It is part of a Revitalisierungsprojekts, to the underground car park, supermarket, postal services and a few neighbouring housing and tear with a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg with the second price 'Best Library of NL 2012' excellent.
Moreover, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award for 2012.
That is the faceless Kleinstadtretorte which, hitherto, has not had to offer more than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly town hall, behind its white facades it would be inclined to suggest a Molkereifabrik a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, Spijkenisse now on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under glass.
There is admittedly a lift, through the middle of Bergmassiv, but the real regional and Lesefreuden the tap fußläufigen climbing the topography.
The totally verglaste Innenraum is bright and transparent, gun-shy Klinkerboden and the elegant lights clearly speak the language of a public Stadtplatzes.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
It is already looking for Parkbank, the dog and boys and Mädels playing football.
Books and everywhere, books, books.
'We usually the's bookshelves along the façade, and in the centre is a large, dark areas, which mostly uncongenial and impersonal way is,' says Winy Maas.
We have the classic Raumkonfiguration on its head and the Lesebereich of comfortable inside out.
The interior is Bücherbergs shrewdly: in the middle are offices, Internet library is, Schachclub, environment centre and Haustechnikzentrale.
A particular pleasure, the black's bookshelves, the times Wandverkleidung, sometimes Brüstung, sometimes Stiegengeländer.
Optics, are alien to Haptik and smell.
Even die-hard architects and Civil Engineers shake whether of the unknown Baustoffs the head.
'We wanted to work here with Recycling-Materialien ", declared Joop Trouborst, in the project manager Stadtgemeinde Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And we are in a friesländischen farms operating in a fitting one day waste from the agriculture.
For many years, we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and in fields as a millimeterdünnes Kunststoffvlies Wurzelunterlage.
That is cheap and zeiteffizient.
The slender textiles is one, two Saisonen, then it is ready for the Sperrmüll.
For the library was the fleece carried - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimetres thick plates squeezed.
Under pressure and Hitzeeinwirkung verfärbt the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogenous, belastungsfähigen material that a bissl for new cars and a bissl after Sportschuh smell.
After 105 stages is reached at the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 metres long used in Literaturcafé we will not only with a fantastic prospect of the city, but also with Dutch Kroketten eingetopften Ficusbäumen and rewarded.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right Luftfeuchtigkeit in Literaturgebirge.
Donations for the new soul
'You do not believe it would of course, but this House is despite the many Glasflächen a flagship project in terms of ecology,' says Trouborst.
Heated and cooling, geothermal energy.
Although the Bücherberg under a Glassturz is, it seems that the sun, even in sunny days only briefly Interior.
The broad Holzleimbinder, the right to be outside glass, serve as Beschattung and begin a large part of the sun.
The Raumklima is very pleasant.
Do the rest fully automated Rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptics from the IT sector, dared already the way in the new library.
Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM-Lehrerin Cynthia Bogarde, even as the Boekenberg Spijkenisses' long overdue soul '.
The reason: the opening of a few weeks ago was invited all residents, a book from his personal stock.
It is for the time being the optical gaps in the not yet fully bestückten library - currently 70 000 of them - be filled.
The concept is clear.
The shelves are filled by obenhin.
'nothing is worse than a half-empty library,' says architect Winy Maas.
'I think that thanks to our invitation has now of all inhabitants of a certain relationship with this new House.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
That is those Königsdisziplin MVRDV we have succeeded in the jargon, the European identity.
Spijkenisse Literaturgeschichte has written.
As young and uneducated it may be.
That is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: 'Germans need to make a greater role to play'
Germany has in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine to abstain.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, balanced Berlin to a narrow diplomatic level.
German wave: the beginning of the week, Germany had first signals that it against the request for observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then abstained Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have not done in Gaza.
Germany must now given its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it was not the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstained when it came to a no-fly zone.
Finally, this has been implemented by the NATO.
It is difficult to Germany on important international issues a clear position on the subject?
Yes, it is true.
The reason is that it is precisely its foreign policy, surrounded and away from a policy to pay by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.
This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are found in other words, between the fronts.
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I believe that they are still in its role, but they are on the path to a 'more normal "foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as France or Britain.
What does' a normal "foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to national interests to adopt positions, which are independent of which the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy of the economic policy is motivated by the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ’ s economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
These economic interests have influence on the position of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
That is why it must be careful, the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries not to offend the.
This plays a role in any case.
But I would also the not too much weight to want, that is not wholly unilateral relationship.
But it is definitely an important role in German considerations.
Germany has damaged its relations with the US, by abstaining when important decisions, for example, in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, there is great understanding for the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this is such a dramatic rift was, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany so that even a certain respect einspielen.
Because it signals but that it will be taken seriously as an international player and its interests should be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions to the Palestinian initiative.
The United States have been clear for a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of the American domestic politics have these differences which exist.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government can, of course, this position publicly not represented.
I believe that the real differences are not so great as they always appear.
If you turn to the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu Obama is not so upbeat about by Netanyahu ’ s policy.
It is Germany difficult, his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other side?
I believe that this is what makes it difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, a little easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case today.
So they can not part of a broader and foremost, and must instead be things from their own position.
That they do precisely with the euro.
I believe that in future, Germany will play a leading role, Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Is Germany itself in the role as an important international players - Germany wants to play a major role at all?
Or is still difficult for the leadership of Germany?
Germany is not accustomed to this is still an unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is the country still difficult to a greater role to play.
If we look at us, for example, the euro crisis, because every time, when Germany has a greater role, various anti-deutsche feelings free.
This makes it the Germans not easy.
This is the old problem: you want not be surrounded by hostile countries.
So, Germany is seen in a much more difficult position as the United States.
There must be sensitive to various neighbours and opinions and this is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy, the EU continually fill the vacuum but not at the moment, who is otherwise?
The Germans will simply need to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it is inconvenient for them and they still much less popular, c'est la vie!

'protection of trademarks' in China: if Puma Armani and suddenly be Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind it is a in China, which officially registered designation, however, nothing has to do with the Ursprungsunternehmen.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection, as long as the actual Lord who brought not complain.
And even then, is not clear whether they are right.
'It is always more difficult for foreigners, to protect their brands in China, "says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer in the sessional services Taylor Wessing on Schutzrechtsverletzungen specialises in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The rich Nachahmern is already a few additional letter, so that they register their brands.
So, instead of simply from Gucci Lu-Gucci Prada-Kny Prada, we register.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturers Puma.
Pattloch opens up a file with registration of the Community Trade Mark in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, there was a Chinese company the trademarks Zegna DF Puma protect, a somewhat synthetic label, which is also the Modehaus Ermenegildo Zegna used.
The Chinese world champion in copying and the injured intellectual property, is well known.
In the large cities, there are mehrstöckige department stores, the almost exclusively counterfeiting sell.
Pattlochs cases but are different: on behalf of his clients is it that Chinese companies from the Trademarks Agency, officially, the right to use a term, the already elsewhere is protected.
The Chinese call this' bang ', a Beifahrermarke Mingpai.
The word is' Dakuan bang '.
So that women are meant, the rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame
'This is to deprive, we must combat', it calls for Pattloch.
'The brand Alleinstellung watered down, which will disappear, the damage to their image is enormous.'
The financial losses and the litigation costs of the industries affected are in the millions, especially where expensive Vorzeigeprodukten.
According to the Marktforschungsgesellschaft CLSA is China with a volume of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But erased dubious entries in the Markenregister are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
Up to nine years, the proceedings drag on, with uncertain results.
Pattloch reported of cases in which prompted the court cases, because after the long term the beanstandete name of "reality".
If the plaintiff must have the misfortune, he even Plagiator pay money, because it violated in China, whose brand Pattloch says.
Sometimes, there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also relate to graphic elements.
2009, Daimler a legal dispute with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany, that companies, which recently took the German Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister.
The Chinese must therefore use an emblem until today, which resembles the Mercedes-Stern.
The Volvo-Käufer Geely used was originally a blau-weißes logo of BMW reminded; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.
The Modehersteller Lacoste lost in China against counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous Crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The Trademarks Agency CTMO in Beijing is true that there is 2010 for personnel and Raumausstattung bottlenecks.
Last year was however, of the 'emergency situation in getting returned to normal life'.
It is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals by 22%.
Almost 57, 000 such cases have been completed, 75% more than the previous year.
However, still waiting in the office 81.500 objections to carry out.
It costs a lot of
As so often in China are impressive.
Last year the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for protection of trademarks, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that China on the tenth time in succession the list of Neuanmeldungen in the world, shares the authority with.
This also applies to the existence of all current trademark 5.5 million, as a whole.
2011 are 1.8 billion yuan to charges have been taken.
Simplified, that means that any notification, on average, or yuan 1280 costs EUR 160.
It is costing many times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
Although the Germans, whose illegal manufacture of imitation Kraftfahrzeugteile has been closed down.
But secured the counterfeiters continue to the Chinese rights of the brand Freudenberg.
We have failed to do this, as in Germany family name could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademarks Agency CTMO, the opposition of the Munich because also back.
In the next two bodies Freudenberg was right, but the Prozessgegner is fighting to further today.
We must watch your step
Now is the matter before the Supreme Court of Justice.
Wentzler is confident that the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: 'The procedure is extremely expensive and will cost us much time, money and nerves'.
The internal costs would be difficult to quantify, the Firmenarchiv even have a hundred years old files must go, in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago was Freudenberg the other side in vain for a 'high six-figure Eurobetrag' to the settlement.
', it is very much reminded us how much is worth,' says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East zurückzuschwappen even threaten to Europe.
Then, if there imitators vulnerable brands.
This was a Chinese manufacturers in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business, the company, yet he has long since been abandoned the registration.
'You must watch your step,' says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies, in doing business with China to be very careful.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather the foreigners' everything that somehow is worth protecting, even in China 'register, as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact: if Freudenberg in the last act of his Markendramas too, then we should probably the other side to pay royalties for the own behalf, declared Wentzler.
Or we will be in question from the market segment.
AIDS Day and sing help:
In Heidelberg probt the chorus Imbongi - and in Swaziland, children orphaned by AIDS.
The history of a link, the far more than 8733 kilometres.
First the us making all this noise: Cowboystiefel, Basketballschuhe Damenpumps Herrenslipper, and look to the Parkettboden find the pace, it quickly.
Eins-zwei-drei-vier.
Only then thresholds the voices of the singer slowly - old, utterly, tone and Sopran - press, and pursue betören.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old a conductor, it almost from his Stoffschuhen, if it brings together with his elastic wild gestures.
It is on Monday evening, in the Musikraum of the Institute for Medizinische psychology in Heidelberg probt the chorus Imbongi a new song.
In the fifty Sängerinnen and singer arrived, between 23 and 69 years old, of the Humangenetikerin until the householder.
'Om' Obani 'is not a simple way, every Chorstimme has a different text and this also in a foreign language: ethnic Zulu, the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
In the world, there are around 34 million people infected with HIV, the estimates UNAIDS, the programme of the United Nations to Bekämfung of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland live 245000 children orphaned by AIDS.
More than 40% of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 children orphaned by AIDS in the village Esitjeni, the club Voices for Africa godfathers found in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, we can take a sponsor.
It guarantees the child Schuluniform school fees, and every day in the warm meals Gogo-Center.
Imbongi means to ethnic Zulu Geschichtenerzähler or Lobpreiser.
The fluid Bantusprache can speak in this area, but no one.
For almost ten years, the chorus of songs in this foreign soft language and brings them from time to go back to where they originally come from: in the South Africa.
As the crow flies 8 733 kilometres of Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni that the voting power of the German Chores depends.
Forty per cent are infected
Approximately 2 000 people live there, some still in simple Lehm- and Strohhütten, a large proportion of whom are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents more, because these are the HIV resistance.
In Esitjeni is reflected in the small, which is suffering from quite Swaziland: high HIV-Infektionsrate, lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Restrictions on the male Vorhaut, the risk of contagion demonstrably by half, will reduce the population of barely adopted.
More than forty per cent of people in Swaziland bear the Immunschwäche-Virus, with the middle of thirty to die is not uncommon.
In a common Afrika-Reise in the spring of 2005, the chorus of the village, but above all saw the Imbongis many children on the roads, which not only to parental responsibility, but simply to all: food, clothing, education.
School without qualifications in a poor country has certainly not a chance.
Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals, for a few euros in the year a child to school and to send him a warm meal a day.
But was already a year later, the chorus of the club 'Voices for Africa', since almost professional the Aids-Waisen in Esitjeni.
Facts to sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually-transmitted diseases?
To the bacterial STI, count syphilis chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Frequent viral STI, HIV, Humane Pappilomaviren, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filzläuse and Krätze are among the parasite TSIs.
Who are the Hauptbetroffenengruppen?
Tripper syphilis and, above all, in men, the sex with men.
The Robert-Koch-Institut assumes that at least four out of five of all in Germany notified Syphilis-Fälle through sexual contact between men.
In the heterosexual adults are Chlamydien-Infektionen, Trichomonaden, Candidose (fungus), Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren often occurring sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is comparatively small adults under heterosexual here, however: around 20% of the new to this group.
Among young people are Chlamydien-Infektionen much more frequent than in other groups.
After European surveys relate to three quarters of infections young people between 15 and 25 years.
Here, also come Humane Pappilomaviren in young people often.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation.
The number of Syphilis-Infektionen, according to the Robert-Koch-Institut of 1697 diseases 3698 diseases in 2001 to more than doubled in the year 2011.
The number of new, since 2007.
2011, there were around 2 700 cases.
This is about a tenth of less than in the year before.
What symptoms point to a contract?
Infectious diseases can ulcers in Genitalbereich, complaints to the, a product, and urinate Unterbauchschmerzen Bläschen or Warzen.
Often, however, they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect itself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion to offer protection, but not a 100%.
Because, in part, can cause of sexually transmitted diseases also by Schmierinfektionen and close just be passed on.
Therefore recommend experts in particular often changing Sexpartnern regular check-ups.
Early diagnosed STI the majority can be cured and have avoided.
By godmothers, donations and not least the Gagen, the chorus throughout Germany ersingt, is a great deal together.
'All in all, we have already around EUR 200 000 sent after Esitjeni,' says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the associations.
In the village Zodwa Dlamini even managed, a self-confident and durchsetzungsstarke Mrs, the money from Germany.
It is also looking to ensure that the orphans, in a particularly good example of the Grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women on ethnic Zulu CITES are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in, giving them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms every day to schooling appear on time.
Anyone who has more to come into Schutzhaus Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club, as well as the two cooks, every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Moreover, 'Voices for Africa' a Nähschule launched two Hühnerhäuser built and together with the American health arrangements PSI organised, that many in the village a HIV-Test have.
This is not a matter of course, because obviously the disease in the whole country is, it remains silent they prefer dead.
A king with 14 wives
'AIDS is an absolute taboo Annette Lennartz,' says, 'because it has to do with sexuality.'
Strange in a country in which the King officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch King Mswati III, sub-Saharan Africa, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state sanctioned way of life that the HIV in the last few decades has spread so quickly.
But also the many migrant workers, the virus around the country.
There would be free of condoms in every corner, Annette Lennartz says, 'but which are hardly being used.
Culture is a different - flesh to flesh '.
In order to promote the cultural exchange, the two, three years Imbongi-Chor all jointly by the South Africa and singing songs of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, the many on the southern bit of the black continent even in times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in a black language - as much recognition is not only mood and pleasure, but has also been some grim border guards a few tears abgetrotzt.
The journey will always lead to Esitjeni, where the singer their godchildren visit.
Even though the small village on maps, little will take place in the valley of Ezulweni-Flusses it is more than known.
'Is after Esitjeni, as is the light' say the people there.
And if we consider the crow flies 8733 kilometres for Heidelberg return to the stampfenden singers in the Proberaum Bergheimer in the street, then we see it as well.
Messenger, NASA discovered ice in the Mercury has continued
Has the messenger probe is proof that it is on the planet Mercury has continued to hold.
The ice cover will perhaps be up to 20 metres fat.
The US-Raumfahrtbehörde NASA, the existence of ice on the planet Mercury has continued.
Although it is the closest the sun, there are some frozen water, as from three on Thursday in the 'Science' Fachmagazin studies published.
The Tube messenger have found evidence that, in the region which is permanently in the shadow of the planet, the ice.
This is at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 metre thick.
The water was probably of comets or possibly also in the Mercury has continued to the asteroid, are taken.
No one would like the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in context, said the Chefwissenschaftler the Messenger-Sonde, Sean Solomon.
Can the temperature in the Mercury has continued to achieve by 426 degrees Celsius.
But the discoveries could help to clarify, such as water and other building blocks of life in other areas of the solar system.

Our insights into space telescopes the most important:
The telescope 1608 by Hans Lipperhey to be invented - even before Galileo Galilei Sternenbeobachtung a year later on.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes increasing - and the insight that they provide, deeper.
30 years, namely of 1947 in 1975 was the Hale-Teleskop in San Diego Palomar-Observatorium close to the greatest Fernrohr the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Telescope Binocular.
It is equally look into space of two mirror, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner workings of Gran Telescopio to recognise the Kanareninsel of La Palma, is enormous - alone the mirror is 10.4 metres in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save money.
Nevertheless, it is a diameter of some eleven metres.
Detriment of the favourable construction: the telescope is in his Höhenwinkel us - and this in its flexibility.
This too is in Höhenwinkel Hobby-Eberly-Teleskop in Texas.

Here it is an illustration to gaze at.
The most important impressions from space, however, does the Weltraumteleskop Hubble.
Since 24 April 1990 it already provides pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, is seeking the Weltraumteleskop Kepler after extrasolaren planet - mainly for such, the inhabitable.
On 2 February 2011, from NASA announced that 1235 Planetenkandidaten since Missionsbeginn have been identified.

Scientists assume that the South Pole of the ice Mercury has continued to exist.
However, there is no reliable data, since the messenger far closer to the North Pole for the planet.

Many people in the south of Azerbaijan achieve a biblisch high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A Spurensuche in the country in which 97-Jährige are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch-Gebirge is wildromantisch.
The Kleinbus rumpelt kurvenreiche on the street, densely forested hills, rivers and simple Bauernhäusern reißenden.
Everything is green and stiff, one might think that it is in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres.
Here, the Caucasian the Talyschen that not much is aware, except that they perfect Persian and Aserisch speaks and very long-lived.
Final destination is Lerik.
The small city flaunts to greedy wuchtig architecture of Soviet times, which are not in the picturesque Berglandschaft to fit.
Tourists come from Europe, here too onerous is hardly the capital of Azerbaijan Baku.
We need for the 323 kilometres of eight hours, because the road is only one-sided.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is here in the province of not yet arrived.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that the stuff Lerik to tourist attraction.
'Baku was in May with the famous Eurovision-Song-Festival - and in the next year we have here a festival of the oldest people of the world', says Fatulayeva.
It is the Director of the Museum of longevity, is the only in the world.
This is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, the older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a Schwarz-Weiß-Foto.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years a child born
But more controversial Star the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, 168 years old.
However, there is not a ’ s birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented people, 122 years old, seems Müslümovs age but extremely dubious.
'1805 when he was born here in the region, in 1973, he died' Fatulayeva explained.
The man is three times have been married and have 23 children, in the age of 136 years he should have created a daughter.
So has Şirali Müslümov in his age in order to build a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, on Max-Planck-Institut Altersforscher in Rostock, has from the very elderly in Central Asia.
'striking many hochaltrige people, there is also in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza-Tal in Pakistan,' says Scholz, 'also live in Sardinia extremely many very old men'.
However, due to lack of documentation is no scientific evidence on the age, given register.
Every day becherweise geschmolzene butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik a remarkably often biblisches age.
There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why are so many hochbetagte here in the South?
The Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains the with the special genes Talyschen.
Museumsdirektorin Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that it is in the diet.
But that it should be the kalorienreiche Talyschen as healthy diet of the meat, bread and milk products, above all love and many of which daily geschmolzene butter drink a glass, seems from a nutritional point of view it is not plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, the young people? in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city, Lerik Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With their 97 years, it is for these regions still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims, 143 descendants have to live in a simple Holzhaus, which is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground with a Butterfass they relentlessly herrollt back and forth.
Eight people live under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Two small children around jump.
In the kitchen is preparing the guests tea, in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu-Gläsern.
Mirzayevas White teeth are in perfect Reih and link, under its headscarf dunkelblonde Zöpfe long, they hide their son proud before us reveals.
I have my hair always with milk laundered, and I never kept their colour.
'shampoo I have never used,' says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
It has always only the ate what of their own Court came, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I do not have a single time in the supermarket food bought.
Then they are told by her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was it in the period after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the 'beloved father' Heydar Aliyew took power.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouths of an old woman.
But the cult of the father figure of the nation is being driven his country as a dictator, knows no borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, later took his son, Ilham the helm.
After all, there is no need of Azerbaijan ’ s elderly.
230 Manat (approximately the same amount in euro per month), receives Mirzayeva as pensions, for here an amount which we live.
And perhaps also has long been Mirzayevas ergrauter son right: 'The Old enjoy in our culture of respect'.
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved to be invested and are happy.
If this is not a reason, as long as possible to stay alive
The word 'human rights' is missing in the Constitution
The revolution is returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo, show the deep division of the country.
The future Constitution with Sharia law as a basis is a controversial issue.
The Egyptian President Saharan waters not with emotion.
We must create the transition.
'And that it is successful, is my responsibility, before the people and before God,' he said on state television.
His speech was the whole people, but above all to the Coptic Christians, the Liberals, enlightened Muslim and secular.
Because they all hopelessly divided, so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy the Nile by Grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said, have almost entschuldigend Mohamed Morsi, the competences of the Constitutional Court and its competences extended temporarily restricted 'in order to save the revolution'.
But what the 61-jährige engineer, of a doctorate the American University of Südkalifornien, really want to save, the Egyptians, is not quite clear in the world.
The judiciary is to be ousted?
Indeed, the Article 234 dominated by the Islamist 100-person Constituent Assembly because in a night, 15-stündigen Parforceritt have been rushed through some worrying.
As in previous constitutions also states in the draft law, the title of 'the principles of Islamic law'.
But what does' Principles'?
That was and is open to interpretation and it is feared that the Islamists the vague wording and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia law.
This suggests at least a newly hinzugeführter Article: the Sharia law in all these matters are the influences on this point, the main Islamic institution of the country with great power in the whole of the Sunni Islam.
This must not, but it may mean that the clergy overseeing the legislation, which de facto the disempowerment of the judiciary.
In many Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation
Also a problem: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These Courts while Mubarak ’ s rule, have served to the repression of political opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11 000 civilians in Militärhaft.
The state should also, as it says in the draft, 'the true nature of the Egyptian family' protect 'and their morality and promote its values'.
That is legally as vague wording that state institutions, with the help of this article even the content of cinema and literature could control.
In plain English, this means nothing other than censorship.
Incidentally, is no article expressly the equality of men and women.
This prohibits another, the Prophet Mohammed and its envoy to insult or to slander.
But what is an insult and how it is to be punished, remains unclear.
Just as questionable is the wording of the 'insulting people' is banned.
There is already a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of Leader?
Open to interpretation, as so much in the design, Morsi to sign and after his words' very soon, 'the Egyptians to the referendum will be presented.
'The revolution has returned'
The opposition is taking shape, for weeks, against the excessive power of the Islamists.
Tens of gathered in an agreement on on Friday evening, in Cairo ’ s Tahrir Square and promised, the Charter, even before it can enter into force.
'The revolution has returned and we will win, "said Hamdin Drittplatzierter Sabbahi, the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Ex-Chef the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said, the draft Constitution belong 'on the scrapheap of history'.
Via Kurznachrichtendienst Twitter he accused followers Morsi ’ s, a 'coup against democracy' lead to want.
'If it the referendum, we will be devoted to his palace and overthrow him, "said the opposition Jasser Said.
'We are still not to tire of the blood of our brothers is not yet been atoned', the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
A number of judges and announced that the referendum is not want to monitor, making it would be invalid.
'The Koran is our Constitution'
The well organized Muslim Brotherhood inflated Gegendemonstration in turn, the safe side, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a Massengebet on the other Nilufer before the Cairo university.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis attended and called: 'The people calls on the application of God's law.'
They called for by Morsi: 'Säubere the country,' and extremely: 'The Koran is our Constitution.'
A fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything would have started civil.
Morsi ’ s supporters were obviously not at risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated, both the opponents to endorse the draft EU Constitution and the supporters would have said loud and clear.
Now is the time, the people at the ballot box to decide the direction in which the country should go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is safe.
'The word' human rights is not even before '
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this upsurge of constitutional process, which actually have until February and to involve all social forces.
The 48-jährige human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when, under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share the belief, but because for him rights are indivisible.
For that he was arrested, beaten, condemned.
'And now is the word' human rights is not even in the new Constitution ', he criticises in conversation with the' world on Sunday '.
Morsi Machtausweitung to all three powers in the state of the lawyer give in.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and Egypt in a new dictatorship.
'Instead to strengthen civil society, they have the President' de facto override, complained Saeda.
But a democracy without civil society organisations could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which the ideological Richtungskampf the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could take revenge.
A protestor on the Tahrir warns: 'Your gebährt a monster that it can no longer control'.
Rakfisk from Norway: is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy the highest standard of living - and not only in Europe but around the world.
The key of the country could do with the local appetite for rather nasty smelling fish have to do?
We note a selection überreifer cheese.
We in the midst of a crowd platziere it against dirty, more humid.
And they leave that a week.
Approximately one must the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk imagine that one of the major delicacies Norway.
I am in the small town Fagernes, almost three hours of Oslo.
There is a spectacular, snow landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which simply is not to disappear.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, the - depending on how stinkend its fish would like - to a year in water ferments.
If in Norway the darkness of the country and the weather is colder will flock Norwegians, to a celebration here in Fagernes that this, now, really very bestechenden speciality is devoted.
'You it eats raw and carries it then, with a glass aquavit down', says Havard Halvarsen, in fact the local fire station is working, but as a so-called 'Rakfisk-General' the festival.
Around us to eat Fischwürfel people to take small and large quantities of alcohol.
'Mansche people may aquavit more than the Rakfisk,' says Havard.
The spirit can smell.
I have some pausing to cost.
If it avoids setting Rakfisk to bring in Nasennähe, it is not bad, such as sushi, the bus behind a very long.
Rakfisk is the product of a quite different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no first and fish in the autumn in luftdichten Salzwasserfässern has been watered.
In the deepest winter Fermentierung he was then, after a long and - no doubt, by means of alcohol tempered end - eaten.
Even before a generation saw thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and, mainly in the US.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a prosperous labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, not that long ago was much richer than Norway, skilled immigrants.
Rakfisk will be seen as something important - as an essential, if strict riechender part of the Norwegian history.
He belongs to the more expensive courts, which we can buy here.
But here is actually all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich proud costs EUR 10.
Norway is not often in the world press, and most people, that seems not to disturb.
Here we are still hates, Anders Breivik - to name those racist extreme right, the last year, 77, men, women and children.
Instead, we only refers to the 'incident of 22 July'.
Norwegian find it difficult to accept that someone in its peace-loving country to such brutal murders is capable of.
The main responsibility for today ’ s wealth of Norway is since the early 1970 ’ s growth of the largest oil and Gasindustrien the world.
'But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well, "says Anna, our waitresses, the round trays with reifem Rakfisk distributed and with its long fair-haired hair and the stechend blue eyes of the Nordic ideal.
We are a - as they say - prudent people.
Her English is just as the most people here impeccable.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not have ostentation.
Norway is dealt with its oil wealth very careful - a large part of the Branchenerträge will for the benefit of future generations in a special fund.
As in the years leading up to the Great Depression all the money raised, it does not had its purse, Norway firmly closed.
'As long as we in the winter of ski and in the summer, can go, we are happy,' says Anna.
'And Rakfisk eat', of course, she adds with unbeschwertem laughter.
I am in the snow and for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
So a Elch-Burger is certainly something different. The hefty meat enjoy me.
But in the evening is once again the Stinkefisch of the diet.
The hotel, where I logiere, is one of several Veranstaltungsorten to organise a Rakfisk-Dinner, in the guests for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish Geruchssinne vote in favour of.
There is a Live-TV-Schaltung to a with bird there were Showmaster, which is surrounded by tables with Rakfisk.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
'What is the sum total of you up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?'
'There are our points Havard'.
One where and laughs.
A man of his seat falls, perhaps, from the aquavit overwhelmed.
But it is perhaps the strict haze of the whole of the fish.
Mexico ’ s Enrique Pena Nieto is facing difficult start
While Mexico ’ s future President Enrique Pena Nieto on his term of office, prepared by the BBC Will Grant analysed the forthcoming challenges and mixed feelings of its people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even better days ago, this is always a clogged city, but on Monday was a ring of steel, several important routes in the capital absperrt and on the roads for chaos.
The aim was not, however, commuters on the way to work to disrupt demonstrators, but to prevent Parliament to achieve.
On Saturday, Mexico ’ s new President Enrique Pena Nieto the Präsidentenbinde and the leadership of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderon ’ s, Mexico, to prove economically well, but the country is in the grip of a Drogenkriegs, in the last six years has cost 60 000 lives.
'My Administration is strongly committed to the violence to reduce Nieto Pena', said at the beginning of this week in the Oval Office the US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.
Before he was on an equal footing with the US President, was Pena Nieto as Governor of his Heimatstaats Mexico.
In this densely populated, rambling part of the country's capital city surrounds the opinions are divided on the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote small town Valle del bravo remembered, for example, like to him.
Inhabitants of Urlaubsorts him write the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to achieve the city, you can drive one of the motorways, the Pena Nieto built and a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy streets, here again.
With his behalf, badges are also outside of a modern Sportzentrums and of an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
'We expect real and lasting changes', as his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, as Congressman for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, regarding the safety and economy is concerned, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera is that the Party after 12 years of outside the Palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He was a very direct man, very committed and have great plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, above all, but it is also someone who can listen to.
But on the other side of the state do not share this view, many people on their former Governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast to the paved roads of Valle del bravo not be greater.
The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the Community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year the military was involved in the neighbourhoods, in order to combat drug gangs operating, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In a corner of fallow land in the vicinity of a large landfill have been in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murders of women.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto in the state of Mexico have been more than 1,000 women murdered - a statistic which even the city of Ciudad Juarez, for their violence and murders of innocent women is notorious.
The critics Pena Nietos believe that it is the problem of feminicide, during his term of office, at least not adequately tackled.
But his government in the worst case, have their eyes closed.
In a Betonbau, typical of the run-down neighbourhoods, is fighting Irinea Buendia with tears, as I think they are photos of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows.
The official version of events, committed suicide Mariana 2010.
But their family believes that it was murdered by their partners.
'When I arrived in their home, it seemed as if their bodies have been washed', remembers Senora Buendia.
There were signs that they had been beaten, and the Leichenstarre had already begun.
While their mother told their history, has a picture of the wall of Mariana down to us. It is in addition to a cross appropriate that a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, as the family, we have until now.
The authorities have dealt with me, as if I were a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin, Nörglerin.
They want their judgment simply accepted and shut up.
'But that is not possible, if there were so many errors and omissions,' says it.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday, he receives the Präsidentenbinde is also a great responsibility.
Tens of Mexican families were in the last six years of violent crime, and the new President has promised during his term of office, particularly to attend to this problem.
'I hope, as President, it is as it was as Governor,' says the PRI-Kongressabgeordnete Olvera in Valle del bravo.
But that is exactly what is the fear of the families of victims in Ciudad Neza most.
The public prosecutor Bradley Manning have said: not complaining about mistreatment
The public prosecutor contradicts Bradley Mannings accusations that he was tortured in prison
The hearing deals with Mannings time in Militärgefängnis in Quantico, Virginia
The defence is seeking a rejection of the charge due to tough conditions of detention of
The Corporal the US army is accused of thousands of confidential documents to have stolen
On Friday the Public Prosecutor has tried to note that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning - for the largest revelation of confidential information of the US history - several occasions over the failed he allegedly suffered ill-treatment in Militärhaft to complain.
In a democratic cross-examination Mannings vorgerichtlichen during a hearing in FT. Meade, Maryland declared Maj. Ashden Fein that documents to weekly visits, the prison officers while Mannings neunmonatiger period of detention in Quantico, Virginia, no complaints about their treatment.
One day before the democratic cross-examination, the following a request of the defence to reject the charge was held - Manning by the severe prison sentence has already been punished enough - had Manning, he would have considered the suicide in prison.
The US Army Geheimdienstanalyst in June 2010 was arrested, accused of thousands in Iraq during his tenure confidential documents.
The material was then by WikiLeaks published on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday was Fein with Manning the forms, the officials to their meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico-Militärgefängnis, where he replied, by July 2010 until April 2011 under enhanced conditions of detention eingesessen.
The officials were Manning questions and wrote his answers to.
As Fein him on Friday to the forms, that he was Manning to the treatment by his guards as' excellent 'and the treatment by the institution as a whole as' very professional ".
The forms, so Fein, gave no complaints about mistreatment, although the officials Manning directly consulted had to its treatment.
Manning replied that he had his concerns expressed orally and the officials have discussed this with him and, to deal with them. They are not, however, been recorded.
You wrote '(after meeting the concerns)' No 'to problems, and this meant not necessarily mean that I absolutely nothing said, "Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lindh, Manning also asked why he is not on his treatment, as he complained in January 2011 with a committee, which met him a few months in advance on a form Suizidgedanken mentioned.
Manning replied, his intention during this meeting have consisted of his Beobachtungsstatus to 'prevention of injury' to begin by downgrading.
The military has said, there have him this restrictive status - of a stage in the Selbstmordgefährdung is - to his and the protection of other.
'I wanted to convince people that I went well, and on the prevention of injury Beobachtungsstatus (...) in order to get rid of a higher quality of life in my view, be able to achieve', said Manning.
Manning said on Thursday to his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he almost two months before he was held in July 2010 in the prison of the naval base Quantico in Virginia has been deferred.
He said, Kuwait, he had the suicide and is considered as a result of the heat even unconscious.
Not allowed to know what with him or in the outside world is, is untenable.
'My world shrank to Camp Arafjon cage, on this together, "said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I would die in the cage.
When he was moved Quantico Manning, have the majority of his days spent in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
We have only a mattress, a ceiling, Flip-Flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said that he had tried to remain in motion, because on the day, there have been prohibited to sleep or even ground.
He always have with light sleep, which must, in his cell starve.
If he turned at night and guards face no longer be able to see who have it, so that it is again being.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally protest against the treatment Mannings.
In April 2011 was Manning in the Militärgefängnis of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge interviewed Manning also to an accusation, which he made in his statement on Thursday - as he had had a night of naked in his cell in Quantico sleep and in a morning counting naked before Guards and other prisoners.
Manning had stated that he had during this count never had the opportunity to umhüllen with its ceiling.
At the hearing on Friday, Manning, he ordered his watch from a closed, that the ceiling, he would have been able to cover should fall. He was, however, that nobody had called for.
On Thursday Manning stated that he had in the previous night been forced to sleep naked. It could have been tried before a civil servants to show that it poses no danger to themselves.
The officials Manning have said that he would have the Confederation of his underwear or its Flip-Flops can use to injure themselves, not, however, done so.
That night, Manning from, whether his underwear, Flip-Flops and spectacles been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge his Hafterlebnisse at least take into account and will be drastically reduce Haftmaß, he should have at his trial before the military tribunal. This is for the beginning of next year.
The defence has indicated that Manning is less offences committed guilty, while other charges to be regarded as extremely should be challenged.
The continuation of the consultation is scheduled for this weekend. By the Public Prosecutor will be a justification of the detention conditions expected.
The Pentagon maintains its position that has been detained Manning in accordance with the provisions for all of the highest safety in Quantico verwahrten prisoners.
The charges against Manning include the promotion of the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence on the Internet, the transfer of national Verteidigungsinformationen and the theft of public property or documents.
It will in all charges found guilty, he is facing a life sentence.
My mexikanisch-amerikanische identity crisis.
Many people are given the lack of opportunities, Mexico forced to leave
Mexicans, the immigrants tend to blame - they call them in difficult times, he says
Navarrette is the view that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just the hall running and was reached in the passport, as a dilemma in me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for 'Mexicanos' ('Mexicans'), the other for 'Extranjeros' ('foreigners').
I was there a few seconds, uncertain, to which I should like to go.
I am in Zentralkalifornien has been raised and all my life 'Mexicans'.
An ethnic acronym - just as my friends in Boston 'Irish' or my friends in New York "Italians'.
Later, I opted for 'Mexikanisch-Amerikanisch'.
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather's there was no need for acronyms or hyphenation.
I was simply Americans.
I am speaking Spanish, at least well enough to me in this language at both ends of interviews to say.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American emphasis I will also not happening.
Therefore, I took my American passport and asked me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought this week on the moment when the future President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House, in order to meet President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues which we expect, if the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason that Mexicans today, with just as likely to remain in Mexico, rather than emigrating to the United States.
He would like to deal with the United States and Canada and a North American trading bloc for example of the European Union.
And he swore Pena Nieto Mexico, the war against the drug cartels to continue, even if he no details.
Mexico ’ s relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans have probably never waste a single idea that the United States in 1848 invaded in Mexico and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem rifle forced them to more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans in centuries, and not in Minutes think, are memories of this event not to overlook.
Therefore, once a US-Regierungsbeamter only mildest criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - of complaints, as the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children Montezumas is leaving for the war-path.
And yet is the biggest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
The inclination, resentment to speak?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for which the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio live, is that on a point in our family tree of a person - perhaps a parents' associations or Großelternteil - no chance in Mexico needed, and towards North immigrated.
And in most cases this person was a profile - brown-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the offspring of these people, and our allegiance to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we now live perhaps the American dream, good schools have visited and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that the American dream is that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is perhaps sometimes blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many Members of the Mexican ruling class may not.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a monument a humiliating defeat and look to us, because we are not mexikanisch enough.
Our Spanish will never good enough, our relations with Mexico never be strong enough.
Their opinion, is a symbol of the failure of our existence.
If not our families in Mexico, they would not have failed.
And then we would not now caught behind the Seidenvorhang see - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child einwanderte legally in the United States, I am reminded that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take it for them.
While it is American citizen, it feels as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, who I know have the feeling that neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican bond Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen song come.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we will be seen as the Americans.
And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that this relationship is more complicated: some of the Mexican leaders and parts of the Bildungsbürgertums wish to resume their links to the diaspora.
They want to Mexican Americans as a provisional 'ambassador' for Mexico, their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues of them as to how great a visit this country is, and pressure on the political leadership, to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many wounded feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of incomes, the rampant corruption and the Drogengewalt many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I fear that, alone with their cronies.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans not yet ready, the United States for dealing with Mexico and a half centuries, they must also accept that some of the Mexican Americans have a resentment for their family members, as only not so long ago have been treated.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are 'Mexican', as I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be unexpected cornerstone for the peace
Is it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual blame countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and killed six Israelis - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of the Israeli city in Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while the Israelis and Palestinians trapped in their historic conflict seems, is changing the Middle East around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the lethal stalemate could at last find its end.
A war that is not yet lost
At first glance, optimism, given the current situation anything other than appropriate.
Even if the on 21 November agreed cease-fire lasts, the week's fighting the tough-minded on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement, which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis to have reduced, even though his group has even large losses.
Although some of the leaders and killed 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the desolatesten and densely packed bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel until now, have not managed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, the Hamas in the West Bank, which of the rival, moderate Palästinensergruppe Fatah is controlled.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that the time they have on their side.
So, as Islamists in the Arab world to have influence, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends can draw on their side.
Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power, the once as Israel ’ s closest Muslim ally has taken for Hamas Party - like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Cheerful Hamas-Anhänger believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power on Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren stamp before the Stürzung Bashar ’ s, to Jordan, where Hamas-Verbündete the King.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - far and away the einwohnerstärksten and most important Arab country - from the southern flank of Israel has greatly altered the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular tyrant, Egypt, until his fall 2011 30 years, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas verschwägert and their leaders more dependent on Volksansichten.
In future diplomatic negotiations could prove to be the Hamas as a player, even by Israel and the United States are not excluded.
Israeli hardliners, however, let the opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no risk more.
The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome ', has to prove and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will can sleep more easily.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remain steadfast in its position. Many European countries have the Hamas Gewalteskalationen made responsible for the latest.
Israel is there in recent years is good, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, of the peace process has largely ignored.
Although rockets from Gaza since 2004, around 30 Israelis have killed, is the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the security wall has, in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state. This protect hineinverlaufen the Jewish settlements, which is to have been declared illegal under international law, but always be developed further.
Netanyahu is good because. His Likud Party has in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, with a more hawkish Avigdor Lieberman, allied kämpferischeren group.
Why these hinterlistigen Palestinians and a nanny state of their own devices?
If they actually the control of the West Bank, they would then have not just as their allies in Gaza also firing of rockets?
No, it is better to have them behind the wall at bay and punish, they should dare to the heads.
Perhaps it will be able to enforce the hardliners. But the Arab Spring could offer them a case of.
Even if the Islamists, who now in Egypt and in other countries are little for Israel, they will begin with the difficulties in their own country.
The taken by Israel is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower the new Arab governments will hardly help in the restoration of their economy.
The pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama to oust to achieve a ceasefire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Even Israelis should long-term thinking.
While the rest of the Arab world tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which is undoubtedly one day in the Israeli occupied territories will explode, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv to explode.
The repression undermines already the democracy of the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
Bloody missions for the eradication of the Hamas in Gaza over the years of increasingly its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a boost from outside
The right answer is that which the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and of this newspaper: two states, in which Israel's security areas.
The small - for the near future - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders more influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar stop the flow of arms in the Gaza Strip and is better placed than ever before, the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and a common Jerusalem.
Outsiders Arab nations should also the Hamas and Fatah move to an agreement.
That would be more to the creation of a Palestinian state than done with the forthcoming request for UN-Beobachterstatus.
Obama must also play its part, Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he failed to the presentation of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he is as a participation reluctant.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States have a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And this includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws in force for uniform Zigarettenverpackungen
Body parts and ill health warnings on packets, neutral Green Tabakmarken are equal for all the
The world's first laws for single cigarette and Tabakverpackungen in Australia are in force. This will and paints Markenlogos olivgrüne lid replaced by neutral, which is, moreover, with dramatic images opt, which are sick body parts and by tobacco smoke sick infants and children.
Of the different health warnings and pictures, apart from next Saturday is the only difference between packets in the trade in small letters are identical, printed.
Therefore, lead the world's most stringent rules for Australia Tabakverpackungen.
The Australian Government wants to young people smoking, by the glamorous picture of tobacco consumption is removed.
This is the government of studies, which have shown that people who, with 26 have not started to smoke, with 99% disabled probability, then no longer will start.
'You can already see in children, young age, that they understand the message that the tobacco companies with their Markenbild try to apply', as Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies have shown that children, for example, the crown of a logo with the idea of Princess associate.
Although Australia one of the slightest Raucherquoten of the world and the changes are only slightly on the profits of multinationals will have to consider other countries have already similar steps.
The tobacco lobby hard fought against the laws.
It was said, with the laws of black-market trade, which would benefit to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes.
'The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,' says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia recorded.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters to be far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others say that the laws have to boost their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses, notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and Silikondeckeln to cover the intolerable packaging, has grown enormously since the corporations British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago on top of the Australian Court, with its challenge to the laws failed.
Zico have up to 6 000 units to Großhandelsgeschäfte sold and await new stocks.
For us this is a good deal.
According to the experts, is the hole in the popularity of social media in exactly the population, to which the plan.
A number of Australian legislation, has banned from the tobacco companies TV-Werbung, it prohibits them as Sportsponsoren and the majority of businesses forced to cigarettes in shops. Now no longer to interpret the tobacco advertising on the Internet is changed.
The Australian Government has online advertising banned by local companies and sides, however, has no influence on international sides.
'Who tobacco and marketed only a small area has left its products, in order to apply to the Internet is not', says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the health of the University of Sydney.
Social media as YouTube and Facebook, Twitter has Freeman an increase in Erfahrungsberichten to brands, which 'ordinary people'.
We must ask the question: is this just a private individual, the great favours Marlboro-Zigaretten will take place, that they even include a video - or has a Marketing-Agentur to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia recorded says that the industry instead of focusing on marketing point, with the new laws.
It has even gone so far, the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay the new rules - those countries to complain in the World Trade Organisation on unfair Handelseinschränkungen, although none of the countries greater trade with Australia.
For a WTO ruling is expected in 2013.
According to the government has Plibersek talks with other countries that consider similar Verpackungsgesetze.
Canada was in 2001 the first country to the treatments warnings required.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are stubbornly.
I do not affect the images.
I simply ignoring them.
'It is simply a bad way and is the box away,' says Victor El Hage when buying a packet, on a photograph with a Mundtumor is printed.
Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my small girls.
James Yu, operators to serve the interests of major tobacco-trading 'King of the Pack' in the inner city of Sydney, says that the uniform packaging have the stacking shelves it more difficult.
'sooner, I have an hour needed to ensure a supply einzusortieren, now I need four', says Yu.
'The government would simply completely prohibit cigarettes - then we would have told us that it was' s, we close ', he adds significantly upset.
In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is good, also to be bored
I spent this Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours in the airport, as our aircraft operated by mechanical problems and we have had to wait another aviators.
I therefore had enough time to me a few thoughts on boredom.
I do not lie.
Half a day at the airport on a flight to wait, is quite nervtötend - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, steuerfreies shopping) are available.
But still more academics and boredom Kindesentwicklungsexperten lead as something positive.
If they are concerned, it is for us - and our children - well, sometimes to be bored.
This is the brain, be forced to lose in interesting line of reasoning, which may the creativity.
And because the majority of us today, almost constantly on the one or other screen rigid, are the benefits of boredom not more.
The boredom we should therefore welcome with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back again.
How many people also, I am always assumed that boredom a relatively recent phenomenon that is with growing leisure has developed.
But, Mr Peter Toohey, Professor for Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of 'Boredom: a Lively History' (Yale University Press 2011), it is not so.
'In fact the boredom a very long history', he says.
The Hauswände Pompejis ziert a Latin graffiti on boredom, on the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood associated, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that, defined and boredom in many ways been discussed.
After long reading Forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea of a Fokusgruppe of almost 100 people were Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to the conclusion that boredom as the experience, 'a satisfactory activity, but that does not want to be able to define'.
Boredom differs from apathy, therefore, that the person concerned is not, however, this would like to be.
At the apathy, on the other hand, there is no desire to do something.
The Schlüsselerfahrung the boredom, he says, in a "disturbance of Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time only slowly passes'.
Thus boredom can almost as to listen to such as depression.
However, Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions are bored people could see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that we have is dull, even if we merely difficulties, we have to focus.
In its study 'The Unengaged mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention - German, for example:' The inert minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention ', which in September in the journal' Perspectives on psychological Science 'appeared, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment with the participants a bond listen to which a person a Magazinartikel read.
Some groups have heard a resounding channel from the neighbouring area, which nothing to do with the content. Others had heard it at the lower volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group these noises not heard.
Those who gave barely recognisable television echoes of boredom, more than the other two groups - to feel they have had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If an attempt at a difficult or arduous task, the disruption to focus attention on boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated Professor for neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, if you a dreary work - 'as the search for defective products on a Fabrikförderband can distract, music and help, not to feel bored'.
Indeed, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even combat by people can remain physically more attentively.
'studies have shown that children who herumhampeln, must learn more and more information than those who keep stillsitzen be forced to', as Professor Fenske.
All of us will eventually boring - my delayed flight, a dröhnender, loudspeakers particularly ermüdender film.
But some people bore more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, advanced researchers in the 1980 ’ s a 'scale to Langeweileanfälligkeit'.
On the scale are statements such as' For many things that I have to do and are repeating monotonously 'and' I have many interests, that I do not have enough time for all '.
Through these scales, researchers found that more girls than boys boring, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - in particular, what the need for more and a greater diversity of external stimuli.
But in general are teenagers a fairly abgespannter bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor for human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment, in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager kontaktierte.
He found that 32% of adolescents in the school and to do the homework were bored, whereas 23% said that to be bored, if they were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents gave, bored.
Professor Larson say today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom increase or decrease.
He was sure, however, that 'the young people is seen as particularly boring, mainly because children and teenagers no great influence on their Alltagsablauf.
Back then to my Ursprungsfrage: is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it brings people extreme physical risks and the gambling or drugs, in order to alleviate them - the studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors of the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, the issue for more than two decades.
'With the boredom wants the brain a say that we should do something else, Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain do not know what it is always the best should do.
If a boring and these energy is used to play and Gitarre to cook, will be happy.
But in the short term for Glücksgefühle television can ensure that these fizzle but again in the long term.
His bored child who is therefore an iPad, can be diverted from boredom. It has not learned however, in order to maintain or to control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: 'self-regulation is transferred from a situation on the other'.
The baby learns not only to maintain, but is also in other areas more self-regulation.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
We should also see it not be too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to us and outside of the permanent Aktivitäts- Technologieberieselung at ease.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
'It is so often, as we should be boring. But boredom, the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful', he says.
He believes that the people in reality only after a way forward, and less so.
'In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to deal with it, even if the noise is dead.'
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new Marihuanagesetz
The 19-jährige Community College-Student and footballers Anthony Orozco is in the south-east Colorados for a crime to justice in this state, which soon will be legally: the possession of some less Marihuanabrocken and a tune with which he these rauchte.
Orozco, he and some friends in a Septembertag with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas, as they were stopped.
After the police officers marijuana, was found in the car Orozco for the possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien appear - Kavaliersdelikte, each with a fine of $100 is - and has received a court hearing.
'We are being treated like criminals', so Orozco.
But it is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small quantities of marijuana to legalise the case, the answer depends in hundreds of smaller takes less by law, as the site.
Hundreds of minor in marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the similar measures approved, has already dropped.
The police authorities pursue 21 years no longer for property in a small scale. This is legally permitted, once the new laws in the next few weeks to come into force.
But public prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados have announced, existing Marihuanadelikte people are still pursuing and quote in court.
At the same time, several cities vote in favour of the suburbs Denvers up to the Western Mountains, and new, state licensed Marihuanageschäfte to the opening in their communities.
'This situation is developing so rapidly that I do not know what will happen next,' says Mr J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, the East of Denver.
Regulators and also in the state of Washington scratch are perplexed at the head.
They are waiting for a guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of drugs - and we have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington is one of the view that Colorado in any case, the majority of States is what the regulation of marijuana. There was the drug only for medical purposes, and then Eigenkonsum legalised.
'Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore good for the orientation', says Mr E. Smith, the spokesperson of the Supervisory Authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also that there is no place or system can do more, as in terms of gross guide to serve.
'We have no real precedent, which we can follow', he adds.
The Washington law called I-502, on 6 December in force and is thus also the conclusion of a grey area in which the State licensing system is not yet exist, but the possession has legalised.
And unpleasant Praxisfragen must be clarified - in this time around, as the state imposition of a 'fair access' lizenziertem marijuana with the ban on Cannabisgeschäften around 300 metres in schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed.
'nowhere more difficult, it will be a location for to find a lizenziertes Cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, particularly in Seattle Ballungsgebiet', says Ben Livingston, the spokesperson for the 'Center for Legal cannabis', a group of scholars recently formed.
On 21 November, Chief Oates his staff in Aurora an e-mail he said that the public prosecutor would smaller Marihuanadelikte in people no longer follow on 21 years, and that the police 'immediately' not identified for these crimes will strive for.
Chief Oates added that the police to urban guidelines for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana will prevail and drug traffickers continue to be pursued.
In the north County Weld Colorados represents Bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken buck a stricter view.
After the vote, he gave to his authority would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz, mainly in order to persuade consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently must 119 people for the possession of around 50 grams or less marijuana trial, although many also for other offences have been charged.
'Our authority has the duty to pursue infringements, where the crime was' Tatzeitpunkt buck, in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marihuana-Initiative ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of Landkreises shows adults, for the possession of small quantities no longer.
Bezirksstaatsanwalt Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided to add, however, not all outstanding Besitzverfahren fall.
'I do not believe that I think that wastes time, to enforce the law, to change', he says.
While 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure was already clear from the start that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions in the whole state encouraged by local officials a fundamental dilemma with regard to the big green experiment.
In Bezirksstaatsanwälten if it is a 'cultural barrier,' says Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver, the Court for Marihuanadelikte the defendants, and on the ground as spokesperson for the national organisation on the reform of Marihuanagesetzen operates.
'You have such a large part of their life, spent to prosecute people for the legalisation that they still cannot accept', does he think.
The first States, the smaller quantities of marijuana treat such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington as a national test-cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocate and civil servants to prepare an age of legal sales at the same time, they are waiting anxiously on orders of the Federal Government, which the sale and the cultivation of marijuana at the federal level to continue to treat as a crime.
Advocates of Legalisierungsbewegung hope that the Justice Ministry is going to give in.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers medical Marihuanas the Federal Government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to the majority.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Drogenpolitik-Berater the Obama administration is the view that law are probably no doors, in order to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but presumably resist that, under the new legislation legal, publicly regulated Marihuana-Geschäfte to tolerate.
Many towns in Colorado not wait for the fact that the federal authorities act.
Before the election day approved some local municipalities moratoria on new Marihuana-Geschäfte, although this only in a year could open up.
Montrose decided last week, a city in the West, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week.
'We do not want in a position where we license someone at the federal level and then have a huge problem', as Bob Nicholson, a Member of the Council.
Our Community has voted against this amendment.
We then, for what the Community has decided and not afterwards, for what the state has decided.
There are still many questions unanswered.
Wyatt Petronella: I was from Oxford, because I am being bullied Tory
Not only university students today will be attacked for their views
It was always been my greatest dream, a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had those university, I once for the largest Wissenstempel the world, for a modern Greek symposium that the great pillars of civilisation - free thinking and tolerance -.
Yet, within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College the end of the 1980s - there I had intended to study, history - I had my suitcase again tackled and so the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it said, I would be, because I had a problem that colleagues in the neighbouring room sex.
The author A N Wilson said schelmisch, I would leave the university, because I was forced to drink from crockery damaged.
But the truth was less amusing.
I walked away.
Yes, expired, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I come from a private school offers.
I was only for one reason being harassed - a reason, in this supposed cradle of enlightenment in order to narrow and cruel seemed: my now late father Woodrow Wyatt was an important advisers of Margaret Thatcher, and I advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to recent reports is suffering a new generation of students of the moderate rights under similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred on Tory-Studenten in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them the same Gleichberechtigungsschutz last week, the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative Members of the younger common rooms (JCR) of the corpus of Christ College, they are due to their political views' often active in isolation, attacked personally and for undesirable declared '.
They call for a place in Gleichberechtigungskomitee their College, in order to ensure that their opinions freely can be expressed.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent screened documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right ', the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It has been demonstrated, among other things, a graduate Joe Cooke, former President of the conservative student Association of Oxford University, in a Rolls-Royce and with silberfarbenem suit and silberbesetztem Gehstock protzte.
In other universities say conservative students, they will be as' scapegoats for the introduction of higher fees'.
The 20-year Luke black, Vice-President of the conservative Studentenvereinigung the University of Nottingham, in a Sunday newspaper: 'There is a growing Linkstendenz in universities.
The people believe that we are as the Bullingdon club, without us to come at all '.
Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in corpus of Christ, the request for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is' inconvenient '. The 19-jährige Stephanie Cherill, designated President of the conservative student unification of Oxford says that they have in JCR-Mitgliedern a growing opposition to students of the moderate rights observed.
'This is a threat to the intellectual debate and for the well-being of Members', it says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was one such a minority.
As an unbelievably timid 18-Jährige I was in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year had voted in favour of the university, Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of cuts in higher education no title of honour.
The atmosphere would have even Stalinists squirm.
In the first days of the Erstsemester-Woche, in the new students and Tutoren know, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the Tutoren the mockery of Tory-Studenten not only duldeten, but even attended it is with pleasure.
Political issues such as the Bergarbeiterstreik, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa have found their way into the areas of the Tutoriums holzgetäfelten.
In my first of these events, I should French texts from the eighteenth century translated into English. On what should come, I was not have been taken.
Wyatt 'Miss', said the tutor Harry Pitt (now died), 'please translate the first paragraph'.
I, in this.
Pitt was a small man with a face as from Kuchenteig, and quite invidious.
"refuse Thatcher-Anhänger to learn, French, or are they simply stupid? 'he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
In my eyes wallten tears.
'I propose that in your leisure a few Französischstunden - so, if you not to your social activities are employed' knurrte me Pitt.
I returned with hängendem capita in my room.
This evening, I sat in the College alone having dinner, as somebody easy on the shoulder tippte.
It was a Englischstudent from the second year called James, as a Member of the conservative student Association presented.
'I know who you are', he said enough.
Unfortunately, it is, as it is.
Anyone who is suspected of Tory, is to be harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher close, it will therefore be worse for you.
The most Tory-Erstsemester give, supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub later, I tried to me.
I have insisted, in all the points that I do not agree with Mrs Thatcher was.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
In conclusion, a philosophy, politics and economy which, ironically, the conservative current Eton College, said to me: "You are the daughter of a Faschistenschweins'.
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and bad way.
'How have Tories sex? "asked me a.
Each other, or the propose?
I felt as homosexuals before the more liberal legislation of the United States have felt.
I would ever be able, at Oxford University to lead a normal life?
I would only after the collapse of the darkness Gleichgesinnte can take?
I should like to turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclination to suppress?
The three years, which were before me, gradually, before my intellectual eye to purgatory of the ban and isolation.
The only tutor, which is openly as a Tory, there was Norman Stone, Professor of contemporary history, its seat in my college.
He was not only to hate them, a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in terms of foreign policy and for their speeches had written.
He was only rarely since.
He detested the place, it was provincial and narrow and turned him for his marxistisch-deterministische Geschichtsperspektive.
1997 was a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
'You will not be happy,' he said to me.
I began, between Oxford and the House my parents to travel, and found refuge in more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father, I told that I hated Oxford, and why I did.
He seemed in disbelief.
During his time in the Vierzigern all political views were accepted.
'But it is the best place in the world', said he sheepishly.
So something they would never do not, in my city of träumenden Turmspitzen.
Even my communist friends, always good manners to the day.
Marred its wet eyes.
Give the whole a chance.
I am sure that you only neckt.
I would break the heart, if you gingst.
Exhausted by my frequent visits to London, my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also had Tory-Anhänger, the pressures and to renounce his convictions.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, where another Geschichtstutor seriously claimed, I was "an enemy of the people ', I decided to do the same.
Although I had secretly in shame zerging, I am a 'my parents had to undergo brainwashing', and called it 'old' stupid.
Facilitating lasted only briefly.
It was my father, of the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford-Karriere proposed.
At that time, he wrote per week two columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hidden me in my room after five minutes, and gave my Häscher.
As they went, grabbed I a suitcase and adopted the first move to London.
I never returned back.
Can you like to call me a weinerlichen Schlappschwanz.
But no 18-Jährige should ever in a school in spite of such intimidation and have to suffer.
And even more tragic is that it was - an Oxford University, which not only 14 Tory produced, but so far behind a windfall reputation of equality and freedom of thought in hiding.
'Valentino, elegance of celebrity'
At the exhibition 'Valentino - master of Couture', this week in London has been opened, speaks ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Modemachers.
Somerset House, the former residence by Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, the accommodating an exhibition on Valentino Garavani dignity.
This has the designer Valentino at the opening of '- a master of Couture' recognition of the grandiose retrospective, for the more than 130 clothes the Haute Couture have been compiled by his' Maison 'in the last 50 years have been created.
"I love this palace ', he says, with its distinctive Italian emphasis.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a history, whose only protagonist 'Il signore' Garavani, but without its distinguierte clientele would have to be written.
Valentino ’ s always fascination for the world of the nobility stickige and distant.
In the first Chamber this exhibition, until 3 March to see, there is a large number of private letters and photographs with the signature of the aristocracy erlesensten, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, on the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows this personal memories as trophies its social rise by the modest Modemacher in the city in northern Italy Voghera the idol of the international Jetsets.
In the nobility to be in love, must not be at a disadvantage.
'At least their be circumvented, they are not on your wonderful carpet, as some fine celebrities from the pop music do', says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s attended the two in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, more generous and elegant hosts.
'We all of us, if we were in his home in Gstaad were invited to the ", declared the Exfrau of' Heini 'Thyssen, chummy with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always been the elegance of celebrity preferred.
And yet it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza forgets the charisma of Modemachers not.
Many years ago we went into a Modeschau on Piazza di Spagna to him in Rome on the dinner home.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his home, the mere decoration, on food and in the music and its influence felt.
"All guests felt important and loved ',' that the 'Top-Modell their careers in the week of Haute Couture began in 1995 in Paris.
'He is never out of fashion, because its design works of art are' it says in conclusion.
Show of the origin
The lives of Garavani is not a history of Versessenheit, rather of reciprocal love affairs.
He may be people with good education and the highest qualifications, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was a glorious and 60 metres long bridge, which proposes a Rollentausch: the user adopted the place of the model and is the bridge, a fantastic 'audience' to admire masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress, Jackie Kennedy for their wedding with Aristóteles Onassis chose, the Kostüme, Monica Vitti in 'La Notte' or a cloak for wool and leather the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience from Modepuppen emit behalf of the Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of mail-coaches and taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal Modemacher, 2006 and the
Many of these have to say, the first Valentino is as the first love, 'unforgettable'.
I can remind me yet perfect.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a record type 'Gillette' and a jacket from the autumn / Winter-Kollektion 1971-1972.
'It was a gift of him,' says Naty Abascal, one of the Inter arma silent Musae of Designers.
'I prefer it to all others for its great love for the women and because it highlights our beauty,', the Ex-Herzogin and Feira.
I like the paints, which he uses, very; they have a great deal of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the Princess and Meinungsführende in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d Arenberg can the first time, as they do not forget a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, finally, I dreamed of the age and to have the opportunity, one of its Abendkleider …
At the end of the 1990s it was then, finally, on this.
I bought my first Valentino-Kleid for a festival in the castle of my Vetters, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a drapierten imports, with a have the honour his behalf.
'It was a true attributed dream,' says the widow of Rodrigo d Arenberg.
'Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless', explained this Italian Aristokratin between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D 'Arenberg preserved their Abendkleider of Modemachers' with the utmost care ',' because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories'.
The 'King' of fashion
The great finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the Hochzeitskleid of Marie-Chantal Miller for their wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 'Ragazze' (as the Modemacher his Näherinnen called) were necessary in order to this elfenbeinfarbene silk gown pearl-encrusted, twelve different embroidery; and a four and a half metres long Schweif.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, was this dress a milestone in the Haute Couture the end of the 20th century, the 'return to have the highest society'.
For years with the 'savoir-être' of the elite is Valentino now tempered their best copy.

'It is always be clever way, its calm, link and perfect appearance be noted, is' D 'Arenberg.
I have the last time a month ago in a Gala-Abendessen in the museum de'Orsay.
He was at the table of the'am Mrs Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
'He was impeccable; the time to leave no trace of it'.
And this says a Princess...
The most difficult profession of the world: the human Arbeitstiere of Kawah Ijen
For four euro, the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk, if they are 70 kilos of sulphur on the steep, stony ways.
There are people, for their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 Minenarbeiter who earn their lives by sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must down to every day on the ground of his Kraters rise, where the gas from the earth ausströmende schwefelhaltige been in contact with the air.
Having great Schwefelsteine has undermined, as a whole can weigh up to 70 kilos, transported it in two Bambuskörben on his shoulders on the slope paths of stone.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, to a level of 2386 metres, but the exhausted agencies need more than 40 minutes for the rise in Schildkrötentempo, using the balance and keep their steps must be careful, so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step of their lives, as a French tourist happened in the years ago, the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen plummeted.
The Minenarbeiter of Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulphur, which reduce them.
The top, they pave the way between the tourists, as Zirkusaffen photographs and run with the tiring serious baskets three kilometres to the balance, a Minengesellschaft a little further down a EUR 1 850 metres has established

The selling them then for per 10 000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral in everyday life is widespread and for the manufacture of matches next to, fireworks, cosmetics, Dynamit and even the bleaching of sugar will be used.
'Because we normally, we receive 70 kg for any way around 46 000 rupees (3.8 euro)', which normally Anto us three routes on the day.
For every line he needs three hours that he is completely managed, at the end of the day, but then he has 138,000 breast cancers detected rupees (11.5 euro).
What a lousy pay for such a downright inhuman effort, but it is three times as much as he would deserve the fields.

There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euro) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family after Banyuwangi, a village near, returned, and this for a reason that in Indonesia as important as the sulphur is: 'I have a girl from Bali, where they are married Hindus, and I have brought them after Java, in order to convert to Islam'.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, a coughing fit often and its eyes are due to the toxic gases prickly.

Singapore babies to save the economy needs
The Singapurer shift the blame that they do not have children, on the career, the stress and the costs of the real estate and childrearing.
'The people of Singapore must grow'.
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our civil responsibility and we create life!
It seems incredible that the Verses part of an advertising for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were initially in Singapore this year to a viralen YouTube video.
The sentences are part of a Rapper-Songs, the local slogans such as' pushing will be a 'Bao' (loaf) in the foot, about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which has undergone the video, preserves the hope that the advert on entertaining way, to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative head Alexander Hamilton says that he use the power of the music to the people to their 'national duty'.
This is something only for the Internet, we therefore had to make it amusing and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The breed we are the worst of the world, that is why we have said that it is an issue that we have had to look after.
We knew that the government much tried, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organisation of Speed-Dating-Abenden (rapid flirting).
Possible that many of these ideas creatively they were, but not necessarily led to success.
Therefore, we thought: why do we not something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a Rap to komponieren?
1.2 children
Anyone who takes this issue is not easy, the government of Singapore.
Every year there are 1 300 dollars for political measures to encourage the citizens, more to have children.
A package of the government granted for married couples and parents up to $15 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, hochtechnologischer city-state in South-East Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is known.
In accordance with its national Bevölkerungsbehörde the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate of 2 - what is known as Ersetzungsrate - was in 1976.
So why not get the Singapurer more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Executive Director for marriage and family policy of the national Bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this in a 'better training' and 'greater career'.
'This is the people, except to marry and to form a family much more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities', has declared it.
These changes in the social realities, have higher number of a single person and the delay of marriage and births, the result that the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy, which led to a sharp rise in the uphold those aims of the reduction of the population, resentment in the local population.
In Singapore, there are sites, where the little covert xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, particularly against the Chinese, the criticism that they maintain low wages and not integrate.
The increase in the immigration will also be seen as one of the reasons that the governing party in Singapore last year, its worst possible election since independence.
Since the elections was an attempt to the problem with higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers to be corrected.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the well-known impact on the growth of one nation, the tax revenues, the health costs and the immigration policy has, shows the example of Singapore also unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small homes are built.
It has already, also impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has started, the number of small Appartements to control, which are known as' Schuhschachteln and in certain areas of the city must be built.
These Appartements have a Wohnfläche of 46 square metres and show a large Verkaufserfolg.
However, there is concern that they are the lifestyle of the single, and that they can promote the construction firms from large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of Immobilienfirma EL Developers, says that his' Schuhschachteln 'much faster than larger units sell.
They are so popular, and the entities are days and weeks to be sold out even more quickly than the larger units.
This means that it is for our far has very much better.
It is, however, that the new standards the developers clearer guidelines, which previously obstacles placed in the way, if they were too many small units within a project to build.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules the way to an increase in the national birth rate might cause, is the talks with the Singapurern in the City of work, that they will not have a major impact.
'The people are strongly stressed, the housing and education is expensive, which is why it is deferred by many' says a young managers.
The children can get others.
'For me, it is important, on my own money and time to have' says another twenty years old man.
Men and women of their career, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as the reasons that they can have no children.
That is why the Singapurer the last word when it comes to have children - as the government can still do so much.
The online offline private offline is privately
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the capacity private or 'the area of private life, where we are entitled to protection against any kind of interference'.
What is privately for someone under 16 years ago?
How will this definition to his daily lives and the social networks to be implemented?
He understands the dangers to which he has put on the Internet situations when he makes known that he would not share in real life?
EL Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years, which often are on the Net.
In four of the cases of the concept of associated with 'something very own' on a personal level and 'to a password and the users', if it for the social networks.
'My deepest secrets, I would not be known in a post' says the 10 years old, Jorge the importance of "private" in websites as Hotmail and Facebook, Twitter, Windows Live messenger to explain where it accounts for two years.
'The are very confidential secrets, my mother must they know, but not the whole world', he confirmed.
On Francs I would invite beautiful images or images of games high.
I am also vertreibe my time with acquaintances.
'I would not share the photograph, not by me, or from someone who makes the stupid' he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong, obscene, photographs of naked, to publish of crime, or insulting or violent comments to write.
Jorge assured, 35 friends to know that he has and nine Folger Francs in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother, including the password to one of the accounts.
I reported on Twitter to me to express myself and interesting tweets to write.
'I do not know whether someone replies, I invite you, he adds only high'.
'The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly with relatives in the distance or with friends' are talking about it.
Asked he says that he never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone a stranger empfähle him, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
Has the teenager Benutzerkonten in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask it is, 20 of the people not to know that he has annexed Freundesliste.
'The frightens me is not because we have something in common, for example, music, "he is.
After indication of the boys insinuations or no one has made him for his address or telephone number.
'When someone me harassed or they demanded of me, I simply entferne him of my his account', it gives.
José appeared in Ask, Twitter after he had read in a recommendation.
The young are not unknown to the experience we know today as Cyberbullying.
The acquaintances a friend, a social network to ransom.
They threatened him and demanded money.
'He has never know who it was', he assured.
According to José his account the victims of this has not closed.
'He, it has only made private'.
Then he explained a number of steps to a safe konfigurieren his account.
Unlike Jorge would this boy photographs of acquaintances in inconvenient or embarrassing situations hochladen.
Yes, I would do if he is unsympathetic or one thing I want to be judging him.
"But I know that this is' Cyberbullying he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher for English with higher education in education and learning, believes that the children and young people, must be understood that the purpose of the social networks, information.
'The Internet arose as a medium for the search for information; with the appearance of these sides of the game have changed, but it says'.
Porras explained that the academics, Marc Prensky, holders of Master-Titels in teaching at the Yale University and author of the plant 'Digital Natives and Immigrants' these concepts on the statement by the phenomenon shaped.
The Digital Natives they are, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
'We are the digital immigrants to teach them, but even where we learn' he says.
He stated that it is a complex issue, 'because we demand that they have a defined criterion, which is widespread, published or should be mentioned, and this in an age where the maturity of this is not enough.'
'you should also turn our noses up to them, if it is most important, to be popular, thousands of friends, without reflect on the consequences', he adds.
According to the expert is the most effective way, the children and young people to teach them privacy, which is to ask questions that they thought.
'you to say that they should do not do it, does not work', he says.
Porras, then some possibilities: there are things that you not tell a stranger würdest. Why rabbits you then on the Internet?
Or is: would you like, if you are a photograph of you, as published by a friend, that you have published?
You what you publish on the other?
The other people you have asked for permission before, if you photos of celebration labelled?
And a further question: must all know what you do in any moment?
Another point is, to give them to understand that they must act online, as they do offline.
There are the same rules.
'They outside the Internet is with respect, decency and other principles, and the same must apply for the social networks', he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a professor, and educational advisers, comments that it is essential that the parents of the directives of the social networks carefully.
If they all sections understand, they have solid foundations, with their children on the importance of Eröffnens one Benutzerkontos on the Internet to talk.
'Beispielsweise the age, or what we must share or publish' he says.
According to the Guardia must the children of the lesson of 'thou shalt not talk to strangers' be reminded of it.

'South America in the integration of the citizens must learn', says, Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, with 'South America really can learn something from Europe.'
Correa, on 6 summit of the President of the Unasur (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru, that the Europeans' in the Second World War and in other conflicts were 'and' today is practically a country '.
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the Member States of the Unasur.
'must be achieved, the free movement of citizens and workers in all the South American countries, as mentioned in the Andean Community is the case; there are still, however, reactionary sectors, which seek a return to the past', he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the reform of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the proviso, the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and those to which the agreement of San José on human rights have signed.
Those who commit themselves to teach never something in return, and we are signing the South Americans always all.
'It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its seat in Washington and by the United States', he declared as a reference to political asylum, Ecuador, by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, has granted.
Correa were told that he not regret this decision, because it does not have betrayed its principles, but his' deep democratic values and views on human rights' is fulfilled.
He added that it was' well-founded suspicions that Assange have given to a third country cannot be extradited and procedures will be respected '.
He criticised the Swedish Justice, which also requires him him on its territory a interrogation because of alleged Sexualdelikts, while 'the Swedish case law this through a video conference, on the message of Ecuador in London should be carried out'.
Correa said that the danger that the health and the psychological state of Assange would be compromised.
'Ever since he is in our message is not with him, I have spoken, however, the Ambassador has informed me that he is a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious, "said the head of state Ecuador.
There is a danger, though, that he physical and psychological damage, because he was caught in a narrow area and no physical exercises outdoors can carry out.
'The would affect the health of every people, "he added.
Correa were that the solution to the asylum, the Assange since the month of June in the message of Ecuador in London was granted, the granting of a Freibriefs after Ecuador, and he could travel, and that in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities Europe 's. He emphasised that it with London talks have been a solution to the captive founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with the human rights, this word for this case we are not, however, there have been ongoing talks.
'The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because of the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a number of procedures in various European bodies', he declared.
If Britain and 'carte blanche to this morning, I believe that this is done. "
And if Sweden Mr Assange on the message of Ecuador in London or interrogated Skype, as the Swedish case law allows and in other cases, is the problem has been made.
Correa used the opportunity to be defenders of the press to confirm and said that what he does not tolerate, 'the mediocrity, the sinister intention and the lie, the freedom of expression'.
'The greatest enemies of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail', he said.
In this sense, he is happy that Ecuador not more of these journalists' and not of the bankers or hegemonic and dominated spießbürgerlichen countries', and that it took away in a re-election 'the revolution will deepen the way to continue in the right direction'.
Correa also supported the decision, the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism 'tough must remain, and no opportunism and not as legal verkleideten coup must grant', because it 'the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay' has been destroyed.
The President of Ecuador also the desire of his Colombian Gegenübers, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua seerechtlichen bevorteilte the borders between the two countries to negotiate 'for' is absolutely justified.
This judgment is currently not being implemented.
It is a problem between a southern and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must in the pursuit of a common path to be overcome.
They must be dealt with, so that they will be overcome and can look forward.
He also had a good conclusion of the disputes over the borders between Peru and Chile in the same Court of Justice and said that 'it is right for Latin America, international bodies of Justice, if both countries to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard'.
In relation to the possibility that it as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, for his third term in consequence, he admitted that he this possibility 'with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult.'
Correa assured that, if he could lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from the political life.
Has never makes me personally, but under such unjust circumstances such as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
'My political movement had the belief that it was I who these likely victory guaranteed, I must, therefore, this responsibility', he said.
If I win, it would be my last period as President, then I retreat from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
'That is decided', he declared.
Correa also adopted on the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just with the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he for a planned, routine treatment, and that he went to have expected that he would again after the election campaign could travel to Cuba.
'It is in any case a relapse in health status of President Chávez', he commented.
Today the Ecuadorean Head of State adopted on 6 in Lima Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), with the call for greater regional integration has been completed, in order for a sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of a death because AIDS is today a late diagnosis
Mr Fabrizio was 21 years old, when he was confirmed the outcome: HIV-positive.
'It was as if a bomb hit', he says about the moment, in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without visible sign of success' tried to '.
He hidden it before his family.
He decided to itself to his illness and has begun to take care to be informed; and this with such commitment that he has just celebrated its 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV-Einheit of the hospital patients of the Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after many struggles in 1994.
Mr Fabrizio live with the humane Immundefizienz-Virus (HIV) for 22 years, which initially of the 1990s, as it was difficult to imagine many doubts, few treatment and more stigmas.
At that time avoiding even the director of a clinic of IMSS to adopt, because 'it in a dead end.'
At that time was synonymous with AIDS death.
Today, it is possible, this syndrome also with quality of life to survive.
However, still many people in the hospital, who know nothing of their illness and in which the virus has already damage and their immune system has exhausted, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases' means of the great success today that the survival of the treatment of patients, in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same ', said the head of the HCG HIV-Einheit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information in April this year by a reputable scientific publication has been based.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the year 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence is that, but the years of the survival and the quality of life by the degree of prejudice to the immune system of the people at the beginning of the treatment, and that those who depended have greater opportunities, which are not dependent on drugs: up to 30 years in a sort of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a sort of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above, mean that anyone in the age of 25 years the diagnosis are HIV-positive, in this sense, "can be easily 75 years old, as long as he is under control ', said this expert.
In order to correct this progress must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today, on average, 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS by 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in the year 2011 (annual ONUSIDA)), it is nevertheless true that since the appearance of the AIDS 60% of the national database that patients have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and until the month of May this year there are already 187 deaths; however, rest assured that it, since 2005, universal access to anti-retroviral medicines.
- Why are therefore still people?
- In my opinion, is not the problem of access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years ago we had no problems in the case of medicines. The problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their Infektionszustand, i.e. in a very late stages of the disease.
He makes a resounding statement: 'Nine of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection in order to be able to influence global mortality two diagnoses are needed, which is why all people, where necessary, must be offered screening tests'.
This proposal are the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state Committee to AIDS-Vermeidung in Jalisco) and the patients as Mr Fabrizio to its test in a private laboratory has carried out, and this for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite its young age was already in the AIDS-Phase and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything has changed, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and would like to hear anything.
'If I have to die, then we would rather burst' three times, we say in my case.
The amendment was to towards improvement, I am that drives ernähre, sport and take note of the medicines.
His parents know today that he had only cancer.
I live a normal life, as everyone else.
'I am much, I have an active, but good sex lives, I respect to my health and the other person', is Mr Fabrizio to the agreed to his intimate details with MILENIO Jalisco, in order to share with his testimony to encourage those who, today in the framework of global AIDS-Tages fear.
They should make the test, if they are vulnerable. The sooner they know whether they are positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live as all the people responsible.
Its news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programmes and the ordinary citizens, there are great holes, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which is the cause of HIV has adopted.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In this specific places', the distribution of condoms actually increased; previously they were issued individually, now give us packages with a hundred piece of what is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom ', he said.
To the Risikopersonen for new infections include the young people.
'What need you?' is a widespread Spottfrage Orientierungspersonal in schools, social workers, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, the young people are not want to suspend, assured the correspondent.
He suggested that these inefficient distribution of condoms to orient; the new should not only behind the counter, but in Ausgabegeräten in public toilets of institutions, often of young people.
It is not the promiscuity be encouraged.
They are not the beer and Motel be paid, as the governor Emilio González on the question of whether, under his administration condoms would be distributed.
'sexuality is not enough; it is the best use of condoms, to bring it closer to those already in a sexual activity', he brought it to the point.
Of key dates of Jalisco
There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV).
The state is seen at national level to 4 point of new and cumulative AIDS, and 13 point in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection will remain forever be on sex, 6% of the blood and perinatal 2%.
It is estimated that, 50 000 people living with HIV, because it is for each registered 4 or 5, there are people who do not know.
After the Court of Appeal of the United States a judgment has confirmed that the restructuring of the liabilities of the group vitro fertilization, which does not recognise a Handelskonkurs in Mexico has been achieved is a pernicious precedent for every national companies with establishments in the neighbouring country, which has created Zahlungsprobleme.
One could say that the procedures for the survival of businesses that the Mexican laws allow in the country of the stars and stripes contrary to international agreements have no validity.
In practice on 15 June, the recognition of the judgment handed down by the judge Harlin Hale on court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas, that the Mexican businesses the seizure of property across the river bravo helpless are exposed.
However, the largest Glashersteller decision opens the door in Mexico, for three inconsistencies the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
During the judges of the matter to point out that the creditors the Bankruptcy must be subject to the United States says that the Court of Appeal of the Fifth circuit, based in New Orleans, firstly, that the main proceedings Handelskonkurs dealt with the in Mexico.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in procedures in default by companies which are of trans-national profile is not known.
Indeed, to this end the Modellgesetz of the United Nations for the unification of the international commercial law, with the American Law Institute was used as an arbiter.
Secondly, the judgment that, without the voices of the societies after recognition of the liabilities in the liquidation of the branches of vitro, with its parent company had not the majority required for the restructuring of the liabilities been achieved.

Héctor 'Hetin' Reyes: 'basketball was my life'
The Weltenbummler Basketballs Hetin of Héctor ',' Reyes, was the Korbsport longer than 60 years and has around the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of Basketballs of the country as Héctor 'Hetin' Reyes.
Before it by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, was Rexes 6 years, it is part of the sport as a player lower classes, players in the first National League, authorised representative and head in BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketballverbands.
'My life I have drafted in basketball many hats, even several at the same time, as I was President of the BSN, CEO of the national team and President of the Union in the 1990s was', remembered Reyes in a visit by Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, where he with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
'basketball was my life.'
With this statement not exaggerating Reyes.
The walls of his House are almost all with photographs and memories of its long career decorated and they show.
In the heart of Bayamón
The emotionalsten memories are those in his time in the Vaqueros of the middle of the 1950s when players until 1982, where he 15-year-old anniversary as Director of the club or Mitgeschäftsführer celebrated.
'The were my best years, the most part, because I have enjoyed by eight championships the Vaqueros since 1967, it is as CEO be Mitgeschäftsführer or coach.
There were many rewarding years, including the five championships successive 1971 to 1975.
And then, I am with the championship in 1981, the year of Debüts of Jerome Mincy in BSN.
From then took 'Cuco' Ortiz, a very good administrator was, 'says Reyes.
I remember that genes Bartow me here, as a trainer worked and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m big players.
You do unto him? '
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, Puerto Rico has ever had.
Subsequently the recommended Bartow Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse, and go through naturalisation Werfer was one of our best.
I know, as he said that if a championship Mincy for Bayamon, Gausse for a further.
With the championship the Vaqueros Gausse he was granted, but from a distance in 1988, because it already at the top of the Union.
At this time, he drew its application and the of Mincy to enjoy in the national team.
I remember when the first time, we in the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the US won.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, the fourth place in which we showed what actually bronze ought to be, if not the Canadian referee of us would have been the last Spielzug the second time, said Reyes repeated.
This group of the World Cup was in 1990, the best national team, which you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those which, in the 2004 Olympics against the dream team won.
My favourite is but the team of panamerikanischen Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we gold and the team of the US won a battle, as then, as they are against us in the World Cup bronze won.
In the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Robert Fico López and 'Piculín' (Ortiz) once again, but also the young players (Javier) 'Toñito' Colón and James Carter, the Brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quixote' Morales, the 1990, for a Knieverletzung not been able to be present.
A team, which perhaps in terms of figures was not the best, but with which we won a gold medal us great pleasure and the country, was that of the 1995 in Neuquén vorolympischen tournament ’ s, Argentina.
With players such as' Canito 'Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blockage of players because of the events in the Panamerikanischen Games in Mar del Plata, any prediction, we got to the gold medal.
Who was the best players of Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
Its figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level so as Piculín.
And this without his career in the various leagues into account, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult issue.
We had a number of good coach as Julio Toro, flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys like the work of Leo Arill well.
What is the best glaubst you what you have achieved in the Association of?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 until 1995, which initially BSN the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What remains for you to do?
There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The boys in Ponce for example only play in their territory and only in the national Playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children needlessly many visits and Games.
At least, I see the result of the prescribed and training courses for coach, Tisch-Offizielle and referees.
I am proud of.
What rabbits you today?
I hear music, like to see my time in videos of music enjoy my grandchildren and YouTube, and I am a Basketballspiel.
I enjoy the society and, of course, my wife Isabel, which was always on my side.

'I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste Semester, which it has ever seen' Charmé said this week the university students Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
