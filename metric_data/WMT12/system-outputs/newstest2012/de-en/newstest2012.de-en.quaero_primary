No liberating novella for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused the request, in the context of a revision of the Penal Code to abolish those sections on the basis of the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced.
The new rules, which could have been to the liberation of the imprisoned Expremierministerin members rejected during the second reading of the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced in October because of the conclusion of a supposedly negative treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas to seven years in prison.
The verdict is not yet to be negotiated, in December, the appeal of the convicted in court.
Timoshenko even described the verdict as political revenge by the regime, and also in the West, the process raises the suspicion of bias of the court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Expremierministerin was sentenced to remove from the penal code, was supported by 147 members.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion knows about their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him, the war is over.
Now it is just to define the winner.
As the region usually win in the elections, Islamists, the only question is what the moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council committed itself to the common law of the (a), of which it is now God has a certain idea.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft peck in the hand.
Women should also be concerned about emancipation as soon as possible, any faith apostates executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator society united feuding tribes from the Koran.
In short, in Libya an order will prevail over here barely conceivable and, above all, is hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively, is probably not the best and would hardly fit the aforementioned Libyans. "
In this respect, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters from the infidel dogs help.
Her apology may only serve the fact that the NATO air strikes are not by any General from America, but guided by Allah, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not to do so.
We only took part in a gun battle, served the interests of Islam and our politicians sought in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefer a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the Hiesigen a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
The oil companies but also without occupation the black gold price derision?
Hardly, and so can boast the West once rightly his selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If they do not spoil the Scharīʿa representatives.

The menu of a fettsüchtigen child: it is not eating breakfast and eats supper sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children are overweight.
Recent surveys have shown - obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human environment, where he breeds and the examples are surrounded.
On the tables of adipöser children sausages were up to half more often on the table than in families in which normalweighty children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children were on the eve of the information campaign under the slogan "obesity is not a coincidence" chips for dinner.
In families with Dickerchen also sport not exactly the favorite activities, but also, the majority of today's students - only 15 percent said that their parents at least once a week to find time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, nearly 900 children from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of action "obesity is not a coincidence," which will be supported by the general health insurance company and the company Unilever.
So far, the project is more than 12 thousand pupils from 4th and 8th classes.
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are key factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children who are overweight or obesity.
"Only half of the surveyed children, for example, five times a day, the modus zweites frühstück Frühstück-Mittagessen-Vesper-Abendbrot - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively minor matters, such as the regular breakfast time of the family are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic have breakfast but only 23 percent of the families of the students.
And, in most families, everyone frühstückt for themselves.
The worst was the fact that is not gefrühstückt in every tenth family.
The breakfast is the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test, among other things, the that the families of overweight children consumed more often unhealthy chips.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drink every day sweet soft drinks (70%) 
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed sport, but only less than half of their parents do - only 15 percent.
Just think your own menu together
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), offered opportunities for appetite and view their own menu.
"As far as Czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition, is a far cry from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favourite foods were many flour foods, meat dishes and, of course, fresh food.
"What is alarming is the great popularity of sweet fizzy drinks," in the final report on the survey.
At lunch, the main court, pasta just before poultry.
Pulses liked children virtually nonexistent and the popularity of fish and vegetables courts as lunch was very low.
Hinkehr health
At the same time, the survey showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits, if they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants, the questionnaire after the informative lecture" obesity is not a coincidence, "in many cases, was a significant shift of preferences to principles of healthy diet," is in the results of the project.
This was, for example, in the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The U.S. military in the questionnaire is also much more chicken or fish as a main course of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet foods.
Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how to learn Stylisten, I had a little bit of gemeckert that it was a bit too much for the start.
Since I was not in the least, what is to come.
Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how the "place ."
It is worse to come.
The closer examination, more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course is on Saturdays and Sundays, it is full.
This time we debated with director Alena (the rate is not a single man), as it attracts a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure.
And that is, after all, most of us.
Some people have a short neck, the other a young figure without proper curves and others are mollig.
It is a matter for the Stylisten to extend broad shoulders looks to extend the neck or the necessary hervorzuzaubern curves.
We also got pointers about how to make a Frauentyp like Jennifer Lopez - with a large bosom, wide hip and all slim waists - and attracts figur stressed, without being too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between waists and hips is so great that the skirt or trousers does not really fit, should be at least a piece of schneidern.
This will not regret, because good clothing is simply unaffordable.
In such a tailor-made rock you feel much better than in a bar, the high and verrutscht Taille absteht, etc.
Jungenhafte characters can, in turn, clothing with wrinkles, Bauschen, applications, embroidery or Raffung.
With this amount of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week time I will do everything thoroughly.
And yet, I am afraid that it is almost impossible to achieve in view of the assigned homework.
Each of the rate of a celebrity, for which it is to devise appropriate attire - day clothes and evening gown.
So we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the stars and Figurtyp.
I am supposed to Miranda Kerr ," "you may be out of the campaign, Victoria Secret.
Inside, I juble, because it is much better for me personally, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has grown in recent times, the hundred kilograms (okay, that is a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes we are supposed to from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet, and then represented graphically.
"In the Mood Board, the result is known, then our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the Stylings.
The Stylist models not only physically, but also the so-called product side in the journal (after specific target, for example, handbags, coats, etc.).
They told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But only on Sunday.
This means that a Stylist must have a good overall picture.
With information on the types of characters filled Saturday lecture was tempered by three visitors from the industry.
The Stylisten Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and a Stylist should be able to exploit it.
And eingeschickter Stylist with a single piece of clothing to work in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
You can take, for example, a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, but also on the naked body, paragraph shoes to attract and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up our sleeves and and the whole look is quite different.
"So," he said.
But most came the following advice: "first of all, you know what the rules are perfect."
"Only then can they violate them," said Jakub.
At last, it is clear to me why we need pauken all these theories, which can be combined with what and why, even if you fashion journals often quite different to see.
Not to mention of fashion schaus.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a Stylist much more clothing variant must have prepared than he ultimately photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) to stylen at least 15.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
All of this must be expected in the form of the attire.
That image and sometimes make up half of the success, which also confirmed Jan Pokorný.
Since you need only Madonna, a not particularly brilliant singer from the image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a Stylisten rather reserved.
Well-known personalities, it is often wasted money (the main thing is that I am, as I turned out secondary).
And if anyone stylen from us, then we should expect that he or she is very likely to be a very different (smaller) size than he or she needs in reality.
Then you need only turn to googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press, the appropriate Promi or decreased, and so on.
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday, not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the cloth "to assemble them."
In his work, above all, he needs to communicate with the people, he stylt and he must be a psychologist.
People judge without curry and his opinion.
"If we have in order to sift through their clothes cupboard and to complement fine pieces, then we cannot get rid of the whole storage cupboard and say - my God, this is terrible."
"We must find at least a few worthy things, which recommends what you can do," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what a so-called "pocket" must include.
So a bag of Taille zuknöpft and which carries all the necessary Proprietäten.
But such clear, such as scissors, Abroller to hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such Utensilien a nylon thread (the Stylist helps the photographing of products, such as handbags or hats), specific clips with which the clothes will be accelerated if it is too big (electric nadeln or other Klemmen are banned, so that the substance is not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug.
This means that we must not only listen, but also can try something practical, we learned how to get it right.
In the photography studio, where the floor is, you can damage the shoe base, let alone the outside.
O klebten us and we klebten....
With the gap should not affect the shoes, so that they are not damaged.
So we must be really well.
Mario enjoyed, he praised my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill is not just my strength.
All of this was only a fraction of what we hear on the second Wochenend-Fortsetzungskurs.
One thing is now clear to me - the styling at professional level, is no pushover.
V Need for steroids: "the run" - the illegal race across America
Recession
The original careless journey through a series of completely preventable, amateurish mistakes routine journey to the early class.
It was able to meet the ambitions for the most part, but what is the point, though obviously had no desire to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the counter, the new part with the subtitle "the run" high expectations.
He promised to postpone the game series" Need for speed "bejahrte into a new dimension and in the spielbaren demonstration examples seemed not only one of many Action Rennspielen.
We were also curious as to how the eingepassten passages, in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot.
But how it is used in NFS, is much different than we had expected.
Sure, there are potentially quite decent Arkade race, but overall, the game will be diminished by some unnecessary mistakes in this series, more or less for a few years.
So there are no more mistakes, but rather signs of unbegreiflichen laziness in principle laziness of the games developers.
The adventure begins very well.
Firstly, it will be introduced into the story, whose main character, Jack certain problems of a personal character; the only solution seems to be in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, to the steering wheel - with the task, as the first in New York.
The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into 10 stages and more than fifty individual race.
This means that each race will be fought on the other route and that the various stages in different degrees, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
There is no moment the impression that the game would continue to offer the same thing.
Some areas are still very nicely, even though the technical level of graphics on the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing to write home about.
But the journey through the desert, autumn landscape or high through deep snow landscape we visually very pleasant.
Every now and again bring atypical elements a little change in the individual race.
In the desert, for example, will be surprised by a desert storm, which is the point of view.
In the mountains, in turn, must be extremely careful that we will not be buried by an avalanche.
Incidentally, are fairly well in the individual race.
Only a few, but they are.
For a while trying to overtake the mandatory number of opponents (in principle, a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And also the police, who wants to blow the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animation, in which Jack fleeing anybody else, and where he must help the players, the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there is much less such passages in the game, as one would expect (actually only three).
Ultimately, it is more likely to advantage, because this element has at least a chance to be boring - it is in the context of the above mentioned on the elements that make the game more.
The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen of previous parts.
In other words, from today's viewpoint, no trees, on the other hand, you could not claim that it would be a bad thing.
Anyone who seeks realistic simulations must look elsewhere.
But an aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren, the European Fahrmodell will continue quite well, although we could be in the competition.
In the meantime, so far, everything is fine.
Real problems only after a certain time.
In contrast to the driving model the collision model is not quite OK.
> From a game of this type, it is hard to expect that it is difficult to calculate deformations and collisions, but if you virtually no impact on any idea how the car is, then it is obviously not everything is in order.
A typical example: the close or passing of oncoming cars "touched upon" the other car in some places only slightly in the other, almost identical situation but tailspin and wild performance.
Or the Karre to scrap.
Thanks to the Restart-Systems is nothing more, it is annoying.
The remaining Arts are resolved: if you write-off or far away from the route, then the game back to the last point of reference.
Only - in every race has only five restarts.
If they are exhausted, everything is going on.
The restarts are more such as a tool for the event that something does not succeed, but rely on it should not.
Sometimes, however, does not help the Restart, there is nothing else helps to learn the critical section from the head.
It is extremely unfortunate that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves must be, for example, in a very specific way, otherwise it is not easy.
Elsewhere, the appropriate place "civilian" cars are always in the same configuration, no matter whether it was the first or fifth, five seconds sooner or later a minute.
This is particularly galling in situations when we see that the opponent before a romped to two oncoming cars, but even there, the cars are already in such a position that they must avoid or delay.
And it does not matter when you arrive, everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
In the game, there are a few places where you are always in the same place will be overtaken by the same opponents, and again without regard to the timing.
The most madman's is at the end of the game on the long bridge, which is happening in the opposite direction.
The opponent must seem hell bent on overtaking.
And if he is already facing a, then he is the point of view, of course, so that they their own car a few times in Klump.
Clearly, we want to make the game simply more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that they quickly spoiled the joy of the game.
And that is a pity, because despite einfacherem model is the game as a whole rather entertaining and sometimes action that you almost no longer know where it is one of the head.
And, in principle, no matter what "guilt" - the concept of fifty unique routes, the Order of the race in a way that no boredom can boredom, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change in the course of the race.
We must not overlook garages, because it is precisely here that we can change the car, even though in most cases, the car is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the highways and exotic sportwagen for the technical crews, for example, on the Serpentinen in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the history of the game is also the aufgaben mode (challenges) - the race in the individual which we know from history.
This is not just medals, but also to gain experience points for their own profile, the common tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to achieve higher driver, must be open to various objects: from the car to the baker's grounds for the profile.
This is at the same time, the role of online Autolog which, among other things, its own results compared with those of other players, and also provides for more collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible Schnitzers is a situation in the last race of the story.
This is the car in a subway tunnel (a), where in the dark on the rails long (a).
On the tachograph paragraphs between 150 200 km/h (say), but there is an underground and an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial, we will still argue about whether this was a blackout of game makers, or whether the authors for so stupid.
The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall impression is, in most cases, appealing, and here and there, even brilliant.
It is all the more galling is that in a few exciting moments, the wiederhol rate is slower, and sometimes quite dramatically.
This is particularly the accidents with greater numbers of do, where a continuous FPS anyway.
The Tonwiedergabe is OK, and the sound track is a matter of taste.
In a bid to such a broad as possible rather young audience, a sound track a lá "of all things" - but who is buying such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for steroids: The run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game does not mention totally unnecessary mistakes, we would have been able to argue with a true ring of conviction that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But the game somehow unfinished.
For a great pleasure, but we should be prepared for the fact that these mistakes with the power of airport lights in the eye.

EU ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has upset the balance among the various institutions felt out the road."
I would not have expected that there is such a hard war flares. "
"It will take five or six years, until the dust settling, and all have become accustomed to their new role," began girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, its presentation at the law faculty.
How seriously the motto, "this is understandable and openly about Europe," it has already been demonstrated in the first part of her speech, in which it was the various institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way to describe some editor of the law faculty of Charles University would have been able to.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy.
"Initially, there was criticism that he is too low-key - a grey civil servant, such a role, but I must say that it has ended up all the time, how well he has taken up the cause.
"It is a man of twenty-seven member states listen patiently to communicate with them, and above all, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security policy, said that the answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number, I call? "as an important step towards agreement and better readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our Ölmützer Quargel
Mrs Vicenová also on the agenda, according to the European Union, and intends to live in the near future.
According to the Czech Presidency of two years ago, describing it as a success.
The Czechs had overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also the summit for the Eastern Partnership.
In the case of the government during the presidency, describing it as a big negative, which severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the ambassador said that it was not only in the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which is not yet overcome quite hectic.
And since the seven-year budget must be approved by the EU, which is precisely because of the current economic situation much more complicated.
Whether it is a slim and economical budget, what industries take precedence, which countries more and less - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls their own slogans with which they came to Brussels: "understandable on Europe."
"If I do not like something, then it is gräuliche acronym, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How can I actually know as citizens, whether they are really in Brussels curved or round cucumbers and other large bananas or whether someone really wants to ban the Quargel.
It would have used the territory of the European Union in order to get more Czechs in European institutions.
The Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics more negative than positive aspects of the story.
All the more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
There are many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, whose inability to motivation to write letters and, last but not least the weak support for the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, they also have the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian comes to me and, in the vicinity, then the Frenchman next to me:" Hey, what is the heads together - that is your V4? "and makes a pretty sour face.
Mrs Vicenové according to expect the EU in the future, especially tough rules for the budget policies of the member states.
As a much fairer, as a "European federation" is the concept of an Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro zone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute encourages cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only those countries should work together, and it does not want to out."
"It will be more and more of these institutions, which at the end of a strong" multi-speed Europe ," "expects Mrs Vicenová.
In this respect, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues with impact on the entire EU must be discussed by all member states, and not only by the countries of the euro zone.
Fire story:
The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence
If you are looking for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM most closely, then this would be the word "longevity."
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, we know it as a modern company, even though a century has passed since its inception.
The basis for this longevity has been its first chief - the visionary Thomas J. Watson,.
He was the slogan, countless global problems could easily solved if people would be willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" has become the hallmark, which should take the life of the future giant (and, at the same time, the title of the company's internal magazine, IBM in the year 1935 began).
This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means that long-term thinking is a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also an entire century successful because it has remained true to its principles and not shied away changing everything else around it.
This allowed us, in the course of our first century, the technology to transform the business and society.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Thought-out system
Watson was already in the 1930s social care of its employees - in a similar way, as the entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had as one of the first American workers paid holidays, an insurance through the entrepreneurs, plus elegant uniforms and working clothes and a reasonable salary system for best innovators and traders.
Equally sophisticated IBM long-term relationships with their customers.
The company was brilliant from the outset in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM any discrimination - and could pick and choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the head of IBM in the next year will be swapped seniority by a woman, Virginia Rometty.
It is already 30 years at IBM, so far, the position of the Vetriebs, marketing and strategy manager.
IBM makes so-called online brainstorming in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - ideas, it is enough, the company is almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their steadfast position in the Business guaranteed the company a strong image and domestic and foreign.
"From the outset, IBM is the concept of an institution than a mere technology company," said the Economist, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company, the business problems with the help of technology helps resolve," said George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.
The company pointed out, there is a difference, only to be present on the market or directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logos because of the family "Big Blue ," has grown up in a century to one of the largest companies in the world.
It is one of the militaries technology companies - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the American technology companies IBM has the most patents and five of its staff were awarded the Nobel Prize.
Among his best-known inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swaps, bar code or the diskette.
With approximately 220 billion stock market value (market capitalization) this year, IBM was the second major technology company (after Apple), but it was the first time since 1996, Microsoft took over.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of the customers of today - were unhappy with its own operating system, OS / 2, the online service, for example, or even the IBM PC computers jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so we should not be emotional attachment to the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem to build its foundations on various platforms - and if they do not work, they also leave again.
In contrast to the rival Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
The profits of IBM in the greatest degree of services, software and hardware to participate in a fifth.
It was still 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share.
Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit abwerfend assets with a value of $15 billion in the same time, however, 58 billion dollars in the future technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept over the world.
Here, too, IBM was the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, in the middle of the global economic crisis increased its investment.
So far, it appears that the company IBM today's crisis.
The value of the IBM shares increased since 2008 rocket by 120 percent and the profit of the company kontinuell grows.
The company slogan of IBM: everything can change - not only the values.
For that reason, it is to be expected that this flexible giant pulls off the next crisis.
IBM history: from cheese Schneider to space flights
A hundred years ago, society founded in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
According to the name IBM took until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a plant in Canada and South America.
According to the foundation for the subsequent society IBM, the merger of four companies, whose history dates back in the 1980s of the 19th century.
They had technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren registration work begins and endes.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, until 1930, the chair of the board of directors.
And it was Flint, the head of the rival firm Thomas J. Watson, so that helped him with the management of the company.
This Leader, then even the founder of IBM in the shadow - Watson's ideas based on the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM began, as the name tells us, in the manufacture and distribution of all sorts of machines for the trade - -und sausage schneidern cheese to go.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he has doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company expanded gradually on all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he was all for forty years in the chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson junior.
Under his stewardship IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first Programmiersprache.
In the 1960s helped technicians and computers from IBM to launch flights into space - the Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969, the famous flight of people to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM in 1964, the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System / 360.
A classic PC, the computer standard of that time came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
Twenty years later, IBM veräußerte computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, they bought the mom-and-pop part of the company, PricewaterhouseCoopers and jumped wholeheartedly into the business with Consulting benefits and services with high added value.
The strategy, IBM is paying off in the last three years, is the concept of "smart planet."
It is the intention to use technologies intelligent in hitherto not planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in transport and urban management.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently setup the platform "Smarter Commerce ," which is intended to help the dealers to take the whole trade cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Back in 1932, IBM founded a branch in the former Czechoslovakia - was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR is, among other things, a strategic outsourcing Center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe moved in Prague and is also a top world-class that deals with the technology of voting identification.
Darina Rychtářová over their forsaking Gatten:
Iveta - this donkey can keep you, I do not want him more!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is over.
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), their lover, Darina still hope that Josef from his rosy dream and come home.
But it is now, finally, with the patience and for the life she has clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtáová singer I. Bartošová refuge in her own house, she would probably not even dream, like that with her husband.
As Iveta at their urging, after 30 days and back to Říčany, Josef was the same.
Indeed, he confessed publicly that they love.
At the time Darina resigned, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her relinquishing man - but it gave him the sack.
Rychytář it does not matter, with whom his wife is sleeping
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not open arms.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide its days in our common home, then I will not chase him."
"It is not to be loved, strays old donkey, but as a person, and I still have some ties," Mrs Rychtářová betrayed; but they also said that she had separated from him emotional and insist on mutual decency.
The fact that he Darina the back door locked, Josef has so far with dignity.
"I respect the decision of my wife."
"I stand with Iveta, nothing will change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company is ongoing, I am concerned about the repairs, the garden, I make purchases."
"With Darina I am quite normal, only the bed we do not share," said J. Rychtář (leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, then he would not prevent them.
"We do not sleep with each other, so I don't care whether she has a friend or who it is.
It is clear to me that this is my fault, I was in love with Iveta and therefore I accept any responsibility.
The worst female vices: what is it with you?
If the men to give some typical female vices, they invariably shake some promptly from the sleeves.
The women, you see in the following lines, in which a few Unsitten review, the men's blood in the cold?
Shopping addiction
If her husband to be shopping addicts?
Do you have to buy at least a weekly?
Do you like to shop and to be a little more?
It is in your case a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping to or less under control.
But hand on heart, what is already in the search for a good clothes from a clothes shop on bummeln, and not all (in every possible colour combinations) in the booth?
Even if the shopping is a hobby for most women for the men, it is often the pure hell.
They have, but how often she said her husband - you really be outside...
Constant discontent
"I am not too fat?"
"I would have to buy at least five kilos - I should start to go jogging or Gymnastik?"
"I liked you?"
If they sounds familiar?
Yes?
Then you belong to the women who are obsessed with how they look.
This is not a long time ago that you should go, but many men have an allergic reaction, if their wife whinges about their appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints are women always unverträglicher.
Order and cleanliness in first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Windows, tiles and dust, the bath scheuern - and this at least twice a week.
Schimpfen you with their partner, because he once again with dirty shoes trample on clean tiles, you chastise the children, because it gescheuerte washing basin is already an and because the glass door in the living room cabinet has been fingerprints that extrapolate so much trouble?
If you are under this kind of "Devianz," then you should know that we should not exaggerate and order and cleanliness in family life does not in the first place.
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can harm the mutual relations and, above all, the rest in the family.
Sticheln
"Dirty Turnhosen in the laundry basket."
"Do you want to attract the old socks really attract tomorrow?"
"A watery towel is not simply on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that he brings to the Palme.
It is not a bad thing, but they want all his order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not be so much to grumble.
Gossip and novelty
Some women clap and tratschen, behind the backs getuschelt or even slandered or forge alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to make such issues, such as, for example, - who, where, with whom, how and why.
I think each of us has a little harmless gossip and novelty at camp.
Hand on heart, that is all women.
But this is not to be confused with gossip aunts gross calibre, whom nobody and nothing is sacred, I think everyone in their environment, and particularly for women pose a significant risk.
Jágr and Voráček gave Philadelphia with their Assistenzs victory
The ice hockey striker Jaromír Jágr had in Monday's game in the NHL with two Assistenzen large share of the 5:3 victory in Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and again by produktivster Czech player in the NHL.

That somehow I had the feeling. "
"Every now and again, such a feeling," Jágr said, after its action Giroux has already been achieved in the first shot of the Flyers a goal.
A bit later, the second hit "a Czech trail."
Voráček won behind the door of the Hurricanes Puck and presented him between the circles the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the final whistle of the first third of the home players Patrick Dwyer a Short Hander, but the second half belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr he reached his third hit, then drew Wayne Simmonds whose shot on the fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I do not want to say that he is the best player in the league, but he is one of the best three," Jágr paid tribute to his Center.
"I would not be in life that I finish my career with such an ice hockey player games, such as with him."
"I am pleased about this huge."
"I am raising my game to me."
"All the years in the NHL my players their game to me and now revolves around the tables," schmunzelte Jágr.
Carolina was playing for the drama - by the hit of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who is from a criminal, it was a goal.
Matt Read prevented any further complication, in which he was successful in majority two against one.
"Excellent acted Pronger in our zone."
"He got off the Puck, I took on and (Read) preferred to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him, and I am glad that it has worked," Voráček described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
With this victory, Philadelphia at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defensive players Montreal Jaroslav paek injured in the game against Buffalo and left in the second half because of a violation of the upper body.
The Candiens losing about alongside their experienced Beck their leadership, an unverloren in Penalty 2:3.
One of the criminal shootings could not turn Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points schmerzten, the coach of the home team the high sick absence on the defensive - the game they played with only five defensive players.
"This is a bad thing."
"The meeting we played only with a single experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing we can do, so we must be ready," said Jacques Martin.
"With every change a wave of attacks after the other, and we had nothing."
"We would have to make the game easier and Puck away from our third."
There was still room for improvement, "said P. K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec rejected thirty shots of Tampa Bay and contributed greatly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended with a series of five defeats, had five different shooter.
Development of the travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five in the then ČSSR authorized state travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agents at the time, above all, sold only travel in the socialist Eastern bloc countries in the West at that time were chosen.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea), to the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania and Hungary to the Balaton.
A silver exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia proposed a pro-Western course, and that is why were severely restricted the trips to Yugoslavia.
It was a great paradox of the socialist times that it was not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland, for example, or even wanted to travel to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise were individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies offered trips to the West, but had to be huge queues or even in the sleeping bags before the travel office, or at least "good friend" in the travel office.
So the matter was still a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - was only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The czechoslovak currency was not free umtauschbare currency without foreign exchange promise, it would have been impossible to make the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The long journey most Czechs therefore spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that the Czechs countless weekend bought homes and dachas - a habit that has lasted until today.
The Velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, the Czechs spent last year, 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries of the world.
An enormous paradox today is no longer conscious at all is the fact that the currently popular holiday destination of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 could not travel at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
> from the beginning of the 1990s in the last century, the foreign exchange requirement lifted in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, a huge wave of short visits to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken could have a long time of their trips to the West simply enough, everyone wanted at least a few days there have been.
For example, the Czech holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature on foreign travel by Czechs was a with canned beer and sausages, etc. vollgepackter boot.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally free to buy the Western currency.
Our standard of living and the average salaries rose to 1997, which einmündete in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to travel agents after 1997 regularly travel by charter flights, which makes the air travel, thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payments with all the advanced countries in the world, which travel more easily.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "velvet" travel came in the year 2000, when, thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight was processed in an exotic country - after Thailand.
Since then, every year to fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in far-off sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel each year in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the era that our "post-revolutionary" marked development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country brutalized for daring definitely among the advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history for a single holiday residence, including the cost of the holiday more than 15 CZK per capita.
The main assembly is to find a new chairman - a stalemate.
Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman and that the successor of Ivan Hašek will be at the head of the Czech football Association (FAČR), not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk known.
To date, there is still no agreement on how the electoral law is to be elected.
And without, there is no vote on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June Hašek resigned from his post, and his colleagues in the departure had to reach an agreement and to find a strong personality, which could lead to the football in the future.
However, in the era after Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two chambers were once again, unable to agree on a joint candidate.
This was clearly on 16 September, when the new chairman should be chosen.
The delegates of the main assembly were in vain in the People's House in Prague Smíchov quarter, because the trial produced no result, and it was not just about the election itself.
You could not agree on who is entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or officials equipped with a power.
In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for state and law, whose opinion a representation at full power base was not admissible.
The disputes over the electoral law, however, continue to persist.
The executive committee did not bring more clarity on the issue in meetings - no matter whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, nothing else on the agenda.
Even if the views in relation to the election of a few times - the worst point remained the same.
The question is: what should we do in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate?
"The issue is the question of whether we should proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether a different model must be found," said dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAČR, which in the management of the professional football.
According to registered model prevails in the third round of the one candidate who receives the greater disposable support in the chamber, for which he is standing.
Moravia is supposed to be ready to respond to the compromise that candidate win the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, in turn, is on the condition that the victor in this percentage vote count at least a two-thirds majority.
"The two Vorrunden make no sense, this modus operandi would, the entire bicameral concept in question," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, it would be best not to bend the electoral law, but to choose under current statutes.
Surprisingly, this is also true Tomáš Paclík, even if it seems that the statutory order of all the candidates most likely Pelta.
"My wish is that as much as possible will be in accordance with the statute."
"This is no nonsensical ersatz variants to be invented, as in the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football clubs) Victoria Plze, who is standing for the first time, above all in its opinions from to Pelta.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his opinion, will be known in Nymburk the new chairman, and he believes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European football championships today would certainly help to calm the emotions."
"If the football on the euphoric wave, it is also the willingness to cooperate more," said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten has the most experience on both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, ambivalent."
"It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts, the rules for their own purposes" fudge ." "
"That is why it is not ruled out a new blockage in the main assembly."
"I hope that common sense prevails in the end," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time for the agreement of all sides.
Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generals until the qualification will be at all.
The charter plane, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction at all and so feverish for an alternative option as a part of the executive committee to get to the site of the Barrage-Hinspiels.
Ultimately, it is surely the meeting at ministerial level crucial to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education would have liked to have, the divided parties within the largest sports associations in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of Czech football and also the forthcoming general assembly of the ČSTV, the Czech sport in the financial problems of Sazka's new direction.
Paclík goes in the battle for the position of the chairman, because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting would be able to make a strong candidate all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) have been met, he would have nothing to do with the battle for the top position.
"If there would be a good candidate, then I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation, it is not managed to find an Adepten," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, so it is to prevent the supposed favorites of the election, Pelta, arrived at the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stressed that he if he wins the role of chairman, only one year, until 2013, until the date of the extraordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would like to see an experienced "not too much involved in the football.
"With some of the people I have spoken personally."
"Hard to believe that some people said that they do not want to identify with the Czech football.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
The most of all Paclík alleged Pelta links with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to delegate votes at general meetings.
For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta the position of the chairman.
"His victory would einkonserviert today and in the Czech football, it is not at all."
"The support of Berbr, a cleverem Businessman, would be doubly bad football," said Paclík.
Here he plays that Pelta's name some time ago in connection with phone taps on the investigation in a corruption affair, but from the Pelta unpunished.
"I do not know what the prestige of a victory of Pelta (tsch) should play football."
"And how we would in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club, if Pelta chairman will be," but it looks a little more calmly.
If Paclík in Thursday's election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, had supported the Paclík before the General Assembly in October, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager."
"I am not my nose in matters, which I understand," said Paclík, who was in September for attention that he was behind the recall of the referee Commission with Luďěk Macela at the helm, Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík claims that he felt the role of the association chairman.
And holding up his skills in the management of private firms, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, celebrated with his support in May, the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to do something to change in the football environment, and to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to the disciplinary and appeal commissions, which descends into horrific situations ," which makes no secret of his antipathy for example, to the Sparta leader Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, in which he would evoke the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax in sport.
"This is one of the key things that the new chairman should pay."
"When it comes to the taxation of happiness, such as the political parties, then I understand their reasoning, but they must also be clear where the money is going," he said.
His link to the Pilsner club Paclík is also not a handicap, although he pointed out, the chairman of the FAČR must be "bipartisan."
Pelta, in turn, is linked to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"It is not ideal."
"It is not my opinion but much sense to transfer my shares in Pilsner club hypocritical to a third person to return after one and a half years," said Paclík clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAR ausschlössen a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the chairman, Miroslav Pelta, he will be in the case of his election, that the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law to exclude from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will defuse a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had not realized election in September, he wants to focus in the case of his election to the national team and the extraction of financial resources.
He decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, and it might help him the two-month break, to defend his ideas on the management of football and in a broader context.
"People at all levels dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman on Thursday is known."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone who believes the man who is associated with the Jablonecer club, but also for many years in Sparta and acted in the executive committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.
He is convinced that the current problems with the election of the euphoria is at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, were approved at the general meeting in June, which were not as complete as it had adopted.
If they do not allowed to different interpretations, we would have had a chairman, "said Pelta.
It is the revision of the most important document of the citizens" association he used as bait for the delegates.
"I should be president, then I take it personally, and I am ready to take personal responsibility if it does not work."
"It is a matter of principle, without which he cannot be," said Pelta.
In addition, he is not trying to define his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
It also Tomáš Paclík attack, for a long time, which has no dry thread Pelta.
In football, he has more than a year and can already point to some successes. "
"His attacks were herabsetzend, and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"This is also why many doubt its true nature," adressierte Pelta his opponent, who will remain faithful to its proclamations, which he has already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team.
And this should be the flagship Czech football.
"I would also like to try to put an end to all Affairen - from the fog Bohemians, to the halls of the corruption scandal last year."
"I would like to negotiations with the private and public sector, in order to ensure sufficient funds for the whole of football," said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his arrival at the top of the Czech football will mean no human cleansing.
"I would have been familiar with the content of all employees," he said in Strahov direction, where there is understandably nervous because of the long anarchy.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which accompany the forthcoming general assembly, he believes that the delegates are not in vain on Thursday to go to Nymburk.
"If you really ought to be the only point of contention in the third round, then we will."
"Football needs credibility and he is the only if he finally has a new leader," remains Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR below him to work hard begins
If the current deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl at the General meeting on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected, would this supposed vermiesen many people in the mood.
Rajchl promises that in the event of his election will begin to work hard.
He wants to introduce systemic changes, and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football fields.
He also promised to resolve the case Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into the football and otherwise to continue the work of the previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As chairman, I would like to focus on the football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the national selection, professional football, football for the young people. "
"I do not want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in talks for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the powers of the executive committee that each member pays a certain area."
And I will be distributing tough tasks, so that the football in every segment is moving forward. "
Moreover, many not just delighted, because they, rather than to criticize the work of others, should begin to work really hard, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have not to stand at all.
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."
"But I must know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, I do not use a stick between the legs and every step that I am put into question," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
"Many people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would do it."
"This is confidence that we must not squander," he said.
It is allegedly motivated him, should be able to continue the work he has begun under Hašek.
"In two years we have accomplished a great deal of work and I will not just throw away."
"There have been trials started only in a few years to play, and I would like to see someone cut off," he said, and expresses its concern at the fact that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta elected, the situation could return to the days before Hašek could return.
"I believe in systematic approach, and that is something that does not Mirek Pelta."
"Behind him, above all, people who would make the football so that he would be only for exclusivity."
I think we can accuse some, but not that I would be biased. "
"I am trying to be objective."
"I want football for everybody, because it all goes well, and not just the man," said Rajchl.
It also contradicts the assertion that he was only a leader of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I have to do what is best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and Moravian part, whose winners in each of the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem," said Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík joined the battle for the post of chairman, Rajchl does not have the courage to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has been elected to its deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl led to the saving of tens of millions of kronor on unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations with the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, it is partly the fault of the association was not in a single direction.
While Pelta, he says, "he was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence," he considers the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer.
"No one can question that he Pilsen in just one year has done an excellent job."
"He should be elected, he would probably things continue, Ivan Hašek has begun, and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not fundamentally change."
He would certainly not want to altered just on his favour, "Rajchl ruling on his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Leap in the dark
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken Ufo-Optik, future pools in Budapest: anyone who travels through Europe can be seen blue miracle - and after a city tour or a wandering Sprudelbädern hide behind the tired legs.
A book shows, where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder in the past one and a half years on research trip, was not lacking in their luggage: her bathing costume.
Rücklings on the water, they looked in elaborate domes, they swam Putten marble, they waited in the basin, and was meticulously restored from Jugendstilschwimmhallen.
Gefiel her a bath, she took in her notiz book - all the knowledge worth details about the design and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools answer architecture historian Meder in this way - and it is now in her book "bathing pleasures:" People's swimming halls in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
By 13 countries, their "journey to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe ": in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46 - year-old German is a true Badekultur-Enthusiastin.
In sport, it does not have much in the, says Meder - only in the water is different.
Annoying that swimming fans come with blue Kacheln and chlorine smell, while jogger inhale the betörenden smell of Fichtenwäldern inhale or happy Vogelgezwitscher listening in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I began to collect beautiful baths."
Water doubled architecture
The wellness factor in bathrooms geplätscher in the basin and ethereal sauna oils - is so great, because all sense, so Meder.
And if the builders have been trouble swimming halls can be a real Augenschmaus: "Instead of a floor in dipping water surface."
"It is transparent, on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All doubled blend: high vaults, colorful Kacheln, bretter.
The kleinformatige picture band "bathing pleasures" gives 190 pages of knowledge about the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all, for a leap into the blue.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool Sammlerin Meder with her research in Hungary.
In addition, sumptuous Heilbads such as the 100 years old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest, they found a nitrathaltiges waters in an urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a Thermalbad, whose basin filled with alkalihaltigem water and are in a flaschenförmigen building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular prospects, however, offer many heated pools in Switzerland and Austria, while the Zurich Dachbad the whole city, it is an external pool Bads in St Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg look - and, in the, there is a window from which you can monitor the activities of the Ski-Piste.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design expects bathers in length field: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like an Ufo landed in the Alps.
> From three upwards open Schales dampft in the winter, while in the background, the mountains of the Ötztals out in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
It is not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal spas smell after sulphur in the Árpád-bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba stinks to be so much for fuel oil, which is difficult to believe in a Gesundheitsbad landed.
The smell comes from the alkali hydrogenkarbonathaltigen water, which is almost black and whose silt a stain on the skin, once you slip into the pool - a wellness experience.
In one place was Iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing sites, however, also disappointed: When they free and sun in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz wanted to visit, they found a cordoned off area.
The 1902 by the architect Duan Jurkovic bath has now been closed.
When Meder a glance through the verwitterten windows of the red-Weis-yellow art nouveau building, she saw how weeds between the tiles grown.
It the decline has countered, however, in a beautiful swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais hot springs at Bad Wildbad.
Three construction has this bad already behind; it can detect not only neoromanische elements from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a maurische hall in Alhambra style, which was added in 1900.
Since the 1995 thorough modernization is the Palais hot springs pool kennerin Lieblingsbad iris Meder - and not just because they originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It is quite an achievement, so different Baustile at such a great unity," says Meder.
With such a palace is the Tauchgang in thermal pool only incidental.
Agricultural speculation
German bank leaves commodity business
Christian Teevs
The Deutsche Bank business with agricultural commodities?
According to online information, Josef Ackermann has appointed a working group to examine the impact of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the CEO's wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg.
The matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans for the German citizens find it unacceptable, according to a study that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of respondents want the Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions out of this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest people in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch in mid-October.
It shows the author Harald Schumann, betting on the global commodity markets prices soar - and the banks are partly to blame for the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protection is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley.
Commodity bets were originally intended for traders hedge against price fluctuations.
But now, most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the U.S. competitors Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business is worth it "the good name of the Deutsche Bank to gamble."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE an International working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch Report.
By the end of the year is expected to be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank, with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to tell us what consequences.
In the end, could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann fusses over his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time, however, his criticism of the financial industry: "the betting on rising prices of food particularly dramatic shows how reckless banks today, the common good."
Ackermann stand as a top bank lobbyist now, especially in the duty.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio, where money will be used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"No matter whether it is Mr Ackermann hunger suffering people or the reputation of the German Bank."
The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, it is clear, however, that the CEO's just a few months before his departure from office would like to make a perfect picture.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO differently than planned will not change in the supervisory board.
In a move away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image.
And it needs for possible losses to be little fun - after all, his successor would have to do so.
Every second would cancel commodity crops
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users took part in the campaign of the organisation.
On Tuesday, Bode published the poll, for which the institute Forsa on 7 and 8 November has interviewed 1001 people.
Just 11 percent think it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank facilities, where bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal conclusions when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: Every second, according to the survey would terminate all installations where money is flowing into commodity speculation.
43% would advise friends of such a bank, 49 percent said they consider to terminate their accounts and to switch to another institution.
21er house in Vienna
The umgezogene pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy ending: the Austrian World Expo pavilion from Brussels in 1958 prices, was in Vienna for the museum, was empty and descended.
Now, he is being reopened as an exhibition house.
If dreams of modern postwar architecture, clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, which are typical of the belief in the technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of Karl Schwanzer architects for the Brussels World Expo 1958 is a good and famous example.
Schwanzers pavilion at the Eurovision Song Contest Architecture for his easy and steel glass design.
The building is seen as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that at the next World Expo in Austria pavilion built.
With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich, he became internationally famous.
His temporary Ausstellungsbau planned pavilion of the world Expo in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South station converted and in 1962 opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20s home" has been called it.
This was the building but neither physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it has been used for so long, until the contemporary art in Vienna, a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz converted the pavilion, he is now "21er House" and will in future be used as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday night, the museum opened Belvedere, which includes the house, where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect.
The new start Agnes Husslein-Arco, the 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, doctorate art historian with considerable career, among other things, in the youth as Eiskunstläufererin later with Sotheby's, the Guggenheim museum and founding director of the museum of modern Salzburg, strongly defended the with politicians and conservationists monument, they acquired public funds and private sponsorship money and use.
Besides contemporary art works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the eponymous foundation, a café and a bookshop, it should be, and an office house had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
The implementation was Krischanitz the ideal occupation.
It is not only because he Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive converted and enlarged and had won the competition, but because he Schwanzer has studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him, "enormously important place ," where he" almost every weekend "the exhibitions.
He knew the draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost.
In the current restructuring, there were far greater problems: the building was "an Energieschleuder," says Krischanitz.
The profils windows were replaced outside glass fibre verstärktes insulating glass and the glass roof replaced by special security glass.
Kältebrücken steel girders have been strengthened or replaced, and asbestgefüllte blankets have been refurbished.
Two shells made room for the new use, an abgesenkter light gap between house and road for the Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the easy Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors are left, the house is removed in the old rotbraun Rostschutz-Farbton.
And the cinema is even exactly as it was before.
And all this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found, which is a good thing, and it is cheap and Denkmalschutzamt liked," says Krischanitz and highlights an abrasive soil in -.
Despite all the constraints, problems and to the building is flexible and easy.
It would have been difficult with the pavilion, "the came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical "drop in history."
So an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "create a real awareness."
In this case, the 21er house but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban fluke: if the Swiss garden is completely new planned "Central Station Quartier," with office and residential buildings.
And another stroke will occur: the 21er house could increase by another Krischanitz construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall, and we hear that they have been negotiating with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
Rail plans winter crisis package in millions
The railway has mapped out a crisis plan, which is to prevent Zugausfälle in winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
It will cost millions.
In the fight against winterbedingte Zugausfälle and delays, the Deutsche Bahn, according to a newspaper report this year, more than 70 million.
The "picture" newspaper reported earlier, citing a company internal krisen plan, by 2015, investments by a total of around EUR 300 million.
This should be achieved a better availability of vehicles and rail network in extreme Witterungen.
Is planned, among other things, a doubling of the internal and external staff for snow removal on rail facilities and rail increase to 16000 people.
The aim is to train up to the start of the year and 90 percent of the necessary choices within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, rail chief Rudiger pit after a top-level meeting with government and industry Zugausfalls and delays in this winter.
Last winter, the railway passenger transport significant problems, since it has, among other things, difficult weather conditions, a lack of reserves.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for years for a licence from the Federal Railway Administration.
In addition, there is a delay in the extradition of ICE-Zugs.
The railway also makes for years to create that they are axes of ICE trains significantly more frequently in the workshop, after an ICE in Cologne Central Station had axes.
Deutsche bank pays millions of punishment in the United States
After the uproar over boss Josef Ackermann is new hardships from the United States: the Deutsche Bank must pay a million repentance.
As if the problems at home for the Deutsche Bank were not enough, the industry giants, now his past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison of $145 million (106 million euros) to settle disputes because of the collapse of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA raises a whole series of big banks, cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they have played down the risks.
Such papers lost during the financial crisis and the banks in depth.
"We are pleased that we have been able to resolve the issue without the parties had to go before the court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank admitted no fault with the comparison.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed itself to the payment of 20.5 million dollars.
The NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the cooperation of the two houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the banks and jumps in order to protect the customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the billions of dollars of damage.
The now closed comparisons are the first of its kind.
The regulator had also attacked other big banks, and in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The questionable mortgage Securities in question are so-called mortgage backed Securities.
These loans are based.
When the housing bubble burst in 2007, it was a wide range of financial firms to the disaster.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers.
Even if the events of a few years ago, a strong wind blowing the banks in the United States.
Investors and regulators have brought numerous appeals, in order to obtain compensation or to punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest complaint wave.
It raises 18 major international banks, the two state US-Immobilienfinanzierer Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage transactions in the volume of around 200 billion dollars to have taken advantage.
The Deutsche Bank also to a complaint from the FHFA, it is about several shops worth a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The regulator demanded that the Frankfurt for "substantial losses ," without specifying an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and want to defend themselves.
Warren Buffett is rising with 10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett invested heavily in IT companies IBM.
Since March he has bought in the value of more than 10 billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett always said, not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the firms only bad forecast.
Now, however, he read the reports from IBM and changed his mind about investment in the industry.
He had much earlier must understand that IBM implied in particular services and computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is regarded as a slap in the financial world.
As a result, the it primitive IBM now "Sir IBM."
Because Buffett revealed in the U.S. broadcaster CNBC that he bought since March IBM shares in the value of 10.7 billion dollars.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM previously knew anything about the commitment.
He praised the management, even in the economic crisis had not yet provided for decent profits.
"You have done an excellent job," said Buffett, on the strategy.
IBM has for a long time on the lucrative IT services as the operation of data centres.
More than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice, as well as powerful corporate computers.
Buffett had shunned technology companies shunned until now.
He says he only invest in companies whose business he also understand.
Instead, Buffett, for example, in a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or mechanical engineers.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns alongside around 80 own subsidiaries also shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81 year-old person had developed in the 1960s, the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway and with wise investment to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, is his modest lifestyle.
It is for many investors around the world, a cult figure.
His almost unmistakable sense for making money has given him the moniker "Oracle of Omaha."
After the announcement of Buffett investments, the IBM-Aktie vorbörslich rose by one percent.
"Big Blue ," as IBM is known, is in the stock market as a whole, more than $220 billion worth and counts along with Apple and Microsoft, the most valuable technology companies in the world.
In the case of Microsoft, Buffett said, but he did not want to their own.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is real
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media cast doubt on the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology," which is now auflebe again.
The murders of eight Turkish and a Greek small entrepreneurs in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news will be in Turkey and in the Turkish population in Germany reacted with fear and concern.
For many German türken returns with a long totgeglaubtes ghost: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with extreme right-wing background against Turks.
The fact that in Germany, there is xenophobia, however, was never in question.
The right-wing extremist network reveals, however, reveals proportions, whose dimension is still a long way.
"The bloody ideology?" the headline on the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haber Turk. "
The newspaper Sabah, however, stressed that one of the perpetrators has been a V-Mann of the constitutional protection, and expresses concern that German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.
Besonnen responded to the Turkish community Germany: remembered at the weekend with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier had thought the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish anwerbe agreement.
The was orchestrated in cheery colours - as a history of success.
As a slap in the face, because the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the umpteenth" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," which cites the background of the series of murders.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" it is not to be linked.
"It starts to stink," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people have been murdered, the taxes paid and with their work is an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany had done.
It will be extremely critical in Germany's Turkish Internet forums, the actions of the police and their later investigative success.
Why the German authorities would not have much more to look in extreme right-wing circles for suspects, the authors were surprised.
Some shows, at least rhetorically committed to drastic measures: "will continue to be done carelessly, the migrants do nothing other than the defense and the armed forces."
"This will probably be the best protection."
"The quality of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the internal peace in Germany," writes "selenium."
What does it mean if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks demonstrated by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that can lead to mistrust and distance in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, the attacks we sense on the Turkish side.
The mistakes of the past are not repeated
In the Turkish press was particularly at the time, above all, the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, however, represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the funeral in Cologne - Kinkel was in his speech on how many charges, the local Turks.
So, as berechne the value of a human being, according to the size of its tax revenues.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the rule of law.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive education and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany needs open words.
The Bank of Zürisee
The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since stumbled from one crisis to the next.
Now it is to be a German.
It was not thought Axel Weber.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was reported in July that he 2013, an almost equally spectacular new job: President of the Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was celebrating publicly praised Switzerland their beauty and UBS whether their newfound solidity and kind remarks about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has managed the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A trader of UBS in London had bypassed all security systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland praised bankers had to go.
President of the board of UBS, since also - and all ask: when will finally Axel Weber?
It became known that Weber, the bank of February 2012.
And the administrative presidency in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber will be hard.
He is not a banker, economics professor and central banker, and would have had an apprenticeship period certainly needed.
At a stroke, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again that they have long been the title "the greatest scandal bank of Europe ."
On the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, is the once proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften Swiss Vermögensverwalters she had combined with ambitious goals: they also wanted to be in the investment banking is a very large number.
The UBS managed in 2007 with $1.6 trillion more money with significant customers than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, it was as investment bank proceeded into the league of the world's largest banks.
This made sense.
The former banker and subsequent long-standing banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger told: "I have the UBS was regarded as a model of a good bank."
"From today's perspective, one wonders: how could I be wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was the first time that something went wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli, which was, as highly intellectual and equally brilliant bankers.
A few months later, suspecting, why he was gone.
The investment division of the bank had been gambling found with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder, UBS announced a capital increase of as much as 13 billion francs.
But was actually investors, however, some of which until shortly before the nose would have been gerümpft: an obscure Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was so quiet that not even his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, there have been worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, board President Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second-best paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, followed by the disaster: the UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The National bank of UBS bought problematic securities for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a mandatory convertible loan, on which it could be Miteigentümerin of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she saw how dramatic it is for a small country, if it is so big banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of UBS in 2007, more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," banking researcher says.
The first disaster was the second.
A few months later surrendered the UBS tax dispute with America and agreed to publish the data high-net-worth customers who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
They also agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars as repayment of unjustified profits from this business, including criminal premium.
In doing so, the UBS known more or less open to have helped in terms of tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in the competition for wealthy clients: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of CEO and board President.
And the exodus of customers" money.
For example, the bank within a few months their credibility lost in two key portfolios: investment banking through speculation and asset management with the help of tax evasion.
And it was a little calmer, just when it was thought the UBS will now have to get it again, there is this unfortunate dealer history: an individual trader EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank notes that something is amiss.
And it is obvious that the risk management in the investment banking, it is still not clear.
"With the case Adoboli has found that the risk control too little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial chief of a large German bank is safe: "the problem of UBS is that it does not have the risk control under control."
It was is the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers were lined up for a long time, the guardian of the great wealth of the world: no great risks for safety for money - may want to collapse the world on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The vaults of Swiss banks had become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the upright Swiss private bank - it is just a little bit bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich station road, which leads from the main train station from directly to the Zürichsee, flanked by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Juweliere like Tiffany is taking place here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks: the National Bank on the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bear.
The UBS reception hall enters through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are Drinnen marble, thick leather armchairs, alongside the bank logo is a great sign for the "safe ."
The UBS knows what the customer wants: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank have both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank.
His name, he would not like to read in the newspaper, finally, does he, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks.
The UBS had become far too big, he is taking place - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And if they have long been adapted to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS, its first high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost in the jungle lost so much money as the big Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was visible.
"On that Wednesday, the coalition government of the small Siebenmillionenlandes the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "the UBS-crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly EUR 45 billion devoted to the politicians, in order to save the big bank facing bankruptcy.
How did it happen?
When you talk with Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks, with a huge corporation.
It was a bank in the merger was too big for the small Swiss - and grew more and more.
It helped that the two different precursor banks UBS: a rich, but verschlafene bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but more internationalized.
Suddenly the internationalised favourable investment bankers at a lot of money with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, head of UBS, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, higher intellectual, modest, understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the hard man of the bank and has worked at the top."
But in the end Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: "He thought his models are the reality," He says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.

Smart crow in cities
In many places, Saatkrähen are seen as "problem birds," but from the cities of the highly intelligent animals no longer drive for a long time ago, experts say.
Some people, they may want to get rid of the other very quickly: Krähen for centuries are part of the city, but in many communities there are mounting anwohner complaints about dirt and noise of the animals.
It is a means to the "birds" not yet in sight.
Saatkrähen are no longer out of the cities, said experts at the first crow symposium in ostfriesischen Leer.
They consulted experts from the entire federal territory on possible ways.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Conservationists led the problems in towns and cities to the abandonment of the most protected krähes seed: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly the traditional habitats.
The hunt, increasingly building and the cases of typical trees breeding birds made life difficult.
Crow are under the protection of nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding mate, among other things in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among other things, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
It was in 2005 a controversial project to mass killing of crow in the district of negative headlines.
Critics had called the trapping of animals in bird traps and deployed with cudgels described as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the Vergrämen, nothing," said the city and landscape Werner Klöver from Leer.
Nests with water or trees, often have undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred emperor from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are made up of large colonies divide and spread to other areas."
Vergrämung only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we will no longer."
Without the surrounding area will not solve the problem in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang waiter from Leer.
It could be a combination of Vergrämen animals from sensitive residential areas and offers to resettle them elsewhere.
"Information boards instead of chain saws," against the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta Maria Jürgens for an entirely different approach to the animals: "a Pickel in the face, we can best endure self-confident."
Jürgens had in Schleswig-Holstein the ash Krähen-Lehrpfad, which notices about the lives of the highly intelligent seed krähes.
The project will now have already adopted by tourists.
In addition to the criticism of the noise of the birds Jürgens had its own opinion: "there is a lot of communication, which have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Saatkrähen not only use tools to come to a biscuit, but as a tool of their tool even themselves.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge tested recently at four Saatkrähen, how far the intelligence of the birds.
In one experiment the birds quickly learned that they must bring down with a structure so as to arrive at a motte larve.
Without much training, they determined the size and shape a stone to the platform collapse.
In a second attempt to solve the smart crow a trickier problem.
In a vertical set, the researchers placed a small Eimerchen with a Mottenlarve.
The birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had them pieces of wire.
It shaped all four animals a snag, with whose help they will be the eimer angelten at the top of the.
Three of the four Saatkrähen were even at first.

Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive and generous begins Peter Englunds new book "beauty and horror. A history of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of players to heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: Cut off the side of caution and make it to your readers.
They are the people in Englunds romanhafter narrative know each other very well, and these people as your GPS function as a beacon in these few moments, in which you as Englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and are deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature.
He has written an unusual book that he was not incorrect as "a work of anti-history."
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There is little ambassadors, racing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was." it is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and sentiments."
"Beauty and horror" almost war experiences of 20 more or less concealed men and women on both sides of the war of school girls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some prisoners of war, lose limb, crazy or die.
Each of these lives flackert such as the Votivkerzen in a church, some, while others lapse.
Englunds book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrected the idea that the First World war was just the devastating war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" with experts on other war zones: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are bees baskets, celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is a very moving book almost from the outset.
The war flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina, which reeks of Kordit.
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with their children, and cannon fire in the distance. You or you take the flight?
Who is at all?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"There is a lack of facts," Englund says, "with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and horror" individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard root, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were mainly memories, letters and other already published material.
Their reports can be frightening or simple, but they are very vivid in Englunds of the accumulation of small moments losing in.
Many of them act of shortages and Behelfen.
In the history of a German school girl, he told: "spare everywhere."
"Spare coffee, wrong aluminium, false eraser, paper, wood buttons."
He tells us of the dinner in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and Hammelfett (and most recently was served with a false bones from wood), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato bowls, shoes, which were besohlt with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food substitute foods that were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitute."
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
An American acknowledges his own drive for ferocity and says about the war: "one feels that this is, after all, what was planned for men rather than to sit on the Lehnstuhl, with the evening tide or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and to do so as a front civilisation and as if there were no barbarism behind its own strengthened and keeper shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier acknowledges that he will probably die and nobody notice or will be done.
"If the idea to sacrifice themselves, we would like to think that this is happening before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is so terrible as "a condemned man, who was hanged in secret."
Other observations of the old Europe, which falls apart, and on new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He starts the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the Bestiarium of the young century ":" the word and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick of the slaughter, while he sits behind a desk. "
People behave in unexpected ways, and there are also appears behaviour such as Heroismus.
Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively sought a prostitute being infected with a sexually transmitted disease, in order to escape the front.
"The grotesque expression can be found in trade with Gonokokken-Eiter, because soldiers bought and grease on their genitals, in the hope to come to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate, rieben him in the eye, which meant that they were blind to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is sleek, but intrusiveness and fits perfectly with its human task.
In dozens of small scenes he starts the way, as the war "in an unique way of uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask themselves why their leaders fighting them.
The best books about the First World War were distorted were distorted as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques "nothing new" in the West as a comprehensive history books.
Englunds band is an unconventional glory hall.
His book has the most devastating end, which I have ever read in a book.
I admit that there is no longer.
But it is as if he would have with his book this side of the main people in the nose and lit with a match.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wore use helmets.

The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order, in the park, "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the order, which is a declaration as a "exercise ."
"The few police officers who were involved to my knowledge, did not know that it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wishes to remain anonymous.
"The only people who knew that it went to the Zuccotti Park, the senior officials of the portfolio."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned the city.
On 14 October, officials wanted to remove the park, but differed when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned from these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including Einsatzkommandos from the entire city - hundreds of mobile officials, normally used in high crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that in the course of the day, many people in the park and, almost like commuters, so that 1 o'clock in the night is a good time to go.
"It was appropriate to do so if the smallest number of people in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers blaring prior to the departure of the Pike panties and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in the vicinity of the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the recorded messages from the dröhnten, many of them seemed to intimidate protesters.
The public officials in their bright blue jackets broke into the park, rafften many protesters simply their belongings and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 pm no tents would be tackled, in order to give the protest learning time, their possessions together.
Other teams of officials were seen as they gathered in the vicinity to intervene, arrests should be necessary in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists say that they wanted to prevent them to monitor the police actions in the park, and they said that the handling of the officials was very harsh.
Mr Browne said that television in the Church Street on the west side of the park could have been.
When the police in the West by the great jumble of personal items of the protesters, among other things, Astroturf and bags of clothes, followed by their city employees cleaning untied, what was left behind.
Some protesters, who refused to go were towed out. Images of this has been a short time later on the Internet.
One of the main core of Protestlers was in the vicinity of the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park position.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp did in her arms.
And two people would chain themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officials were called to loszuschneiden them.
As Mr. Kelly said, until around 3:30 no arrests were carried out in the park.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police.
Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests, he said, because of "disorderly conduct and resistance to an arrest."
The most prominent officials on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, divisional chief of Detectives, was also there.
Despite his presence, "Mr Kelly" operation ," as Mr Browne said.
In the event that they should use a second group of officials on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It could be seen from these sites from the police, the around Zuccotti Park, for example, as well.
In one place has been observed, as several officials, many of them with shields, people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 pm jumped to the south of the Pine Street protesters on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air from the tyres of a police bus.
At one point, the crowd threw a piece of Sperrholz.
In the end, a civil servant and a protesters came to the hospital.
The carers union will lodge a complaint against the city because of layoffs
The union, the hundreds of school mentors who have lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies because of their disproportionate influence on the schools, which teach poor students, are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last chance, the union, District council 37, in their efforts to make the redundancies, is still open.
Sechshundert seventy-two school helpers, care coordinators and other staff, among the lowest paid employees of the city, and on October 7 in a move had lost their jobs, the trade union leaders described as a political revenge for that in the last year, the city access to a health fund, the working groups, had with which the budgetary gap should be closed.
This accusation has been categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the city council, said Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools in the last month, the redundancies were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the council shot back and told him that spezifiziere nothing in the budget that the school aid workers would be laid off.
Officials from the City Council 37 said they have warned the Ministry of Education in a complaint, and there will be a press conference on the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will formally announced on Wednesday.
The complaint is Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as a defendant and eight laid-off workers count as plaintiffs, all of which are coloured or Latin American women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said that the city would not be the complaint and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a draft complaint, the New York Times, the union has been on the number of redundancies at the schools in poor neighborhoods of the city, in order to support a complaint for discrimination; they claim that poor schools have lost more workers, because they are chronically underfunded.
It states that, while there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers in District 23 in Ville, Brooklyn, have lost and 46 workers in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were.
With the loss of five of eight school who, in the 36 public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood worried-but-wealthy parents can organise the donations to offset budget cuts."
P. S.: the budget of the 36th Distrikts this year has been cut by 3,26 percent, but it also lost money when the city of its calculation method for the extra funding for any Armenschuleneinschreibung changed.
The union also complained that the head of the high schools by the language in a memo, which approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the act, even if "excess" (German) in the United States usually the change of a teacher from the payroll describes a school in a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office.
"Sechsundsechzig care coordinators have been laid off," says the draft.
Mission ended, Congress prepared to Libya
Ultimately, it is as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington would have to agree on the riots in Libya.
All that was needed to was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and ending the American interference.
On Thursday, the Committee on International Relations of the Senate resolution, which the Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), with Libya for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "courage. ."
"This resolution is a tribute to the courageous people of Libya, which began with the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the debate.
This summer, lawmakers of both parties and the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the role of the U.S. military in the Libya mission to NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain a resolution of the United States, which limited use of military force in Libya.
The law has been in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties, and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this bill in the Senate. The chamber also overruling a decision to cut funding for American operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission ran into a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress, which was enough to criticize Obama's approach in the framework of the mission, but not angry enough to pull the rug from under our feet.
Then the indecisiveness of Congress overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell in August by the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulated the people of Libya to their enormous courage and their extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partners, who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirmed "the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya's transition to democracy."
The new measures will receive the full support of the body for foreign relations or they will divide the legislators, as it did the law in June?
The latest version of the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the spitzen republikaner of the committee.
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional term, Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Good bar (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or any other area at the time to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they tried often enough.
Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes, which were presented to the Congress and include a whole range of issues.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of balancing the budget in the Senate and another dozen "federal spending control ."
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their customers - particularly rookie with the Republicans, who want to burnish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have such a measure "written."
The Budgetary Control Act, which was adopted in August, requires that both the Senate and Congress vote on an amendment to the budget is balanced.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution, which supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want the number of provisions that members of Congress can present limit, while the Republicans José E. Serrano (New York), the limit of two terms of office of the president wants to lift.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments, which, among other things, the right to a good education and health care.
An amendment, which prohibits a marriage under Gleichgeschlechtlichen, as well as an amendment, which prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring presentation.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws, if two-thirds of the states they reject.
For example, how to move the changes so much faster than in the past few years.
In the 111th Congress legislators 77 such changes, presented in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly more than 150 amendments proposed every two years, according to the figures, which the Senate library is available.
But they were not much more successful than today's.
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to the Congress in 1789.
," but not defeated, "Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man in the near distance during an election meeting in Tucson had shot at them, the republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) Monday evening on national television, and they sang alone on the Broadway-Stück, "the Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the return to the Congress.
When they, along with Diane Sawyer in the ABC News "20/20 ," they struggled for words and needed help in walking.
The program showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage that the bullet that divided their durchbohrt skull, the left side of her brain and its head from start to finish, has done.
Three months ago, she returned surprising in the Congress, triumphantly cast their vote on the debt.
In her first television interview after the attack in January in which six people were killed and 13 injured, smiling Gifford, laughed and sang - and described their recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford replied (41): "It is very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an one-hour "20/20" Specials, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book by the couple: "Gabby: a story about courage and hope."
The Special followed Giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see it in the hospital bed, with kahl shaved head and a long scarf on the market.
It can only one or two fingers when her husband encouraged them.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show how they implement simple movements.
A nod to the head.
A Zucken with the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days ago Giffords whispering another word: "toast." you want to see their breakfast.
Videos taken place in the ABC show, show that music played an important role in Giffords" recovery: you can see how the members of Congress, along with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin" "singing."
In the interview with Sawyer said Giffords daily spends two hours with therapy that they do not remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that he Giffords on 12 March had read an article in a newspaper on the attack when they interrupted him and asked for the first time, the six people who were killed during the attack.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and forced medical treatment while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Tough, tough, tough."
In the course of the recovery of his wife, Kelly told Sawyer, she said: "I was hit."
"So, I would say:" Gabby, you got to be unbeaten? ', "said Kelly.
You just got to be taken.
And you will be, and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel more sympathy than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala, the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a Ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
In a word collected themselves hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The crowd in black Smokings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organised the fundraising effort in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, which, among other things, by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen has been observed, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure the organizers have good intentions.
I know that.
But there was no respect, not really. It was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, service members say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if their people in uniform suffering.
"We were not victims," said Brigadier general Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it is the only way of support, to put ourselves in the role of unfortunate souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders, who do not want ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also have recognized that the anger, the returning troops in the last few years of the Vietnam War, was far worse.
As a result there are discussions about compassion in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons have returned from battles with the marines, warned Colonel ex-army Mark Cancian that people outside the military world their service could be seen from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe, as they defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a "angry, violent veteran beneath the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and a senior government posts in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewer erfragten subtle, whether he was the same after his return from the struggle to cope with the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
"If you are talking about your service, you must keep the negative impressions about it," Cancian said his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is rooted in part in the lack of interest in the war.
Services on the battlefield of a country that has little experience with the military and little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, rarely singled out as praise.
"We as a nation, not military heroism, as it was in the Second World War was absolutely normal," said Lieutenant General David Barno, the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public largely due to the suffering of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends who have lost them, or for the severity of their injuries.
The military is growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men for failing to intervene in a rape to be charged before the military court.
If it does not happen, there are hundreds of plaintiffs ready for the next hearing.
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow.
It was in October 2008 and they returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when they met at a male colleague, has a 12 s Pack beer.
He asked them whether they should accompany a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texanerin swept aside their concerns.
I thought: "Oh, he is 19.
He is from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind them, put them down and raped her, she said.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials anxious to a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a complaint against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court.
The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, DC, the complaint was initially comprised 17 plaintiffs, but in the next few months rose to 28:25 women and three men, who all claim that they are soldiers who have been raped or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify, to condemn or to make a proper justice after the alleged attack.
Burke says it has the top military leadership, because the problem is there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has since February nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future claims.
Their strategy: instead that all claimants were laying their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, many more complaints in order to keep up the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to reject a complaint.
The files of the court, Newsweek, the defence strategy, first and foremost, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for violations, in the armed forces.
On the basis of a law by the Supreme Court in 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for violations that soldiers on active service.
"The alleged damage caused during the military service of the plaintiff," the document says.
The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to work in the fight, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers increasingly important roles, particularly in the contact with indigenous women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars killed 150 soldiers, two thirds of them in hostilities.
It is time that the military will be modernised, says Burke.
And it is not alone in their fight: three other complaints their are pending.
At Yale Law School, the veteran "Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four main military academies because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere.
The small independent non-profit Vietnam veteran of America a complaint against the military, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder," which received rape victims to dismiss them from the service - a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December the group filed a complaint against the veteran administration, management of the war veterans), in which their discriminatory practices in its dealings with entitlements for people who have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws has been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties in Congress, which will provide a number of leads.
In 2010, according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, Office for Prevention and reporting sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defence 3,158 sexual abuse.
But most of the abuses are not reported at all, and after the Pentagon's own estimate takes into account the number of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, which was published in March, the prosecution rates: 2010, 20% of the cases in the military court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma.
In Lymans case reported the alleged rape of the military police less than a hour after the attack.
On this night, she says, she was asked 11 times, the details of her rape of a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of their aggressor, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge during the hearing she was asked about the sex they had before the attack with her friend.
Six people said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I still remember the day when the verdict was read out," says Lyman.
"I thought that it would be. I ran screaming from the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric ward and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander: this was not his procedure, and that was my trial."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist, in the end, a diagnostizierte personality disorder and declared them incompetent.
In January 2010, it was sacked dishonourable, so that they have no support.
Whether the complaint, the Lyman and the other claimants have submitted, is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticised for the first time, it has been called into question.
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is a decade later, because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence, which is a liability.
He adds: "The odds are against them... But it is important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their path, Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, with its hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens as the first.
Walls have eyes: how researchers watching you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik, only one of many boys, their anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has been on a killing spree in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, its first public hearing before the court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent much time until his attack before his computer and with some of the millions of gechattet nationalists, the extreme right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But, as we find them?
This is easy - you need only log on Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe.
Were books hiding place of personal data is so enzyklopädisch, Bartlett says that the researchers simply must use the promotional tool of their desired demographic data to determine exactly with scientific accuracy - as do retailers for years.
Bartletts team found half a million supporters of far-right groups throughout Europe and visierte them with Adds, but instead with a new band or to connect a new diet product Adds invited users to a poll in which, according to their level of education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without that they had to leave their office.
"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoters of extreme-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
But in a way surprising meanings are "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
Demos work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health issues to social trends, such as "Likes" text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, on average three content per day, were books generated "data supernova explosion," a research boom, the number of scientific work with the name of this side of the title in the last five years by almost 800% increase.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that you can study this side of people not normally with his Clipboard on the street.
"If you previously tried to consult the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to first inform the party and they would never have access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook is everything away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the side offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full binge on Facebook, are significantly more problem than students who remained silent on this issue.
Moreno suggests that equal students, for example, residential adviser, monitor and help a student if they postet too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you have not recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Autor and head of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found in a different way."
Facebook also zapft the data of its own people.
The data team has statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and a national happiness index (primarily used primarily on the only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have a long time that the side of their large data treasure trove for others available for research purposes.) 
But the users of Facebook know that the side they watched, whether they like it or not. with a friend, thousands of miles away, to be able to play Scrabble, the side's own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook, part of a survey that they do not even know something?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines, such as their offline data collected online, everything is permitted.
"I do not believe that many users have thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge lab, a study from the year 2006, in which he looked side of students on Facebook.
"What they are concerned, it was only about them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims are true in an user profile and in speeches.
"What we say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as technology researchers that a Clipboard and a pencil are still the best research tools, anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for it to go into the real world and to speak with real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social dimension - and plenty of social life is still offline."
"Cold and inhumane ": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Unlike Behring Breivik, the man who has been two amok, which this summer in Norway, 77 people were killed, has himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" to fight.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court, because you have received your mandate of organizations supporting hate ideologies and because it is supported by the multiculturalism."
"I recognise the laws, but I plead not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, because he "Breivik did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to Breivik, a pre-written speech permits at the end of the hearing to go to the families of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik for 12 more weeks in custody, he will be four weeks has no access to the media, he said that the authorities all visits and all correspondence about eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted the confirmation that he remains behind bars.
All took part with the aim that everything on a Wegschließen.
"I thought he is cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it is a bit further, after I have seen and heard the suspects."
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and worked throughout the hearing calmly and professionally. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breiviks bizarre reference, he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may be some that the attacks of 22 July, apparently the work of an individual extremists and not a group of radicals.
But that automatically the sadness and confusion, of a whole nation still?
"I wish he would look like a monster, but he does not do this," said the relatives of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of interviews with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5. some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed the engineering genius as a great modern inventors.
What Apple fans, but perhaps the most telling in the recently discovered jobs interview, which this week dusted off special film displays on the major markets, is how this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed Hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer, the zealous Diagrams bastelte - a man who believed that many business leaders suffer from "a disease of thought ,"" a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product. "
In 1995, Bob Cringely the TV series "triumph of the specialist idiots" on the departure of the personal computer, and he sat for more than a hour with jobs, in a rare, detailed discussions.
At this stage than 10 years since Jobs have been forced out of Apple, and he has worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringleys interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery.
Only after jobs death we discovered a complete VHS copy in the garage of the director.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68minütigen film "Steve Jobs: the lost interview," this Wednesday and Thursday in the Mark theatre.
For someone who is known for his extensive interviews, jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, it is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds, in which jobs clearly his thoughts and accuracy.
There are also moments in which Jobs" perfect day comes when he seemingly impatient to Cringelys issues and anschubst, faster on issues or actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone included the lost interview somehow seems eerily prescient when jobs evaluated what other companies in his opinion is right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing, posthumous awards for career jobs, but jobs are to be seen as the eager dreamers on the leap to the grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should.
Shortly after he had said that everything, he set off and made it.
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of Verlorenen interviews:
As he learned to run a business:
"During the years I always ask:" Why are you doing things? "and the answer you get is," Oh, it is made easy. "
No one knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business really carefully about things.
I have noticed that.
Jobs will continue its efforts to streamline the accounting for Apple.
Amazed costs were recorded - usually began with "standard costs ," which were estimated at a mere suspicion and then adapted with" deviation "- he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the business costs in minute.
As the Pope was veralbert:
Jobs told of the "Blue Box ," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which to creep into the telephone company and long-distance calls in vain.
The device has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a telephone to make a phone call and then from an AT & T network in another, while so many satellites as possible.
"We sent half a dozen times around the globe, and if you grölte into the telephone, there was a minute later in the telephone next door," kichernd told jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something that trillions of dollars of infrastructure can control throughout the world."
Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this small thing that can control a gigantic thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would be without Apple.
Jobs have been told from a glorious stroke, Wozniak and he almost pulled out when they are in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican, and wanted to talk with the Pope, while they are so good they were Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night were called in to speak with the American diplomat, the two loslachen before the Pope himself came to the telephone.
As he is in the technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett):
In the age of 12 years ago, when he looked for spare parts to build a radio meters, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called on him.
Shortly after her 20 minutes telephone call received jobs for the summer a Hewlett-Packard Teilzeitjob.
"This has had a remarkable influence on me. it was the only company that I had seen in the age, and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its staff."
Later jobs was one of the HP workers visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he was "the first desktop computers ever produced."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braun tube and I fell in love with him.
I would like to HP as a teenager climb and hang on to this machine and programmes to write for them.
How innovation improves:
Several times in the interview speaks about how we invent new products.
Early in his career, when he einbaute some platinum, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to both the assembly processes and the extradition of the finished equipment.
Later, when Apple reminds him of the problems in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember resounding arguments... You shouted at me, that it would take five years to build a mouse, which would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse, which we are building for $15. it was incredibly credible.
On large companies.
Long before he saw Apple revived, jobs are the ways in which so many industrial giants came with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"We say that you are working with IBM or Xerox, so you make a better photocopying or printer, well?"
They have the monopoly on stock, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it successful, in other words, there are such people, which ultimately lead the companies and the product, in which people are being squeezed out of the decision-making process.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly enjoyed by the people who have no concept about good products versus bad products, eradicated - craft art.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox would have been able to have the entire computer industry.
It could be ten times greater, the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They have caught the defeat from victory.
On innovation as an art form:
"It is a lot of craft art between a great idea and a great product... If you develop this great idea, they change and grow."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
We must make votes, certain things that you can do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
We must note 5000 cases, these concepts, and they all bring together....
Ultimately, it comes down to the taste, it is to that an attempt is being made, with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to get these things together, which makes it possible.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly in stealing grand ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historians, who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
It would not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health care legislation, as a court accepts case
On the day of the Supreme court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the political dividing question whether it is a challenge to the health care legislation will hear from President Obama, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, at a dinner, which was gesponsort by the law firm that represented the case before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases was a complaint, the 26 states against the far-reaching reform of the health care system, which were adopted last year by Congress, a law that the conservative activists across the United states on the slogan.
The judges agreed with the hearing; in fact, a 5 1/2 - hour basic discussion is expected in March, the result will probably boost the presidential campaign in 2012, at the time, the court decision will be in full swing.
The lawyer, who stand trial and will claim that the law is to overturn, Paul Clement will probably be, once attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements services, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist society, a group devoted to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company, which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the Business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is a huge part in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had been on the case in a Washington hotel.
Service, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the group of Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health-care reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges attend meetings of the federalist society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges freed from the code of conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the code, which states: "a judge can participate in benefiz events because local and other organizations, with the judge is not a spokesperson, the guest or a host of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas to two of the case related firms, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this in order to alert Moral-und-Regierungsaktivisten.
"This startling break with morality and contrary to the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court is the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with cases pending at the court."
Their appearance and their support of a fundraising effort for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say that they would issue judicial easily with groups who are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist society.
And Thomas" wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
By contrast, the Conservatives claim that it was Judge Elena Kagan, who have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was general prosecutor under the Obama administration, when the first legal challenges in the first instance in court.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias, because they are too much involved in the defence of the law, in order to be impartial.
Kagan is not about to do so.
Boeing has a record of 18 trillion in country
Airline Emirates ordered 50 two-track aircraft from the Boeing 777 with an option for 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 trillion dollars.
It is really a rare news that a company gets about 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big business, if the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft, with a record of 18 trillion dollars.
It is also unusual for the charge of Boeing, the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast, which was published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East over the next 20 years, 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion.
Boeing announced at the weekend, its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-track Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer was commissioned by the airline Emirates Dubai.
The airline has also announced Boeing 2011 at the Dubai air show, an option to buy 20 more planes, the entire list price to $26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, then ordered, according to Boeing, Oman Air six Boeing 787 - 8, the so-called Dreamliner, fuel consumption and vastly improved passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than 1 trillion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stock market expert from Morningstar.
"The quality of this particular customer is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are in possession of the oil producing countries.
Not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, There is a rise in oil prices, which usually is detrimental to the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost items, not so harmful, because the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important, because they are less than other airlines tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders, when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"You have a natural hedge," he said.
The appointment of Sultanate reinforces Boeing's leading position in the market for large aircraft and helps the Airbus competitor SAS to keep in the supremacy of the A350.
Boeing's victory on the air show comes four months after Airbus has announced that it would postpone the introduction of the biggest A350, which competes directly with the 777 - 300ER.
It postponed the introduction, in order to gain more confidence, after the customers asked for a higher burden and scope.
Boeing shares rose by 1,5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican president apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug traffickers opponents Fausto Vallejo of the PRI have supported in the race for the governorships.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently lost their bid for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. They claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, the race for the governorships in the western state.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire electoral processes and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls... You have polling booths, road blockades built... And people are to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico, until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are looking for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo Claderon seems barely to have led in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo as victors.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, the PRD, which is still acting governor, came to three, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Also Aureoles refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital city of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers, and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels, which specializes in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has Michoacan chosen in December 2006 to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers.
The violence still continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election, during an election rally for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates have dropped out of fear for the local elections.
For the PRI a victory party, no matter how repugnant the elections appear in Michoacan.
The man, the PRI in the presidential race is likely to be represented, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated the Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think that this victory gives us look into the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help in the rescue of the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro zone in its heavy debt crisis, in order to prevent a long-term downward trend, which will slow down the growth of the economy in Asia.
Rajat Nag, administrative director of the ADB headquarters in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world "must do" everything in your power to the recovery of the currency bloc, either by the International Monetary Fund to speed up or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), the "dispassionately" look at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of the European leadership and European resources through Asia to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We are all in the same boat."
"So everyone is helpful, which can help Europe out of this crisis," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union was in the past few months in a severe debt crisis.
In the last few days, Italy rose dangerously interest costs, and the Prime Minister, both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The heavy debt crisis in Europe is fuelling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls, the leading emerging countries must unite to support the euro zone.
Mr Nag said that any support in Asia will be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - the European partners in Asia, greater bargaining power.
Anand Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the euro zone, as the domestic economy is suffering from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants to see that the euro zone remains unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing great challenges and we need to maintain a high growth level."
"It is not an option, it is a task, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans, even if they are facing major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at American Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India, aid for Europe, of which more than 800 million of $2 or less a day.
"At some point they will find that the Greeks with 50 retire and holidays are on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, executive director of the World Economic Forum, asked why India's reserves should be used in Greece, the numerous and well paid employees to keep in the public sector, with jobs in bad geleitetet losses einbringe nden institutions such as the railways.
Mr. Nag said that the crises in the euro zone "significant knock-on effects" on the whole of Asia.
The ADB forecast an economic growth at 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011 / now threatens "the risk of escalation," because of the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must "contingency plans" to prepare themselves for a downward trend and a significant outflow of capital Wortschaften.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in the defence
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, so he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the chessboards in Afghanistan and civilian conveyor belts.
The Pentagon already rethinking cuts of $450 trillion dollars over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts 600 trillion or more will be needed if the Congress can reach a conclusion in the spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% across-the-board cuts, as well as a halt numerous new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a way that would make most of our shipping and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously harm," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would be forced to separate us involuntarily from a large part of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented quickly, we would have almost certainly kinds of civilians, in order to be able to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage."
The cuts were in the end, the combat troops, "said Panetta.
"During the war time quotas in the fight against terror are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference would adversely affect the war effort in the budget," Panetta warned.
"Recruitment has been cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision, support the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be cut, which leads to late payments to dealers and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of defence.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would be a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power in the world."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when she Panettas letter published.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose."
"The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United States and their commitment should not be allowed."
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will strengthen demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, although he has many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House, before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces difficult choices.
At a press conference in the last week, the defence minister, painting a gloomy picture, which could face a military shell, but without a core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without ammunition."
"It is an air Force squadrons without sufficient trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers who are able to fulfil the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force, there is a lack of morality and alert, and is not in a position to compete with potential opponents."
"You can be angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global commitment and response capacity, which leads to an unacceptable risk in future military operations."
And Panetta said that some of the removal of the largest defense projects could fall victim, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.
This list also includes Fighter planes F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new aircraft bombs, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new litt oral combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
We would stop the further development and testing of the F35, it would in the next 10 years to save up to 80 trillion dollars, but supporters say that it can be an important next step in the buildup, so that the possible dangers posed by China and other opponents.
As a lie unmasks
A glance at the current headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lies in daily life.
The Republican presidential nominee for president, Herman Cain, is dealing with the allegations of sexual harassment on the part of several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
The leadership of Penh State is accused of the President's, since it has allegedly withheld reports, according to which a retired football coach boy sexually abused.
In the past week has been mitangehört on an open microphone, as the French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the American President Barack Obama, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York congressman and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner was kidding when he brought renunciations in circulation, which were quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in the campaign financing in connection with the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one forgets that it has seen the media circus, President Bill Clinton has triggered when he during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky lied.
Stories about Schummeln at school and college tests are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers their students test answers, so that they themselves well in their performance reviews.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and Schummeln.
How much deception we see?
As studies show that we are lying every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, but as Notlügen.
Another study shows that strangers to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Lies, or "lies" is one that is important for every human being, and that both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game such as, for example, in which it is the goal, "you!" is the Enttarnen of a deception, a serious knowledge based on scientific data over the past six decades have been collected at prestigious universities, which had carried out extensive research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
As a result of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies were revealed.
Look lies in the eye.
They stammeln falters, blush and zappeln not always.
As a result, we can not conclude that these liars difficult to identify and treat.
An experienced Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth, something about the structure of the opinion that the subtle facial expressions, and timing.
I have spent several years, the scientific findings of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of the in exposing, and it is clear that the Enttarnen of a deception is a modern ability, which is easy to learn and help us find in our complex world, especially if the closing or the questioning of people or negotiations or administration belong to their own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good to other people to raise their interest and to control their own emotions. And they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we know that extrovertierte people are more often than introvertierte people that men are more than women, "lies" selbstorientierte whose lies more "other" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people anlügen their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies ").
We also know that if a person has been exposed as a culprit, others feel less guilty, this person to have lied.
As you can tell whether someone is lying?
First, by watching the normal behaviour of this person.
This is called "Baselining," the starting position.
It is a point of reference for the subsequent assessment of changes.
A the attitude, the laughter, the quality of their participants.
They should know better, when someone is normally standing trippelt with the foot, so that they do not unfairly when he trippelt during a meeting with the foot.
Then you look at accumulations more startling verbal and nonverbaler behaviour.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells ring, not as proof of an exposing.
People who are, perhaps, if they try to remember their history, and perhaps their feet in the door or they are in the outcome, change their position on significant way or show a "relaxation after the recruitment interview," this deep, entspannende Ausatmen and the change in attitude, if all the hard questions are over.
Interrogator often mistakenly signal that a recruitment conversation is over, only after this detente after the recruitment interview.
You also pay attention to the language of your participants.
The slip-up by Scott Peterson is famous, when he used the past tense, when he claimed that his wife was still on life and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a distance language: "I have not had a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you have a tricky question repeated in its entirety.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when it is a vexed question: ..." in order to tell you the truth... As far as I know... In good faith. "
This is the answer wahrnehmend rather than factual, which often the alarm bells.
There is no magic remedy for Enttarnen of lies, but they can learn skills, thanks to an exposing is possible.
Thanks to these skills can be the victims of fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline will be reviewed after exposure to delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to in the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions and environmentalists, is that the pipeline would provide companies trying to plan the project, so that we can return to normal.
Canada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of Sand Hills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building in Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of, said that the company was still confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the last week, after which a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course would be reviewed, the area of sand Hills in Nebraska, as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a large water supply, meide.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the State Department has ordered, may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections in the coming year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision is a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said his support.
The 1700 mile pipeline, linking Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators Nebraskas, who oppose the plan, weighing up the laws, a departure from the region of sand Hills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation, to force.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the principal investigator of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist, the by Canada, Paul Elliott, who was 2008 adviser of Hillary Clinton, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company, which has been allocated to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, as it is with Canada.
Patti LaBelle indicted because they allegedly forced a toddler from fear to erbrechen
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of their Manhattaner building, a Tobsuchtanfall, their small daughter in fear that they fear.
The tirade of "Lady Marmalade" singer was 18 months old Genevieve Monk suffers such fear that they "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of foreigners," said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year, when the stagehands Kevin Monk, his wife, Anna, a kindergarten teacher, and on a family outing Genevieve wanted to leave.
While Kevin Monk, the car, Rose Anna Monk with baggage and Genevieve on the arm in the lobby in her building on the River Side Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said that she had stopped near the door and dropped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone was behind me and said:" you know what your daughter is doing? "I said," yes', and in order to take them back on the arm, "she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone:" You should not sell your daughter in the vicinity of the door, "said Rose Anna Monk.
"I said to her:" I am not interested in what you say or think. "
She was angry and began to shout - she used the F word and the word and was very loud....
She had a bottle of water in the hand and began to dump water from the bottle.
She said Genevieve would become hysterical.
"I said to this woman:" you see what you have done with my daughter, "said the mother of the child.
LaBelle crashed on the mother, who still Genevieve was on the arm, and her companion had withheld and be drawn into a waiting car, said Rose Anna Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to, she said.
Later, the family asked LaBelle in writing for an apology, but received no response.
LaBelles lawyer and representatives did not respond to phone calls in which was asked for an opinion.
The complaint is not going to some compensation, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he would not be a fee, and the family plan, the money they get, the children's cancer aid donations.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for their behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially if it is a kindergarten teacher, a 18 - month-old baby on the arm."
Climatic adversity blocking the economy
In the first year in which Mario Lopez took part in the government, unemployment rose in Sinaloa and the black economy, while the foreign investment and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, the in economic history Sinaloas remembered, and it is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of change and fueled great hopes on the economic growth, the government is, however, as a result of the climatic adversity can be growth, but on the contrary, deteriorated the most important economic indicators.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions of dollars in agriculture, but also the growth of the state economy close borders and caused in the first quarter of a general decline in economic activity by 3.6% this is mainly on the historic dismantling of agricultural development at 31.16 percent, allowing other sectors of the economy.
According to a by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (. Mexican Council for sustainable agricultural development) report on the impact of the frost, there were 582 000 hectares of arable land damaged, of which 78.03 percent and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed, all of the vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity until November, in the Mexican state unemployment to rise steadily, and the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed in the first quarter of a rapid rise in unemployment, from January to March had 55 053 Sinaloas inhabitants no employment, which is 4,53 percent of the working population. The unemployment rate to 5.28 percent in the second quarter, from July to September to 6,19 percent, which is about 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa. These are more than 18 969 people in the first quarter of the year.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year to several factors: the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the School of Economic and Social Sciences at the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented on the policy of public institutions indirectly declare growing unemployment.
"What we are seeing now is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with the loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts by the legislation, which was adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who accumulate stashed dollars, it is not easy for them to work, to invest or otherwise use anything," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people in the country to look for work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen. This is due to the entry of problems and, on the other hand, on the one hand, because it is difficult to find work, and these people remain here and looking for work, unemployment rise," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work. This includes, according to INEGI 60.38 percent of the country's employees, who work without paying into the coffers of the social security system.
With regard to unemployment and undeclared low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (governmental authority for work and Social welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa until September 5352 pesos; that is very much less than the national average, which stands at 7375 pesos.
Decline in FDI

The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (governmental authority for economic development), for its part, recorded a total investment of EUR 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, the company mainly comes from the tertiary sector.
The debt
In the face of the economic crisis, the provincial government in July at the National Congress, a loan of 3000000000 pesos, the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects should be invested in the 18 communities. The National Congress approved an amount of EUR 200,600,000 pesos, but until November no positive effects of the debt on some of the economic sectors in the country.
Reactions
For the representatives of the people, the first year of government, Mario López Valdés government incompetence.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (state chamber of manufacturing in Mexico), argued that in 2011 no efforts to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the federal government, have been made.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor in this year, and it needs to be worked hard to regain lost ground in this year and 2012 we must exert twice. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already government teams have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year, the country's economic development and growth slowed.
"The economic flow is the result of a number of events, including the Frosts. One of the most important impact is a slowing economy, which is not enough to an economic dynamism, which generate a reasonable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will finish the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexico) employers" association in Sinaloa said the state should be more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have seen that work has been done, and we believe that it is necessary for a long-term programme to redefine the economic appeal and to develop the country, because it is important that all the material and human resources to activate Sinaloas," he said.
There is much to be done
The chairman of Coparmex stressed how important it is to develop a vision of the future, which draws the efforts of the government in a better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, but the economic development has come forward, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current government is making progress in the government.
"There are areas in which we can say that the government has acted more fully. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is a lot of work lies ahead of it," he said.
Arrest on 8 kg of marijuana
In addition to five years in prison and 100 daily records, a resident of Navolato sentenced for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The prosecutor of the Republic announced that the small drug traffickers was Omar Alexis Valenzuela sand Oval, for a crime against public health - to trade certain possession of marijuana - was punished.
According to the Act AP / SIN / CLN / 687/2010 / M-I Valenzuela was Valenzuela sand Oval on the 7th Junio 2010 by Mexican soldiers in monitoring the street Cipriano Valdez to the No 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato, were arrested.

Debt for construction work
In the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 Sozialbaus for migrants who are at risk because of a lack of resources not to be completed, or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the municipal authority for social development, said that, although the building are already at an advanced stage, they are now in danger, because the government allotted funds for the three programmes 11 million peso has not paid.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes almost 50 million peso, which fell 25 percent of the state, but until now, only the Federación and community funds contributed to the work, which is why a delay in the Baubeendigung was to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year end, they have given us a penny, even though they are already in July would have to pay a part of," he said. "in order not to be too late, we have already begun with the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state has not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the community at the beginning of the government a loan of 7 million needed to borrow would be equivalent to the amount that the central government would have to pay.
"That was already in the last parliamentary term, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes went further and this year we have had to raise the funds, which had not raised by the state to participate in these programmes," he said.
Even if the state authorities are obliged to the disbursement of these funds, he commented that the minister for administration and finance, has been asked to speed up the administrative work and pay the outstanding amount as quickly as possible.
"They must contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year comes to an end, they have given us a penny."
The court approved for 2015, the transition to digital television in Mexico
The switchover from analogue to digital signals in the world in recent years, the most important changes.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN), the constitutional claims, which the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies were lodged against the presidential decree, and the switch from analogue to digital signals must be brought forward from 2021 to 2015, due to a lack of eight votes are needed for the legal challenge.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that the President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his powers when he decree-law with the details of the switch to the terrestrial digital television.
With this decision was rejected by the Senate's constitutional dispute, because he did not have the necessary qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide the constitutionality or the constitutionality. So the law remains in force.
In the project for the complaint, which the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero has been proposed to explain the decree law unconstitutional because, for the radio and television regulations affecting the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale telecommunications Commission in Mexico) is responsible, which is why the decree-law hierarchical principles and the law would contradict.
In favour of the project, only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies constitutional complaints against the decree-law. After the adoption of the complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero decree-law no longer and all activities to create the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, for which the Minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister, not to agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the national government is not with the general provisions of the measures, which should take the public administration must regulate.
"I do not believe that, if we were to do, that would undermine the independence of the regulator." you recalled that the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, the central state government is responsible for constitutional reasons, because it is the state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it leads to a better use of the elektrischen spectrum, a higher quality of the signal and more channels.
The delay in the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the gain of digitisation, which is a decision in the public interest, not just a technical point of view, "because they include economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she said, "the action of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic management by the state had a group of characteristics, which the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She called that many countries around the world, the digital conversion have already carried out, and the government, even though they have highly specialised facilities.
It could not conclude that the government with the publication of the contested law decree in the powers of the Congress, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected, "he said.

On Wednesday, the new Italian government
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the president of Italy, to present the new government, the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic collapse.
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the president of Italy, to present the new government, the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that on Sunday appointed Monti would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, in order to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet by the majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take up his office.
Monti said he would give the president the results of the talks with the political parties to form a government.
"I would like to express my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former European Commissioner journalists.
Monti confirmed not explicitly the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.
The "framework is now well established," he added.
Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than normal, Meanwhile, Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis, the cost of debt in an intolerable level.
The new government led by the former European Commissioner Monti should adopt a tough austerity package, which was requested by the euro politicians to regain the shattered trust in Italy.
The pressure to rush to Monti, reinforced by the volatile market situation, as a result of the Italian government bonds for 10 years, with 7% interest. This is in line with the state, in which Greece and Ireland have been forced to apply for the European rescue package.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "we said we would support this government on all sides."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy from this emergency situation.
The chances of success Monti's have increased by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of professor Monti are destined to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential, because until now, many of its members against a majority of technocrats government, particularly the.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Opposition to his efforts, or the delay of the reforms could lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of foreign banks, with his suggestion that a failure was a disaster, also pressure.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and employers" associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday evening, the session is to be completed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, as a response to the crisis an extremely rapid change of government has set in motion.
After a sigh of relief at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, due to the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister, the cost of the Italian government bonds reached critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 trillion, would be too much for the current EU rescue package.
Monti said that his government had until the next elections, which is expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that the politicians will give him time to implement the reforms, instead of the elections.
Monti said he would like to see politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only be made up of technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties, the inclusion of people from political life.

The quintet was Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate his years of existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream come true."
In an exclusive interview with Viva says the Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, the band is prepared for the next Sunday in the national stadium to give one of their best concerts.
More than 20 years they have been expected, but the band assured that it is a dream come true, if they play in Costa Rica.
The the Bassist and Mitgründer group, Jeff Ament, the Viva last week by Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20 years of existence, and on Sunday, 20, they make their only freeze in Central America.
On this day, they come from 7.30 pm in the national stadium, along with the band the X from Los Angeles and Las robe rtas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript to be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans realised a dream when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
To play in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us.
This is just the second time that we in South and Central America, and until now, it has been great.
I am only on holiday in Costa Rica. It is a beautiful country, that we will stay a few days ago.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this, because the fans of the band are completely; you can see the days before the concert closest possible.
What does it to your enthusiastic fans?
Thank you, all these years on our side.
We have spent nearly 21 years until we came to Costa Rica, and we are very sorry to have waited so long to have taken so long, until we came here.
Some people are even of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
This is not a little bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows that we have made in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We have played a few giant shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we are prepared for this concert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we have to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle for Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did your Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friend are, and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are unimaginable.
My friends are always surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico are excellent places for surfing. In this way, people who love the surfing, we have learned from it.
With a view of the travel giant shows with many songs.
What plans you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played, we have no borders.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs, and we want to play a couple of songs from each album and our fans a good and varied repertoire.
It is never repeated your repertoire.
Why?
I think that this is partly because we have nine plates and more than 120 songs can play everyone likes a different song, so that the decision, which we will play against each other, is not easy.
If we have two or three songs, which we have no longer have played into the repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us, because they are the reasons why we have taken this Song's. They might otherwise be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, for the audience.
With this tour celebrates its twenty years of history.
If you look back, it is hard to believe in your success?
Yes, totally.
First of all, I believe that none of us has presented to play once in a great rock band, and more than 20 years, and it looks like a dream.
We continue on this blessing, and it is great to be able to make music together.
We love, and we are thrilled to bring music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world, which we have always wanted to visit again.
Things could not be better.
What does it mean for you, actively participated in the birth of the Grunge?
It has always been a honour to belong to this group of large bands.
We are good with the people of Sound Guards, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and very unusual, if a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band from a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups at the same time, come from the same city.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound garden on their tour. We are pleased to be friendly with them all and honoured to be part of this past Seattle Sound.
It is also very unusual for a band like yours so long ago, together with the same musicians.
Yes, four of us play for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago, and that It is a lot more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive and we also care about each other.
We are all close friend why musical paths have opened each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. It could not be better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, on the other hand, it was thanks to your success always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown, it has made it easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music.
As long as we keep in mind that people have come because of the music reminds you that you have the music and what they created, must be careful not to be a famous rock star, and that has never interested.
What memories you have in your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we have very good songs, and at the beginning, it was great.
We were three years for a band until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never had a record.
We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore TD), with the band, a friend, when I hear a song or see photos, I think, what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought me, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and music and football, and many other issues.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic bond Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that she knows her work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that is why you have chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos by various groups and the band did best, and that is why we are curious to see what robe rtas live can offer live. This is exciting.
Why does the text of Yellow Ledbetter, if you play live?
This is an issue for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he thinks.
Who you got to be affected as Bassist?
So many +
Among the first to me, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I have the whole afternoon on the bassists, which I could talk about.
As Pearl jazz Jam has managed to keep the Grunge alive, although it is no longer a fad?
I think we all feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the band, which I mentioned earlier, for example, Mudhoney Sound Guards, nirvana and all the others that were at the same time, if they are still important today, I think it is great, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and bands such as Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
Initially, their music was dark, it is now more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I believe there are a few tunes created on the new album, which might seem somewhat lightly. But there are also other songs such as the End or just Breathe, which are classified as very dark Song's, even though they also have something positive.
Both, I had the tears when I heard how Ed played, and it is very dark Song's.
I believe that if you are older and something drastic happened in your life - for example, if a family member or a friend loses - influenced your artistic creation and your music, and these two songs embody the clear for me.
But I am also of the opinion that we have to be a happy man and can still make dark music.

Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of Congress, and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori investigated in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas for three days, in order to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned on humanitarian grounds, yet he does not want this, because he is innocent.
He was four times to cancer of the tongue, and he has lost 18 kilos weight. Other diseases, such as a severe erosive Gastritis, a Zyste in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and Durchblutungsprobleme in the legs, was one of the doctor.
Fujimori has since September 2007 in the penitentiary Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian army death squad during his government, was convicted.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by the Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneur launches on Tuesday their visit to Mexico to expand the trade between the two countries and to discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica meets next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, according to the Uruguayan president of the height of his ausgebuchten timetable with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayer living in Mexico.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, "for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the president of the South American country announced on his website.
According to local media Mujica support Calderón's regarding the incident with France, the French leader Nicolas Sarkozy at the summit of the G20 in the French city of Cannes, the South American country on a list of tax havens.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to ensure that those countries which still act as tax havens, from the international community, and this statement was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a question during his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has since November, the Presidency of the G20, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world. Since January this year, there is an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid the duplication in excess of the South American country.
The government of Uruguay has tried in recent years to speed up the creation of agreement on the exchange of tax information from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic cooperation and Development (OECD) to be, and We are countries that are not all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay on commercial level since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The schnurrbärtige plumber is breaking with "Super Mario 3D country," the third dimension
Super Mario has worked tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but until now never in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D country," he fights for the love of the girls in Stereo technology.
The game, which this month on the Ladentheken all over the world, played from the beginning of the characteristics of the portable console Nintende 3DS, without special glasses three-dimensional can be played.
"Mario is the figure who must say how the Stereoskopie works without glasses," assured Omar Alvarez, who is responsible for the Nintendo press specialising in Spain during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said, "Super Mario 3D country" was "the first video game from Nintendo, which from the outset has been developed for this console ," because until now have been successful articles such as" Star Fox 64 3D "or" Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D "adaptations of existing titles.
The spokesman for Nintendo stressed that, even though it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D country" is a "affordable" video game, which will permit a quick, liquid game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D" two games in one: the first part is "easy" to the less geschckten users.
Then the experts on the various levels, which are becoming more and more difficult, a "second round."
It also allows users in real time between a "aggressive D" or one that only the depth of the action. In order to overcome the obstacles, without the victims of the "optical effects," however, must always be played three-dimensional.
This excursion Super Marios into three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which is no longer the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo zwinkert fans of the saga, and repeated the recipe for success of the last spending: the schnurrbärtige plumber must overcome with dangers peppered platforms in order to liberate the Princess Peach.
However, the players on news of the movements, the environment, the guises and enemies - and a "spielbaren" Luigi.
Colom guarantees for the Portillos extradition to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would be the extradition of the former governor, Alfonso Portillo, so that in the United States for conspiracy to money laundering $70 million.
The process ends on the request of the United States to extradite Portillo, so that it can be brought to justice.
In a press conference, Colom, confirmed its decision based on the independence of judiciary and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had ordered the extradition.
He stressed that he and his government had not interfered in court decisions and all extradition requests, of which he was.
But Portillo be Sergio Ruano Marroquín for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The action Coloms is an act of government, which will take place, if all legal and constitutional bodies on the sentencing of the former Staaatspräsidenten (2000 -2004).
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala must be extradited Portillo if his legal situation is resolved in Guatemale and guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales in the Department of Defense during his ruling period. This negotiation with the extradition, but the minister, contradiction and revived the case anew.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion helped
The organization was created to prevent the marginalisation of young people without professional training.
The first 25 years of social welfare organisation Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter of a century, 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion supports, in order to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over 100 jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary was yesterday at an event in the former station buildings Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people took stock.
Trinijove was 1986 in the neighbourhoods Trinitat Vella with the aim to provide young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems, which were threatened by the risk of margins to help.
At yesterday's ceremony in Sant Andreu many leaders of agencies and institutions who have worked in those 25 years with the club.
The participation of political representatives from different directions to election campaigns, the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the president of the Generalitat (parliament of the autonomous region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of the former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current left-green councillor Ricard Goma.
The great hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalonian minister for social affairs and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the social network of savings bank La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Ma stressed that Trinijove was created, and that the current times are no less complicated in very difficult times, but he added that the work he has done until now is a good basis. "
For the president of the Generalitat Trinijove is a model to fight against difficult circumstances and people are in trouble.
"The economic crisis is for the club and the work he is doing nothing new," he said.
Occupied house, in which big parties were held, was cleared
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve House occupants left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbours of the House Balmes No 51 on the road to an end.
Twelve people left out yesterday lunchtime voluntarily the building, which they illegally occupied and in which they organised huge festivals, the neighborhood had driven to despair. The evacuation was carried out on a court order without police intervention.
After the evacuation was replaced the door has, in order to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on will be controlled access," confirmed the house.
The besetzer house, 11 of the 13 homes had occupied the building - the rest were inhabited - the entire electrical system and part of the water supply, and they had angemalt the walls and all kinds of garbage cans, especially with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors were celebrated huge parties, which lasted up to two days, and the tenants to despair.
In addition to the building, a disco, Balmes 51, which also damage.
Your holder Maria Pantinat Europe Press declared that their business since the beginning of the house occupation would have fallen by 80%.
The owner of the disco pointed out that the besetzer made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while those in the disco cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the Freizeitlokals displayed by the neighbours because of disorder, while they said the noise was not derived from the visitors of the disco, but by the Hausbesetzern and, in particular the guests of the festivities, which were organised, and according to the angry neighbours in the last few weeks, more and more and longer.
The leaders of the disco, said that the harassment was so great that it came with the owner of the building, to pay for the last nine months no rent.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that in the last few weeks have received more complaints from the neighbours.
The leader of the PP (Partido Popular (People's Party) in the city Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had demanded last week to evacuate the building immediately, and the problems of civil coexistence, as well as the reduction of the to get to grips with.
He said that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but that the besetzer house in the last few months in all the floors of the building and almost all homes. In some, it was even to thieves.
In this sense, he added, that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and combat anti-social behaviour in the building."
Yesterday there was another building in the city quarter Nou Barris by the Catalan police.
At 15,30 pm on the street, the police approached Montral No 35, after they had received a call from a neighbour, who had watched as four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects are apart from the disputes over the fees with the tender.
The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the middle of the 1980s, at the height of the now vanished Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the administration published its Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It has even been compared in figures with the Central Park in New York.
With the sinking of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many back to the ceiling of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who does not spreading in the south direction, but upwards (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification Collserolas as a natural park is playing with this idea.
As a model is now no longer the Central Park, but Yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs.
So far, it was when the city in September, a giant, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates after Collserola.
No doubt a gateway refers to the concept of a park.
Either that, or someone has to make gates in the country.
The question is: Collserola, parking or mountain?
The tender is not only from the organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a rekurrentes issue on which two members of the old eingesessenen caste, who meet in the lift.
And it is precisely this fact provides the for one of the rare similarities between the three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary," after the attack on the coast on the "front of the mountains," as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, green apples, has not been resolved.
"It should be based on the principle that is Barcelona's biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "the architect, for which the title" gates of Collserola lexikalische "" lexikalische trap ": it must not "as access to a park, but as a containment of areas where action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" that "the number of risks."
Dangers arising from the "uncertainty, the creation of a public space today" after the experience of the 1980s, which in the area of the forum "swan song."
The first fear is his own limits on what can be developed.
"Something always means to determine the next step," i. e. to exceed it.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [references to the plan, General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, in the direction of Valle sana, "can be understood as a park, not at Barcelona ," for purely topographical reasons.
Modol reminds us that there is already a study from the Patronat de Collserola, which is not "fallen on deaf ears," even though the city council is grateful that his body has given the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very first moment."
He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, even though he his "doubts" whether this technical profile created multidisciplinary teams (" exactly the right thing, "he says)," we architects should only be a tool. "
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex, because in the tender conditions a global view of Collserola: "there have been advertised 16 contests in the sample," he says, "on the axis mountain sea. but there is no Längsschnittperspektive, which considers the territory in its entirety."
This has, at least in his case that he is taking part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors clash.
In his opinion, the city should guarantee that the strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length is a soft transition between city and green zones.
Casino Jonás Larrazábal, who is free
After 72 days of silence liberated the trustees of the casino Red the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the trial against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days in captivity, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the plenipotentiary of the casino Red him before the second criminal court of the district, the trial of the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for blackmail.
After the attack on the casino Royale Sergio Gil Garcia, the owner of the casino Red, a series of photographs and videos, which Manuel Jonás is to see him allegedly forced to pay a sum of money, so that the city Council approved the secret operation of the house.
According to the complaint, the public prosecutor's office opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panistischen mayor, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the officials of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales he was in the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital city.
At this point, he was 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público rejected the offences of corruption and organised crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the detention centre of Cadereyta, because he allegedly bribed the owners of the casino Red with one and a half million pesos had, however, he remained only a few hours in the central security as death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to attend the trial as an inmate of urban prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October, he was the secretary of the Second criminal court of the district, Jorge Yánez, sent to a prison regulation. This found that after almost two months of investigations sufficient evidence to to Jonás guilty for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the house, to be able to open this in return.
This Monday asked the trustees of the casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez judge José Luis Pecina, the brother of the mayor to cancel the penalty, which is why he will be in the next few hours.
During the court hearing asked Ramiro Arias, the official of the court Ministerio Público, García Gómez, whether it was repaired the damage and the owner of the Wetthauses his forgiveness. The lawyer, the name, however.
According to the lawsuit 197/2011 Jonás Larrazábal will be discussed freely, even in the following no objections can be lodged against the process, no compensation is also required.
After the hearing of the agent of the House against 3.50pm Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the urban prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he had been acquitted, and his case to the file.
He also informed him about the judicial order for immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Perez Jácome gives details about the accident, in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake and seven other people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (secretariat for communications and transport in Mexico) informed that the findings on the accident, in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake district of Mora and a further seven people were killed, pointing out that the helicopter with his whole intact structure directly on the ground, without the pilot could have been able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, said Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communications and transportation, that the pilot had confirmed before the start, the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the Propellerflügel in 25 metres contact with trees, while the helicopter lost the hull seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also said that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he met all the conditions for the transportation of personnel.
In addition, he said that during the investigations in the area where the plane was decrepit, no helicopter parts were found.
"No aircraft parts were found in other places, the surcharge was the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a Schrägung from 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but it could be several months, perhaps even a year.
For its part, assured Gilberto López Meyer, Director general of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for aircraft and emergency services in Mexico) that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial flown the surcharge with Reisefluggeschwindigkeit and the plane had fallen to a soft Abhang.
"This information strengthens the assumption that at the time of the impact was a normal flight operation."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, six relevant points, which should be taken into account in the investigation.
Visual flight:
In accordance with the standards, it was a flight to the rules of flight, which means that the team during the flight and on the ground have had sufficient perspective.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start of flying in the direction of the border area between Mexico City and Mexico state some low-hanging clouds.
Elected routes:
It is possible that the team because of the clouds lower area with better view, in the direction of the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording the helicopter agree perhaps it has been a deviation from the flight route before the impact of a loss of control over the plane.
The remains of the plane scattered in a limited area.
Until now, this information suggests that the helicopter was aufgeprallt from and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft residues suggest that the helicopter was aufgeprallt with its intact structure on the ground.
There is no evidence of fire or explosion.
The remnants of the aircraft are at the scene of an accident either on fire or explosion.
The latest findings point to several ground contacts.
During the investigations on the ground, aircraft parts to a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is abschüssig and has a Schrägung from seven to thirty degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a painstaking search in an area that went beyond the cordoned off area at the scene of an accident, could not be found scattered aircraft parts, which reinforces the assumption that the intact aircraft structure on the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for the location of the gene for obesity in
Social Security Institution, Mexico's leading a research project for the location of the gene for obesity among children and young people, which will be supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Security Institution of Mexico) announced that a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity among children and young people under the title "genetics of obesity in childhood and youth," with which the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department for medical research, focus biochemistry) at the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, health workers, food specialists and social workers.
This team will be supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate degree course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to take part in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 am tests with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation on the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state México) began since 8 October at the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the Federal state México) will continue.
If the goal of 500 to 600 individuals is achieved, the study on the sports ground of Independencia (in the south of the main urban bezirks) continued and Morelos (in the north of the main urban bezirks).
He said that the aim of the study is the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said it would seek three thousand children and young people aged from six to 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents should fill nutritional questionnaires.
They are also questions about their physical activity and their family illness history, risk factors, diabetes or renal insufficiency, to control.
He also led to the aforementioned Samstags investigative subjects measured (weight, size, Taillenumfang), controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as the glucose levels, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with obesity in childhood).
Cruz López stressed that the investigation would take advantage of the health workers concerned about the alarming weight of young people.
"The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that in less than six years, the proportion of obese boys 77 percent and the girls with obesity had increased by 47%, while obesity has risen dramatically," said the expert of the IMSS.
He admitted that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population of the differences in other nations.
He admitted that a (e) Mexicans (in) to 65% on average indianisch American, European and 30 to 5 percent of African descent in the genes, which is associated with diabetes and obesity,.
More generally, he said, the genetics of obesity in the inability to burn the surplus of energy (calories) burned, so that this will be stored in the form of fat.
The researchers said that the direct benefits for the research participants would be in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even the appearance of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and arm of the Innenarm (Akanthosis) on the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage.
All the information would be kept confidential and told the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors say parents all measurements and propose lifestyle changes, which are for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López said that there would be three basic factors that are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, the lack of movement on a daily basis, most of the time of the day in front of the television and means of transport to go, rather than short routes.
The high caloric intake, which means an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and Kohlenhydraten (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), along with a high fat and protein, as well as genetics, which is to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry in the Mexican University UNAM developed with Polymeren modified Asphalte to mix more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
The which stem from the road surface, respected, it would not be required to repair nearly 200 000 potholes, when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the Asphaltbelags happen, the number of potholes significantly reduced or avoided altogether.
"Potholes from a technical point of view," he in his speech on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with Polymeren modified Asphalte was developing, in a similar mixture, but the asphalt mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate, such as, for example, in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road surface and to avoid the appearance of blow holes.
He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - a hydrocarbon link, which is part of a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part of a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the road surface his characteristic zähelastisches behavior.
Zähelastisches behavior Asphalts means that this high temperatures of nearly 180 °C behaves like a liquid at 120 ° C, it is very liquid and 50 ° C, while he is fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resilience of the asphalt is not uniform on the streets, but on a day in accordance with the changing weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
The researchers said the FQ, the streets of Mexico City would have a majority of a flexible road surface, which is composed of six layers of material, which included the last three asphalt.
Between the upper classes is a wear layer of asphalt, which is made up of small and then solidified stones bathed in asphalt.
Each piece this decay class, was bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles to move and forces produced this situation is a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it is modified asphalt, the forces would be even better," said the chemical engineer.
"The erosion," he said, "is being interpreted in a recent class, the so-called Tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, from sand, which was also in asphalt.
Since this situation in contact with the car tyres, they need greater mechanical strength than the wear layer and they must produce friction.
The road surface receives the most forces and distributed, the Tragschicht also needs an appropriate thickness and the material from which it must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are more important to take into account factors, above all, the water, "he said," because it affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
If the site is damp, water in the class and only difficult, and this is a dilution of all sections of the road surface and as a result, the incidence of stroke holes.
If a pothole, "he said," will initially cover layer worn out, while the wear layer that will be affected, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that the first signs of adequate maintenance programmes should be maintained. "
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National research system Mexico) said that the burden of another important reason for the appearance of blow holes. It is therefore crucial that the thickness of each layer of the surface is always in relation to the vehicle and it must be ensured that frequent potholes with this rule will be met.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research to achieve Asphaltemulsionen, for example, which in other countries are already on the market, and with which the bumps simply and without application of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle, the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that played that Melina Ramírez Serna was the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets its 14 title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the awarding of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time had to Melina Ramírez Serna content to stand on the podium, a silver crown and the band, which they regard as the new Miss Colombia to flaunt.
With this night received result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the Department is already at 14 and Melina to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had been kept the crown almost in the hands of the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question many are asking is: What was missing?
The result is in line with the decline of a great favorite in any demonstration had shown that they had anything new to be Miss Colombia, but it was not in vain to the Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie elected by Vogue, titles, including the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor, which is regarded as crucial to the decision of the panel to appoint the first failure, is that the answer to the question "what book has most influenced and why?" of Martín Murillo Gómez Carreta aria Leamos, was not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I think pretty much of the literature, I think it is a kind of civilised way, ultimately, I believe that the book, which for my childhood," the little prince "is a very profound book.
At the moment I read "guilt and atonement." it is a book of universal culture, which we should all read, but I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, which says'passions'.
An answer, which was met with skepticism, firstly because of the term'civilised" and, secondly, because it had not explained how each of the book had affected them.
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the result: "the universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done.
And for all people: please read a little bit of "The small prince '; it is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is charred.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that it was the, all Beifälle einheimste and had all prices in the runup to Easter gastronomy competition, public vote on the best handgeschneiderte costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealously what the Queen stresste, who could not shine on the stage."
And it noted in its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and its two elevators in the coronation ceremony.
Although it appeared in both safe, it lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "Como en casa" on the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate who wins the most prices during the competition, but will not be queen."
In addition, Valle was at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle cannot convince the Jurie regarding their interest in social work, which is the essence of the national beauty contest.
It is a reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who stood up for the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. We must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social perception that they participate in the competition had been involved in projects," she said.
There is also speculation that Valle with their Derriere and fibrosis defects found in the stomach area, has said that he had sinned, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose it as a candidate for "natural beauty" with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but the problem with the fibrosis in the back, which for me to be honest, it was hard to say, put their score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos magazine, the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca the surgery, which she had undergone.
"The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how they get it right.
Her body has never been their strong side, and they had to pay. "
As a result of this prize, which is the first time will be awarded by the National beauty contest, after the appearance in a cruel prediction, which should be true in the night, and it was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize was given to them not to come to the enjoyment of the crown.
Regardless of whether it is true or not, the fact that Melina today assumes its domination of the year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers the opportunity to the appointment of the Colombian national beauty contest in one of the international competitions.

This was the work of the doctor, who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoskopist from Cali as the man who "Alfonso Cano" identified in history.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On 4 November, a Lophoskopist the investigative unit of the Public prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali as the man who the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) confirmed: "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of CTI, this week Eliazar González on-call time, a man from Puerto Tejada for 21 years is cooperating in criminal investigations and proceedings.
At the beginning of his career working in communities of Chocó, where he had to go often five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies were found, he should identify.
2000 siedelte after Valle on and after the completion of the necessary specialized courses on Lophoskopie, which is the investigation of the skin is exposed to the friction, i. e. the hand and foot.
In the week of the campaign against the so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar pointed out, put clothes for at least three days.
Great things expected of him.
Friday night he flew in the helicopters from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that there was a suspicion that the man who had guided the oldest guerrilla in the world, and that is why he should Guillermo León Zehnfinger-Abdruckblatt Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached with the Untersuchungste the place where the body was, he could not identify because of his physical appearance, because this resembled the images he had seen in the mass media, not in the least.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a Pflanzkelle and a pocket lamp Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the vote.
He was right: it was "Alfonso Cano."
The same night was responsible for this man from Puerto Tejada for the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to say that it was the head of the FARC.
In the track
For a Daktyloskopen from Sijín in Cali was that the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the use of "Cano ," very important.
Many people do not know our work.
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the dissolution of a criminal offence.
Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they also support an investigation into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
In their arrest, many criminals are false identity papers or they do not.
We are taking fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researchers told us that he had to grab a theft of a piece of wall from a house, because the thief had aufgestützt exactly at this point, with his hand when he stuffed with jewelry and money herauszog safe.
"The walls are difficult, because their surface are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case, we have been able to take the shot in the hand and the offender, who had participated in several thefts, identify," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints murder suspects can also be relieved or contaminated.
Recently, one death, surrounded by bottles of spirits.
During the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be tatverdächtig and a fingerprint actually agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that the murderer, but he will be the place where the crime was committed.
A Daktyloskopist of CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen were taken away from the object."
If they appear, a Pflanzkelle or a band will be used for the carriage.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, that is the criminal database, or Personenstandamt.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," said the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything is as it was portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as it is not all gold that glitters is not everything it touches, a fingerprint.
But it can be used if an appropriate comparison.
The "Empörten" call on the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators huddling in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
A large part of the eviction order and changed his location in a nearby park.
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street on Tuesday, the authorities of New York when they tried again with a court warrant to enter the Manhatten Square after they had been removed from the room and had tried a different place in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators huddling in the Zuccotti Square, in which they are with a court warrant, the "Empörten" once again allowed tents at this point, to gain access. Meanwhile, another part of the movement of the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where it came to nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to campen on the Square, we find ourselves in a different place, and the battle with legal means to return to the Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the movement "Ocupy Wall Street."
Bray said that the response of the "Empörten" on the evacuation of their tent camp, which directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York had been ordered to court, where judge Lucy Billings issued an injunction banning the forced evacuation of the place and the demonstrators to the tents.
In addition, occupied the "Empörten" a New park, which is at the crossroads of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue in the vicinity of the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, the New York and New Jersey, and the property of the Trinity Church.
They were able to place at least one hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although no precise figures Bray. He assured the Efe agency that he saw including several journalists in handcuffs.
The organisation said it had joined hundreds of people at this point, in which a delegation of religious leaders as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and communicating with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a site in private property) closed in anticipation of a court hearing is scheduled for this Tuesday, and with which the legality of the evacuation took place in the night to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators wore photographic copies of this court warrant and distributed them; they gave them some of the policemen guarded the place, "some small clashes ," as reported Bray, who had indicated that some police officers, had beaten demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street to remove from the room, as well as the use of "laws, which were adopted after the occupation and to prohibit the demonstrators with their tents and other things that they had already been used to return to the park."
Mayor Bloomberg is clearly in front of the press, which as a result of this court orders the reopening of the place for the public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted, and the demonstrators, he pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to return to this place with tents and sleeping bags.
The mayor defended himself in his grey conducted evacuation of the Zuccotti Square, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and it was decided, because the demonstrators" contravened the law. "
Bloomberg said that he had given the order to the evacuation of the place, because he "had turned into a place where people were not Demonstrieren, but to break the law and, in some cases, other people to harm," because "some shops have received threats" and the residents began to "about their quality of life."
"The evacuation of the dawn was sickening and shows that Bloomberg is essentially on the protection of financial interests and is not interested in protecting the interests of the North American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, the mayor anschuldigte "not to respect the freedom of the press."
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street informed that they thought about it," major actions "to organise for Thursday, together with community organizations and unions in the two months, the protests since 17 September now.

They, along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities will be on 1 December in the TV programme, "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian citizen Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen assistant in "Home Improvement" rescue in "Baywatch," rabbit in "Playboy," the wife of the rock musicians Tommy Lee and now the actress and model in a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television the Virgin Mary.
The private television channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (Balladensänger), Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on 1 December in the TV-Programm "it's a Russell Peters deserve" and a very special Virgin Mary breathe life.
CTV widespread today pictures of the television programme, in which Anderson - the spread on the Internet of a rolling pornography, in which they, along with her former husband, the Schlagzeugspieler of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, as Virgin Mary with a doll in the womb, which is supposed to be.
The scene seems Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian indigenous origin, who recently as moderator of the "My Violent torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, worked as a child.
The Christmas programme of CTV does not only on Anderson and Peters, in addition to the Canadian singer Bublé, at the end of March in Buenos Aires, the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato married, and this controversy is not far away.
Recently, Bublé in one of his concerts in New York, the North American Kim Kardashian described as a "whore."
Japan will be reborn after the earthquake
The GDP is growing by 1,5%, thanks to the domestic consumption and stop the cycle of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March was paralyzed the Japanese economy, which is still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake, which einmündete into a nuclear crisis and the worst catastrophe that Japan had lived through the second World War.
The initial estimates of the government in Tokyo evaluated the property damage at $300 000, a which, despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of case, the details of the gross domestic product between July and September, finally to close this chapter: GDP grew by 1,5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% of the year hochgerechnete quota.
In the second quarter, the measured value - in Japan the year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part through the sale of machinery for the rebuilding of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated areas.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1,1% compared with the decline of 0,9% for capital expenditures, which were recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of relentless increases.
Nevertheless, the real turnaround of the Japanese economy is not exclusively from Keynesian stimulus, using the crisis to build infrastructure or build new ones.
Awakened Japan in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, initiated by the growing spending on cars, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of yen
Tokyo has entrusted to the domestic market, after the yen - the Japanese currency - in one of the "safe haven currencies" of investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the gloomy forecasts for the U.S. a., a privilege as a gravestone rests on the accounts of the export companies.
With a stronger currency are the products more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September on the listing of the yen.
While the markets continue to besieged the peripheral EU countries, the government Yoshihiko Noda vigilant.
"We must pay attention to the continuing risks, for example, the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday, the Secretary of State for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are not really very aufheiternd.
The Organisation for economic Cooperation and development (OECD) said that most of the member states in September contained clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development.
The indicator, which ahead-takes the turning points of the world economy, brought to light that the brakes would be the biggest economic powers.
Because he fell by four tenths up to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone is even below the average of 100, after it fell by eight tenths on 99.13 points.
Athens casts doubt again
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums in the peripheral countries and insecurity among disruptive Greece strays in the labyrinth that of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek interim government is more likely is a response to pressure from Brussels as a genuine conviction of political forces, slowly by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the agreed at the time of his appointment a hundred days may be too short for their implementation, assured the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, that the new austerity measures and support and in any case, his call for new elections on the planned date of 19 February, will be back.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," assured Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government will reach its peak.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, the reform of the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samaras communication acknowledges the doubts about his position: "We have committed to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing."
The conservative leader was a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body of the 8 000 million Athens urgently needed entsperren, and he made it clear that he would not be undertaking on the implementation of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, because of the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum is still irritated, yesterday reaffirmed its demand was not changed: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "a clear written agreement as soon as possible" to sign.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the troika "very soon" to return to Athens, in order to discuss with the new government, "for the payment of the sixth section of 8000 million euros" is needed, "although there is still no final date.
The Greek tangle has for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position in Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has world a dominant position in the role of the public financing."
The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded yesterday that Spain is in the last two decades around the world for the second donor to this means of international cooperation. The "essence" is based on the fact that it was a "tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole of humanity on the basis of trust in the people ."
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth world summit on micro-credit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there is "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to the United Nations by the year 2015 to achieve the millennium goals and "especially the goal, the number of people with incomes of less than a dollar a day, below the poverty line ."
Spain "will continue to work on the expansion of the network" until the last corner of the world, and it does this task responsibly, "said the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, will be" the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women, "as the main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed.
"We have many successes recorded" and "face many challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to push "two fundamental goals."
The Queen said that it will be that by the end of the year 2015, 175 million poor families have access to these financial services and that 10 million of these households will exceed the poverty line.
The concept of micro-credit in Spain and the rest of the world Muhammad Yunus, "a few years ago initiated way back" to the Queen Sofia as a "act of justice and recognition."
The father of this financial instrument described it as a "admirable idealists committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work they have known for 15 years ago, when the Queen visited Bangladesh to learn about the lending strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later the first world summit in Washington and further meetings in the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "we are witnessing a steady development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday the assessment as "the head of the family" in Valladolid and as a "advocate of the poor."
Finally, the Queen Sofia ended her speech by the people to participate in the debate and to search for solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity "an ethical imperative" for the whole of the democratic state.
In this sense, he said, it was a mistake to link development aid in times of economic boom, because it was a "lasting commitment."
Jiménez was of the opinion that the micro-credit is a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty," and that the governments of the industrialized countries are now "more than ever," would have to work for solidarity criteria, and not to allow the solidarity of the crisis.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the most important forms of development aid. "
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "success ,"" marginalized "people," the are always closed doors "to give" hope "and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, the present in a city," its doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity ."
The CDU proposes that the EU president due to choose general vote
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic party, without any real trouble.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but has prevailed in the autumn, especially for those activists to make the government policy regarding the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The presidential motion proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Under 1001 delegates had only nine, ten had abstained from the vote.
The several minutes of standing ovation on the basis of which Interventionserlässen at first, Angela Merkel, as well as a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, were not by the three European zugeneigten Finance Minister no doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor, as well as the Antrage - the following slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less but more Europe."
It is not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could come through the control of the European Union, reinforcing modification of the Treaty of Lisbon on the budget policies of the countries in the euro zone, as it could also be in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general vote "in order to give Europe a face."
But in any case, this is one of the amendment proposals approved by Congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the cause, and the chief of the CDU think to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
But the milestone is.
Similarly, the delegates in an overwhelming majority the proposal of the weighting of each country according to the executive Board rejected the weighting of the individual economies, which is obviously a strong position in Germany.
The calming the climate within their party Chancellor has therefore reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, however, it has not tried to Congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulties to win immediately criticize the arrogant Germany immediately.
As far as the resolution of the importance of the "Franco-German friendship" a clause, Angela Merkel, France does not call on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because it reminds us that Leipzig two centuries ago, at the centre of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeat of the Napoleonic army.
What represents the fraud in health coverage?
After the family benefits UMP and government health reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday, 15 November arrive in Bordeaux to visit a family aid fund and a speech on the - has already been in place since 2007, the recurring theme of the fight against social fraud, as well as to raise economic dependence on the state.
In order to accompany this attack, which comes from the desire to take the economy in a tough test, on the other hand, however, no less a harbinger of an axis of right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee health reports.
The First haushaltswirtschaftlichem goal: the government is aimed at the introduction of a fourth Karenztag before taking a health care speech Krank workers in the private sector.
In plain English, this means that a sick worker without the approval of the specific company would lose the wages of four days, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the newspaper "Les echoes" threatens to provoke anger, would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And with a different measure more symbolic nature: the state officials in an unvergüteten Karenztag in sickness (so far there is for them, in Gegensatze on the three days of waiting in the private sector, no waiting period).
Meanwhile, these issues in the debate, sparked by the majority of the fraud, and this time the abuse associated with labour shortage.
"Checks will be much more important, and they are also rückzuvergüten, if that is required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this reporting about the reality of fraudulent activities in the field of health information is a little unproportioniert.
This is, in fact, has already been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as political offensive operations, which have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer ill more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
We are, however, with the nationwide figures.
According to the national health insurance fund CNAM, in 2006, more than EUR 237 million daily compensation paid.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of health care, the daily compensation in 2008 with 11.3 billion euros, 5% of health spending.
Under this amount fell 46% on maternity leave and occupational accidents and 54% on sick leave, heiβt EUR 6.2 billion.
And, therefore, 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group on average only 14.5 sick days.
An average, which masks some differences: a different monster in 2007, the website for career planning, has been published, showed that 75% of the 40 000 French workers claimed to have taken a single Krankentag.
Another, this time by the health insurance study makes it clear that 37% of health coverage in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11%.
Compared with their European neighbours, the French workers tend not more than elsewhere, to work.
One in 2010 by two researchers from the French national Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) conducted long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absenz ratio (the reduction or otherwise) oszillierte in France between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in health coverage represents a very small proportion in terms of undeclared work.
With regard to the fraud will be achieved only a weak Ausmaβ.
Encouraging the legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatische controls on health coverage exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public universities for education and training of technicians and engineers) below 1.5 million checks found that 13% of the 285 000 of the short-term health coverage, which means in 37 050 cases, "unjustified or too long."
When it comes to the systematic controlled cases of more than 45 days duration was 11% from 1.2 million in "unangepaßt or unjustified" cases, which means 132 000.
This is a total of 169,000 cases of "unjustified" several million workers who have been, in force.
A paragraph, which is only a weak Ausmaβ against, for example, the black economy.
According to the UMP-Abgeordneten Dominique Tian, author of a report published in July on this issue, it is between 9 and 15 billion euro tax loss per year, i. e. more than the total cost of daily expenses, and thus far more than the Defraudation in the last.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece has a new adjustment programme needed to absorb its economy.
This has had on Monday, 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament in Anfügen the fact that his government from the European Union granted a hundred days were not enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to find a strong of the economy, we need to support our European partners, as well as a new programme of fiscal adjustment," said the head of government in his first public speech at the Eröffung the debate on the vote of confidence by the Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the euro summit on 27 October, the "primary task" of the new government, with the participation of the country within the euro zone "at risk ," he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the public deficit of the country, "the 9% of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year, after the 10.6% in 2010 and 10.6% in 2009.
The rights rejected the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had on Monday its consent to the previously approved measures for the escape attempt from the debt crisis, but said that his party would not erkären to an additional Sparmaβnahme erkären.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at an assembly of his party new Democracy.
He had agreed with the requirements of the reduction of budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, however, has been hostile to any policy that would stop the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU-Kommisar charged with economic and monetary affairs, which had prevented the IMF and EU need loans over EUR 8 billion not without a written guarantees from all parties on whose support of the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word is enough, and he would sign under pressure from Auβen.
Euthanasia and accompanied Freitod must be legalised, a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel said that governments, institutions of health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder treatment worked together for the best pain relief funds, and this also goes beyond the cases of cancer.
The Canadian society is living in a state of denial about the death.
Only 9% of Canadians are in fact, with their doctor to talk about the conditions under which they wish to die and make provisions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved in various disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine, are interlinked.
This body recommends that the government to amend the criminal law, in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election, and in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.
As a prelude to the experts cite a recent poll by the independent EIU society, the quality of death in 40 countries compared to the world.
Although Canada has placed on the 10th, the study noted that "the medical care in Canada has a culture in which people are afraid to bring up the subject of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, tell us the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the overwhelming majority of Canadians to die at home, but ultimately die 68.6% of those in hospital.
The whole country, the rate of 86% in a hospital deaths occurred in Quebec.
In the sensitive issue of euthanasia and accompanying etem suicide, the authors of the report to conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already geäuβert, any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanying etem suicide to.
Now, however, there are, according to the experts who have inspected all those countries whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalized or decriminalized, no evidence that such a decriminalization Miβbräuche in their application, which is the practice of euthanasia or etem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting individuals would entail.
On the contrary, we meet considerably more cases of such violations in the countries where there is no legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide, such as Jocelyn Downie yesterday, a co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Suicide is practised in Canada, although clearly illegal," said Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let us remind ourselves that had carried out in 2010, according to an Angus Reid poll showed 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia, because they are of the opinion that these people would be at the end of her career to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the issue of euthanasia did not lead to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people less value besäβe.
As for the people who have already assisted suicide, the respondents represented 41% of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
As for maintenance or suspension of the funds for patients situation is less clear, as the authors of the report.
It also in their recommendation list suggests that the criminal law should be indicated that the dumping of funds, for which a legal opposition, not as a criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for professionals in the health care professionals should be trained in the task, a set of the funds at the end of life to be respected, and this without fear criminal prosecution.
The panel said that governments, institutions of hygiene and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment, in order to provide the best palliative funding, and this also goes beyond the cases of cancer.
Finally, the body is calling on the Canadian health care institutions far-reaching used to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender unorthodox measures, at least to consider, because they just like euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and bezögen on the same procedure.
Other experts reservations
Some experts in the field of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report put forward by the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has the attitude of the berichtsunterzeichnenden experts among others described as "extreme ," the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final stage no borders.
"This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone tired and older than 18 years, another person to ask him to be involved in his suicide," RA Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to be the responsibility of the individual over all other values, which are involved in social knitted of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and commitments in a society."
Margaret Somerville, specialist in health law, also has "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which they as "per euthanasia manifesto ."
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular, the report claims on the freedom of abuses in certain countries in which euthanasia and assisted suicide, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.

The United States, for its part, the "intensification of the consensus against Assad, as well as the actions of the Syrian regime" due to the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, EU, Arab League and countries such as Turkey, in the face of repression in Syria an ever more fiercely tone," observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this period, at least 16 civilians and 19 members of the ruling power in the region of Dar'an in the south of Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH.
Two other civilians were according to the NGOs" fire and heavy bombings at Jobar "in the besieged city Homs died.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid Moallem still believes that the country is heading towards the end of the crisis. "
He has, in fact, with emphasis on the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which in his view, is a "dangerous step."
Syria "will not give in," he added under the rhetoric, "the mied plot against Syria would fail."
After the decision to the suspension of Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "mechanism for civilians" and wants to see the deployment of 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media, as well as military observers in the country.
The French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of the deployment of U.N. observers, civilians against repression of the regime that he, in his "paranoia" encapsulates itself.
A auβerplanmäβige Neuversammlung the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat, the implementation of the plan to Krisenaustieg decided on 2 November, in particular the controversial anticipated withdrawal of military forces from the besieged cities, as well as to discuss the release of imprisoned protesters.
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the decision of the Arab League yesterday as "incorrect" in order to guard against a possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had warned Syria has already on the implementation of the Krisenausstiegsplanes.
Italy
He calls on the markets of patience and Italy to sacrifice on
Mario Monti, the future Italian leader has called for by the markets a little more time to build its staff and implement a programme that "victims" abfordere to recover during the last few months of the Berlusconi government lost creditworthiness.
The former European Commissioner, yesterday before the current clash of trade unions and employers a negotiation with the political parties.
It was his job to convene a cabinet to parliament, which is relatively strict from external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," Francesco Mr Nucara, one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after he had met with the President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had to wait for Mario Monti Parliament until Friday a vote of confidence, in order to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The arrangements will be in the presentation of m. Monti culminate a deletion list, without doubt, a dozen of ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented yesterday's nervousness of the stock and bond markets called for their time.
In "a democracy, there are certain deadlines" to prepare for a government, as well as a government program, he said in the statement seie "sure that the markets will show gedulig and reasonable."
His appointment by the president was welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had, especially after an unexpected industrial production decline in the euro zone in September.
The incumbent prime minister should be an existing team composed mainly of technocrats, even though he had to, "politicians ."
The new government should only until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government until Friday should be given the confidence of Parliament.
Monti has committed since the start of his role in all urgency to work in the spirit of the goal, Italy to the "new leader" in Europe.
A spokesman for the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis to the Italian economy, taking into account the new government does not change."
The EU is convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of budget reconciliation in the year 2013, despite these last few months apprehended austerity plans, in particular, new Härtemaβnahmen requested.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of the bosses "of Italy, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, is also on the need for the economy," as a country that has no growth record deficit figures cannot be respected. "
M. Monti, who is known for his expertise and his independence as an European Commissioner (1994 - 2004), for "epochal change" in Italy after 17 years, "Berlusconismus ";" professor "symbolises the" challenge of trustworthiness "and" other Italy, "the editorial writers.
The groβe unknown here is seie the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, Italy from now until April 2012 for 200 billion euros of government bonds.
Russian scientists will help the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, Iran has helped to develop a nuclear weapon usable detonator, confirmed on Monday, a specialist on nuclear risks, American NGOs.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS advises the result is based on the recent report by the International agency for nuclear safety AIEA and other documents on the basis of this UNO-Agentur to identify the scientist.
The AIEA announced last week its "serious concern" at a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to a study of the AIEA ISIS documents from the 1934 Danilenko apparently born since the beginning of the 1960s, more than three decades in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Urals), and was involved in the explosion produced synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he should have left the center in order to start a business in Kiev, which produces "nano-diamonds."
The economic difficulties of his company would have had him in 1995 to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine.
Before his return to Russia, he was in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report mentioned the AIEA "strong indications that the Iranian development of a" Nuklearsprengstoffsystems "had been supported by the work of foreign experts, not only in this technology äuβerst well-versed seie, but also, as a member of the agency, his entire professional career on essential to this technology directly on the military nuclear energy programme of their country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50%
The directed against Muslims crimes and offences have increased from 2009 to 2010 by 50%, whereas other racially or religiously motivated crimes of violence, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday in the same period either slightly decreased or increased slightly.
According to this data is the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, has risen by 49%, whereas a 13% increase in the number of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% drop in crimes against Jews, as well as a global increase of 14% of religious crimes and offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" in a very weak Maβe 6628 cases, including 47.3% racial differences and 20% motivated by religious differences crimes, such as the FBI.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is disturbing that these crimes and offences will grow again," said the human rights organisation human rights First, "the rise of anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organisation added in a statement.
"Human rights First, had been stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes as a serious infringement of human rights should be considered," added Paul Legendre, a representative of the organisation.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added under assessment that this improvement in the police attitude towards the "hate crimes" could be carried out.
The "hate crimes" is in the U.S. federal law as a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King, in order to punish acts of violence directed against race, colour, religion or ethnic origin, and now also offences of sexual identity.
Twitter is changing the platform and more and more Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter has introduced on Monday, changes in the presentation of its platform, in order to allow their users, in particular, to monitor the activities of those who follow their entries, which are similar to the service once again, those of Facebook.
The new Tab "activity" and another "name" make better leserliches live reconstructing the activities of other "Twitterer" of Internet users, whose news (" tweets ") and follow your news.
This makes it possible to find out whether it will allow it to pursue their messages, whether they are new contributions, favor certain news, etc.
This new Twitter offer menu was before his general Internet spread on Monday "in August with a small percentage of users" had been tested, the Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner before the French news agency AFP.
Twitter was known for his little instinctive functioning, peppers with a little esoteric sounding wording (RT referenzierten of the contribution of another person). Followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur of initiés" ouvre ainsi an un public plus large avec un maniement plus status a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google +.
The network of users with the help of certain "tweets" on the Internet about this innovation.
"It is useless, intrusive and is similar to Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"The function of" activity "will help me to pursue certain elements of my Flux Twitter better," said @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
The of a "golden budgetary rule" in the constitution.
The Austrian government in power of the large Socialist / Christian Democratic coalition has decided on Tuesday to include a "golden" fiscal rule into the constitution, in order to reduce public deficits and a possible degradation by credit rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, personally, this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian state debt 74.6%, far above the set by the Maastricht Treaty criterion of 60%, but well below the debt levels of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"The solvency of Austria not in one fell swoop from AAA to AA +, we would have three billion euros each year to pay interest rates," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democrat Auβenminister.
Austria is also a requirement of the Brussels summit of the Member States of the euro zone on 26 October: the heads of state and government would have been at that time, the inclusion of reducing public deficits by the end of the year 2012, as well as a return to the public accounts in the Constitution or by adopting a similar law.
The Maβnahme taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model," because Germany was the first European country that such a "rule" was included in the Constitution.
By the year 2017, the structural budget deficit every year to 0,75% of gross domestic product (GDP), from 2017, the structural budget deficit of the federal state should 0,35% of GDP does not exceed, whereas the regional states, as well as the communities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is on the horizon of 2020/21 to eradicate the budget deficit below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht treaty.
Strong yen
Noda is threatened with a new intervention in currency markets.
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda on Tuesday warned that the Japanese authority would intervene in the currency markets if the yen should continue to rise.
"We should see an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, "we will intervene, just as we did last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen, in turn, close to the aufgeschnellt historical levels, which the Japanese authorities had forced the intervention on 31 October.
On this day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against the dollar, in order to reduce the Japanese currency value, which is hitting a new record since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has risen regularly doped by purchases by investors, the yen as a "refuge" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro is below the symbolic barrier of 105 yen in the vicinity of the levels slipped, the last intervention getriggert.
Before the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009 listed 120 yen to the dollar, the euro more than 160 yen.
This whimsical Japanese motto is damaging to the exports of the archipelago, as the the cost of the "Made in Japan" products more expensive and drawn from abroad by Japanese firms, since they convert into the national currency.
"Japan has been struggling after the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March, the Tohoku region (North East) have been devastated, for its reconstruction," said M. Noda, who feared that the rise of the yen could kill the weak recovery in the bud.
The third world economic power, with the growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter, for the first time this year, thanks to the sharp increases in exports and consumption by the disaster, "plombierten" households once again gained traction.
The Prime Minister, however, estimates that the rise of the yen is not "the economic fundamentals of Japan am reflecting."
The Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for its part, the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee has urged to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, however, has informed the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures," which he said that no additional monetary easing on Wednesday was to be expected.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had its obligation acquisition of 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) increased to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) to pay off financial sums they had spent on various purchases of securities, in order to flood the market.
Euro zone.
Zinsfüsse skyrocketing, stock markets retreat
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis consistently undermined the European indices.
Despite the official opening of the new government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened Länders steadily growing.
The stock markets, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro zone, drifting this Tuesday, 15 November, a little bit more in negative pastures.
In Paris, the CAC 1.4% at 10 o'clock, and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0,4%, London at 0,1%.
"Due to the new tensions on the government-bond yields in the euro zone are in trouble, the global stock markets continue to release some of their recent gains.
"Investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters news agency.
The Tokyo stock Exchange, which, in turn, renewed fears of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe is suffering, that the debt crisis continues, had closed with a market downturn of 0,7%.
"Japan has directed as well as the rest of the world has its eyes on Europe, and the trade is on a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi investment management.
This revival of the concern about the future of the euro zone is damaging to the single currency, the Baiss on Tuesday.
The euro moved for one and a half months to its lowest level.
Around 10 p. m., the European currency worth 1.3570 newborn, they were 0.4%.
According to the stock market, it is, after the CDU party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered on Monday in Congress, a request has been, in particular, the possibility for troubled countries to withdraw from the euro zone, without at the same time to leave the European Union time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
The loan rates of Italy and Spain are still at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return of the Italian bonds 6,85% at 10 years, the fruit of the Spanish title to 6,2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continues to fuel the fears of investors.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for by the markets more time to the situation in Italy threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed, for its part, the implementation of the occasion of the 27 October summit meeting of the euro zone decisions were "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in Visir markets, since Sunday, the parliamentary elections in the country.
The interest rate gap (" spread ") between the German and Spanish 10 - year bonds has reached a new historic high.
In anticipation of growth figures for the euro zone
Statistically, France had a by the economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, so a little better than the expected 0.3%.
The statistical Office INSEE had, however, the market downturn revised the figures for the second quarter, with a deficit of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In truth, it is the fourth quarter, which economists most worried.
For its part, Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
An initial projection of the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 p. m., with the EU Commission warns against the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogma
There is an issue that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, so it is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity in direct impact on the purchasing power, as well as the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is reasonable to take an election for a reason, on this issue and think about the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if they explored all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should have their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, is not a huge proportion of the world's population on a vital element.
At the same time, we must reduce the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce steady electricity without the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue disappeared from the environmental debate, to forget, in order to fight against climate Unregelmäβigkeiten.
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters.
That is why blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision on the need to find a replacement substitutionsfähige source in Switzerland, which is just to build nuclear power plants in the last generation.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few states to pursue their projects against it with determination.
For its part, the United States have decided after Fukushima, their park another unit, the plant shut down after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in operation.
Even if the renewable energy sources, German model is sometimes as a model, but contradicts the reality of the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be an increase in the price of electricity prices, by the increased use of Importgas increased energy dependence on Russia, in particular, an increase in carbon dioxide emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark is cause for reflection.
Denmark is an European leader in wind energy, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, alternating with wind energy; so there are its CO2 Ausstösse, as well as its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours in contrast to our French households by 40% higher electricity bills.
As the price of energy in the globalised economy a key element of competitiveness, as well as a measure of stability in the industry on national soil, the French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in the nuclear power would be a strong increase in the price of energy, which the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power of illusion.
Polls showed that a price that the vast majority of French people, and neither is prepared to pay, as opposition to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remind ourselves that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export nature it brings a host of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises on the international markets and makes these creators of countless jobs.
If France decision to get out of nuclear power, it would be a large part of these SMEs fall victim, and the annual eur 6 billion euros in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
What electricians would be an EPR designed to operate at 60 years if the decline of its producers is inevitable?
In order to solve the energy equation, we must acknowledge that just a little bit like a devil, a miracle cure for the production of electricity.
The company Areva, low-carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy from the complementarity of energy sources.
To maintain the highest possible level of safety for nuclear power is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a safety authority, uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants such as, for example, is carrying out the construction in Flamanville.
Their teams, who have made a name to their professionalism, are the security obsessed.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only a single, and Three Mile Island, under normal operating conditions; it was without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl was the drama of reactor construction, as well as unendschuldbares, human error.
In Fukushima seem to forget that some of the accident of two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident, as well as after the two previous had done.
As a result of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power stations, the EPR is a draft of its resilience in the face of such phenomena possible.
Because it is considered among the electrical engineers as desirable to build a nuclear power plant, it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, giving them free rein to the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to dominate a debate emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber, as well as economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized for a variety of perspectives - congestion by police, judicial and administrative bodies because of the figures derived policy, this policy, this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students was marked by the authorities" side, the weekly schaus, the Interior Minister had in passing (see Libération on 23 May) announced that France "no talent, masons or waiters from abroad."
But this policy was only rarely from the economic point of view.
On this issue, there is a broad consensus between right and left.
> from the right side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900 people, including more than 2 million immigrierte workers, will pose no problem for a country," from left side by Michel Rocard, who had set out in 1990, France "could not take the whole poverty in the world."
The only difference is the level of generosity
The fear of invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumber was divided in 2005, both from the right and the left.
Both camps, the immigrants were seen as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity towards the immigrants who are willing to admit.
Francois Hollande is limited in its programme to which it to, partnership development, to solve our problems of migration ."
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, can have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Mr Cameron in a recent work, which the latest findings on the immigration (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), a broad consensus among the specialists about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
The immigration would invalidate the growth and the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening the indigenous workers, especially the less qualified to replace by exerted pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact essential complementary than the local wage workers, because they focus on the jobs in sectors that are unausgelastet the job.
The low skilled immigrants work in sectors, local wage workers poking little talented among immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which the training is not aligned with the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
As a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country where there is a lack of Anästhesisten, this complementarity between locals and migrants have a positive effect of immigrants immigration on wages and domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way, that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants is a miteinbezogene, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0,9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas put forward by the immigrants, as well as the economic growth is conducive to (high proportion of immigrants naturalized immigrants under American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute to the social systems in European countries, on average, for example, in an amount of 1% of the total budget.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that at the age of 30 years after Germany sea person the public budget on average, about his life a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of around 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate, the lack of intersection "with the teeth."
These teeth, which should deter immigrants, but achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, we will have to rethink the European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset, there is also a sensitive commodity.
The European continent should remind themselves, who after their invention in Athens, more than two thousand years ago, the entire 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of Holocaustes, the Gulag, but also in Franco's Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some were believed that it will be enough to exercise the right to vote, and direktest possible way for democracy once and for all to win over their enemies.
We know since Napoleon "small" that it was a feature of the spirit.
The general election law, the necessary condition of democracy is not a sufficient condition and may well be "repressive instrument ," as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation of powers and control, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, which we find ourselves in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and, above all, politics and democracy crisis.
The change of heart of the Greek casual counterfeiting referendum would have been doubly interesting character in this respect: the need for a powerful return of the policy, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing sense of the impossibility of their Unangebrachtheit.
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain, in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which, in accordance with the requirements and has been organised in a perverse sequence.
A free ticket for the European dictator or a leap into the void of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen.
No, we want to Hackebeil, but a collective task, quite rightly, clear and steady, an election and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, in fact, no longer where to put an end to the list - because there is only one crisis, and this is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, bowing to the dictates of the markets and the credit rating agencies, which is suffering from its impotence and his lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe, which is humiliated at international level.
It is concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - it is an Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and every one of its affiliated nations.
The urgency is to give the popular sovereignty, the leadership of the European project.
Because it is located on the whole, whether the Europeans reduce the burden of their debts, from the markets and to build a future investment.
The exit from the crisis has taken decisions at European level on the condition, which cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, without us quite sure to lead to destruction.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists fought for a long time, it is now pushing the European economic governance.
I agree.
But this without political integration and greater democracy - as they have in mind - that would be a renewed folly and another impasse.
We need a new stage of European integration.
In order to create the Republic in France, it took the Republicans to "create."
The revolution of interests alone was not enough.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to a better economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans to build Europe.
"Contact" smart cards will be introduced
The world fair opens for smart cards on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris optimistic attitude in their doors.
The year 2011, according to the smart with a 11% increase in worldwide sales of Mikroprozessorchips (debit cards, SIM cards), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The tragendste segment is the to contact free technology payments on public transport or settling purchases by simply keeping the card to a reading device.
Compared with a year earlier sold 320 million this year, 460 million contact smart cards will be sold worldwide.
Its market share should increase further (580 million expected units) and more than 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards) to in 2012.
Europe wins in terms of contactless payment to land after a long time in the Asia Pacific region is behind hergehinkt.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are modest: only 400,000 kontaktlose Visa cards have been distributed.
However, the consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued this year, 2.5 million contact passport master cards.
In order to move to higher speed, it is necessary for the banks to provide their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to their customers in future to systematically bank cards, which are drawn up with kontaktlosem chip," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of France.
Banks test payment via mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the road to the medium of the future: the mobile phone.
A tiny percentage of equipment is so far with the implementation of these transactions necessary NFC technology (Near Field Communication).
"You are in default."
"But they should at least next year a real upward trend."
"We expect in 2012 with the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," said Marc Bertin, chairman of the smart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced the launch of a Testlaufes in Caen, which will take place from December until next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and staff are to be fitted with a contact.
The BPCE is conducting a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had testified yesterday to prepare for the market introduction of an offer to their customers kontaktlose payment by mobile phone.
Terrorist front, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
It has long been under suspicion of relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice Auβenminister Abdel Kader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers now "certainty."
"The way in which both organizations, as well as the relations of the secret services point to a clear cooperation," he said without going into detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation on the last January abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger have promoted interfaces.
In a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi gekidnappten Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory are on the following day, at the same time as several of their captors during an operation carried out by the French special forces have been getöten.
French and Nigerian investigators want to be found in the rubble at the site several phone chips, which were the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the telephone calls leads to several interlocutors who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: a number leads to a Nigerian who for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram had stopped; the other leads to a man who, as the Aqmi and the sect close.
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt that we have to wait for clearer evidence before we can talk of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It is conceivable."
"You know for years that the sect financial and intellectual support of foreign policy, and that this is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In these last few months this "assistance" in its course has become ever more obvious, as well as the speeches, as well as the operational modes of Boko Harem, which is now on the arrival of suicide bombers, as well as the use of evidence always complex explosives, which bear the same hallmarks as those used by Aqmi.
The international community to begin in Washington, has been in place since that time pressure on Abuja to be there for the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have deemed the grouping, in fact, for a long time as a community of Illuminaten, no special attention.
Rapid success
In 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school, as well as the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf founded Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - the establishment of an Islamic sultanate in the Muslim north.
In this poor region, the merger of rapid success.
It is politicised and strict observance of Sharia law, while its affiliated activists in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists have first churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the Boko Haram militants stepped up attacks against the stations are particularly active.
The reaction from Abuja is, however, as usual, indifferenziert.
The army surrounded the city, it is one of 800 people dead.
In captivity, Mohammed Yusuf was killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical and leaves their strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas known to an attack in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is allocated to the of Selbstmordattentates, secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations to focus international targets.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, since all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and Niger, which operates Somalis of al Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, hatta Alain Juppé during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria warned against Boko Harem and shown itself willing to "all the evidence."
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry competing in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq, as well as the provision of aid to Israel.
Can a krisengeschwächtes America a complex world with simple, not to say: silly ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate, the voters could almost get that impression.
Over the past few days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and their supporters in their thundering declarations and statements on foreign policy, traditional Republican priorities, said repeatedly.
On China, Iran and Israel aid - often based in any way - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the top of the course Mitt Romney threatened to cite the Chinese before the WTO and the "currency manipulation" - leading issue in an America that the exodus of entire industries to Asia strongly prefer not to blame.
Stupid, if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama, and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, almost about his schmeichelnden behavior strangled.
He had a firm, but constructive talks with Beijing (also the current position Obama's).
But Huntsman will not be heard, because he has stagnated in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to halting the nuclear programme.
"If I am elected, I commands Iran," he was on hearing.
"Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
In addition, Israel has increased military aid promised and Obama accused his partners on commitments to be.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, zweithöchst platzierter candidate, for its part, has a shameful acts of ignorance.
Recently, he called on the Chinese military threat against, because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to be the fact that China is already been in place since 1964 in possession of military nuclear weapons.
The Texas governor Rick Perry supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, for its part, is to be ready to take the American army in Mexico against drug cartels in service.
The Obama 2009 prohibits the use of torture against suspected terrorists was also of Cain, Perry, as well as the Kandidation Michele Bachmann advocates.
It is a far cry from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The current presidential opponent, Reagan had also simple ideas and won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama selbstein amateur and water in his wine had to pay, which was the subject anti-terrorist.
They are right to insist on the failure of his naive Zwiegespräches with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which he is also the reputation of the weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so straightforward.
The population estimates the positive assessment of the national security under Obama, Bin Laden has switched off.
Since the Iraq asserted against military intervention, which lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprised more by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt, in order to give its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which is at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and Western Europe unites directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with pomp and ceremony.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung and gourmet buffet the inauguration of the new gas pipeline Nord Stream, Russia and Germany under the sea links directly with each other.
The German Chancellor, Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolic joint turned the steering wheel of the channel, which the Russian gas transported into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through an initial pipeline of 1224 km, which the region of st. Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, will be delivered to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which has a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline of themselves.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this vast edifice as a victory.
The project was in Poland and the Baltic states strongly disputed.
The Nord Stream pipeline will provide a direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any route, through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) in the country.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of its power: it is now more difficult For them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close down access to western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate, has not shied away from the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new deutsch-sowietischen pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has won the endorsement of this Russian project an even greater security of supply.
This, however, at the expense of starvation of European energy, because the project has a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has managed in barely five years ago, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong Gasverbrauche and its gas reserves are becoming exhausted.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way," said François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out to what extent the groβen contracts from political and economic side are important.
All of this explains the broad smile in Lubmin number of Gazprom managers in terms of Gaszuleitung.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a prominent technology.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel and concrete casing, which is intended to protect them from ships berth.
It rests on the seabed around 200 metres deep.
Its construction had to be avoided from the Second World War previous minefields.
"Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
We also had to be taken more measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long queue of metal, difficult as 242 Eiffel towers over the entire length is interrupted by nothing: neither valves, or maintenance stations.
A control platform was off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have refrained from it, as the Swedes were little eager to a Russian state company in a permanent way to their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we are Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," Jens Müller clarified.
In the case of a leak gas in the gas pipeline escapes, into the air.
This case comes from the designers, however, as the approaches to the consistency of a leak was estimated per 100,000 years.
The state surveillance of the gas pipeline will be guaranteed by an underwater robot, controlled by an of from external virtue purposes, as well as a device that circulates in the pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, miβt a metre diameter, will be introduced into the pipeline and moved by the pressure.
After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device when it arrives very specific information about possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years, without even the slightest repair.
The Gaszirkulation will simply by pressure.
This is 200 cash to the access, 100 cash to the exit.
Five companies have combined their efforts to achieve this project.
The senior leadership, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF (to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company GDF Suez (to 9%).
These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream, which is charged with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in train in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then this society has rented the entire capacity of its Gastransportes and renewable 20 year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how great the real from transporting volume," added Mr Müller.
The financing of the baus gas pipeline to 30% of shareholders, as well as 70% backed by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the total investment, for example, 240 million.
The minority shareholders are, however, gewiβ to recoup their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline is a sandy, with pine forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 metres high valves are the Gasaustrittspforte.
Sensors to measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the arriving gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal with one million cubic metres of Russian gas supplies per hour.
At full capacity would be 3 million cubic metres per hour, as well as 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a notiz marker.
> From an Italian company about 15 years, Moleskine would like to give back new style to the letter.
It has a flair for adventure, by candlelight with the letter spent hours.
The notice of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with his black, rechteckigen cover, his elastic, eierschalfarbenen sides, such as aged over time.
The Moleskine note book, as we know it today, however, has been created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided at that time, a distinguiert designer notiz book on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, technical adviser of the company, is charged with the market introduction of the new product.
The notiz book was inspired by a traditional production technology, called mole skinhead (mole skin), which described a Baumwollack, for example, will be used for salary padded benches.
This kind of notiz book was among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has an old and almost forgotten subject to revive until the 20th century as icon pioneering artists was," explained Maria Sebregondi, now responsible for Modo Modo.
The success.
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increase by 26% and establish itself with sales of 12.7 million.
This is a far cry from the usual production in the first few years, in which only 3,000 record books were conceived.
Moleskine is the Italian border and will be carried out in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to prepare a phantom image of the buyer, as the book notice businessmen, as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image more cosmopolitan, cultured and intellectual customers.
The small Italian company, which in its early days was among 12 workers, now employs more than 100 employees and has been in place since 2008 on two offices; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookshops, Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of town centres and understands its identity.
"We have followed the spirit and his new desk needs, despite the recovery of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait which is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand exposure called "Detour (route)," in which architects and artists their own notebooks.
In August, the company at the film festival in Locarno also cover with leopard pattern on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and the cultural zeitgeist and showed it to diversify its products: pockets, diary, pen, computer... The brand, the whole range of articles.
A success, there are some begrudgers brings to the plan: in the autumn of 2006, Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and suggested that a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled people in such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are searching for a job.
Today begins the 15th week of work for the disabled. "
Despite the purposeful public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people has always been twice as high as the average value: 19% Arbeitlosigkeit 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, Éric Blanchet, director-general of the Association of Adapt" week of work for the disabled. "
"The fifteen years of progress."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, a great deal still remains to be done."
It must be said, however, that many obstacles remain for disabled people remain before they get a job.
More often, it is the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no baccalaureate and there are only 10,000 people among the 2.3 million students in higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled, compared with 38% in the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make a fresh start working, and the "heart of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association in 1992, the company is helping to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
The underlying implication, mentalities, certainly, but slowly.
A in April by the Association of IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité study, which surveyed managers have "a weak level of knowledge about disabled people," the "over-represented" of people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually less well-off. "
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987.
The latter, from the 2008 figures point to a ratio of 2,6%.
"We are now at about 3%," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is tasked with recovering contributions from companies that flout the law.
The proof: the number of "charges" plants has been reduced, as well as the amount of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, zahlenmäβig from 59.000 to 46.000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which provides increases, created a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement is also a real awareness, especially among the large firms groups."
According to the Ministry for work only 59% of the plants between 20 and 49 people disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 employees compared to 82%.
Hazard: "What a lucky"
Even before the "blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 p. m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens their pleasure, the friendship, not hide.
It would be too far to say that there have been a secret agreement between them, but the picture is symbolic volumes.
Side by side on the podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been and to be able to make peace.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his player attack against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had nothing but praise on his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I would like to look forward," the native Liller turn.
As far as the contrast between his presentation in the club and Nationalelf "it is an unity that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille throughout the year, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It is time for me to go to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint Denis, Friday night against Romania in terms of Matchs against France, at last, "to shine."
But without the note of the "pleasure ."
The French national team he fires since the age of 7 years, he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I have always supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to the "unique" nature of this meeting to increase even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be," he said.
"We have just gone on the road."
"To play against them can mean a great deal of luck!"
Leekens liess with bonhomie "pride ."
"The pride, a gala match ."
"Pride" - in his capacity as "neighbours" - to confirm that France "has become a team at a very high level," and little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a good job," he said.
Although Belgium is missing in the next European Championship, the technician looks very much the plane with the blue (the French Nationalelf) share... And Brazil in 2014.
"We small Belgians are powerful," he said.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will be included in the upcoming games." the game against France.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism about the return match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
The Hinspiel had both teams lacked objectivity.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will have a happy team and, above all, be a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao," his Nationalelf, for which he is responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, in fact, only 90 minutes sanctuary.
But there is a match to play, and abzuservieren an opponent, and Bosnia.
In view of the Hinspiels (0 - 0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the die has not yet been taken.
Portugal dominated for more than a hour of the game, but the team was not able to cause the important mark, which would have taken the pressure off her.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain amount of risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor."
At home, however, in their bright erstrahlend Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced, before an audience, which is to be hot in the game, even if the game, of course, was announced as a "very tight," said the optimistic, but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but they are completely convinced, to be able to gain the upper hand," said the 42 - year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of the Euro 2012 to be" watered down, however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia is forcing the Portuguese to achieve a goal and win.
A draw is also a gateway to the Bosnians, who have already been.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain amount of risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor," Bento regrets.
"We will be able to compete against a team, the high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese, already beginning to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians, "they have no time for reflection."
A good idea, provided that it will be implemented this time.
