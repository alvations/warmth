The European inflation slid in foods
The accelerated inflation, registered in the zone of euro, must in the first place to the vertiginous growth of the price of nutritional products.
The increase of the prices in the month of November has been superior to the hoped thing in the 13 countries of the zone of euro, registering - after the 2,6 percent of the month of October - an annual inflation of the 3.1 percent - the Office of Statistic of the Union with seat in Luxembourg announced.
The official forecasts only gave as probable a 3 percent - the Bloomberg announced.
The European Central bank (BCE), unlike the bank ofs issue North American, British and Canadian, did not cut the basic interest, under pretext of which the diminution, along with the prices in increase of the raw materials and the reduction of unavoidable unemployment, would cause an inflation spiral.
The BCE wants to maintain the rate of inflation underneath, but at least near the two percent.
According to an analyst, the BCE is in trap 22: "it is necessary to negotiate" on the inflation so that later it does not have to take part in this subject.
The inflation of the 3,3 percent, registered in Germany, broke the record of twelve anuses; whereas in Espana it increased of the 3.6 to the 4.1 percent.
The inflation went off in the zone of euro as a result of the galloping nutritional and power prices.
The quotations upon maturity of the wheat increased in a 88 percent and also the quotation of the soybean reached its maximum level from 1973.
Equally, it was necessary to pay much more in the 2007 by the vegetal oil and milky products.
The price of crude petroleum in the world-wide market almost increased to east anus in a 52 percent, reaching already the last month the black gold the 100 dollars the barrel.
According to the BCE, the inflation in 2008 it will jump of the 2.1 present percent to 2.5 percents, however for the 2009 it will diminish already to 1,9.
According to the analysts, the annual inflation will stay in next the 3 or 4 months around the 3 percent, nevertheless the annual average rate will be of the 2,1 percent.
At the same time, one hopes that during the anus the 2008 BCE reduces the types of interest twice.
Gallup anticipates a governmental crisis
After a long stagnation, for December principles the support of the Alliance of Democratic Young people increased significantly, reaching its maximum level from 2002, whereas the Gallup never before experienced a level so under - a 13 percent - in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the safe voters of the parties - due to the greater firmness of the voters of the opposition - would mean a support of more than two thirds (a 71 percent) in front of the support of a fifth part for the Socialists (a 20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of the Free Democrats would not reach nor the limit necessary to have some parliamentary escano: its support within the totality of the population is of a two percent.
Between the safe voters there is a one more percent of supporters in both sides.
The economic atmosphere even continued deteriorating itself in comparison with previous the lowest point - she has never been so high, a 41 percent the proportion of which judged specially bad the economic situation of the country, whereas another 46 percent thinks that the situation is quite bad.
The families, after the most hopeful expectations of the spring and the summer, now are more pessimistic as far as the change of their own economic situation.
In which one talks about the next anus, most of the population it counts on the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth part waits for an improvement.
In the month of December, the 71 percent of the consulted ones, number superior to any previous survey of the Gallup, considered that the rather desempena President of Government badly who well its functions.
The 13 percent of the consulted ones trusts or trusts much Ferenc Gyurcsány, whereas Viktor Orbán counts on the support of the 38 percent of the consulted ones.
A 54 percent of the population does not trust the Head of Government at all and a 27 percent does not trust the president of the Alliance of the Democratic Young people.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is of which, what proportion of the society thinks that it is possible to control the displeasure experienced in front of the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
Whereas after the disturbances of October of the last anus a 35 percent considered that he would be desirable to maintain in the power to the Government and the Head of Government, at the moment this proportion is of only a 20 percent, whereas the relative majority (a 33 percent) thinks that the only solution is the celebration of new elections.
The interest by referendo is characterized by the fact that the 60 percent of the encuestados ones to the question on the participation responded that would participate surely and another 20 percent said that is probable that it participates.
To comparative way, in "general elections to be celebrated east Sunday" a 55 percent of the population would participate surely only and another 15 percent creates probable their participation. With the present intentions of the voters it does not fit doubts of the result of the popular consultation.
A 74 percent of the population would disapprove the payment of the rights of studies, a 79 percent the one of the medical advisory service and a 84 percent the one of the hospitable attentions.
If we observed these proportions solely between the safe participants in referendo, the 81, the 84 and 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of the rights of studies, the payment by the medical consultations and the one of the hospitable attentions.
Most expensive it is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintuplicado its prices
The supermarkets of gold the commercial triangle of Budaörs maintained the increase average of the level of the prices of a 16 percent, with the difference of which this anus has not been increased the IVA.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
This anus also increased in an average of 16 percents in the commercial triangle of gold of Budaörs the habitual basket of Christmas of the Napi newspaper, but in all the supermarkets a growth was registered muy.superior.a the thousand HUF.
As in December of the last anus already "the prices in the food supermarkets had gone off", thus a percentage drastic increase in comparison with the high point was not experienced to begin with.
Nevertheless, evidently the fact that is frightful for the consumers what the last anus could buy very to a price below the nine thousand HUF, at the present time they cannot do it nor by ten thousands.
The basket of Napi in the studied supermarkets surpassed with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the basket of more high value was of 10 573 HUF.
(in the anus 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of the licor Unicum and the fish stayed almost in the level of the previous anus, but increase of the fillet of pechuga of turkey, of the nut and the seed of poppy was registered a fort.
The price of the flour of wheat and the bread followed the data of the Central office of Statistic, although in the Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread by the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
Also he was surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with redeemable bottle of two liters cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
, in the basket of Napi Auchan it was the most expensive, whereas cheapest Cora yet.
According to our calculations, with respect to the prices of Christmas of the passed anus, Cora increased with 15, whereas Tesco and Auchan with near a 18 percent the prices that appear in the basket of Napi.
Comparing the values of the most expensive basket of the anus passed with the one of the cheapest basket of this anus, the difference has been a 12 percent, whereas the growth between cheapest of most expensive the last anus and of this anus has been a 21 percent.
The average growth was of 1480 HUF.
The last anus the average growth of the prices was of 1206 HUF, so that during Christmas of the anus passed in the prices the increase of the IVA felt.
Exactly this process was the one that destroyed the commerce, the supermarkets visibly were incapable to make decision on the margin from prices to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of the change of the prices on the consumption.
(If the retailer plans bad the speed of the circulation of a product, can lose an important benefit in the margin that adjusts to the volume of sales.)
The increase of the price of the basket of Napi reached such ends as a result of the increase of the IVA, that most expensive was superior with 1720 HUF to the value registered in 2006, whereas in the more cheap difference it was only of a 844 HUF.
This anus such ends did not take place, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than the last anus and more cheap also it increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two navidenas seasons, a catastrophic growth in the prices in less was registered than 20 months, in the supermarkets grew more of the 30 percent the price of articles of consumption of first necessity.
(Nevertheless this not necessarily confirms the numbers of the Central office of Statistics: this office, in the case of some foods of first necessity registered in the interval of 12 months an increase of price superior to the 30 percent.
Thus for example, in addition to the wheat, also in the case of the egg.)
According to the basket of Napi, in this last case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already the anus passed in comparison to the base, it was registered, in worse of the cases as soon as a 10 percent of increase of prices.
According to all the indices, the flour providers have one more a position hard than those of egg, being able to even impose the drastic increase of the prices in the multinationals.
The supermarkets do not complain in the commercial gold triangle, speak constantly of positive results.
According to our gathered experiences, to most of the consumers of the three visited stores, no longer they interest the prices to them.
Of all products they buy great amounts, taking by trowels the conserved foods.
In the manana of Wednesday, in the three stores great tails in front of the boxes formed because it suddenly increased the number of the clients.
Nevertheless, we have information that in the rear area the volumes of sale are inferior, numerous multinationals also complain to the institutes of survey because the income are not solely below their plans and in the case of foods, but in the one the household-electric ones.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This anus has been registered in the hospitals several thousand of infections produced in the first place by the illegal application of antibiotics.
The ruling circumstances of hygiene in the hospitals, the hacinamiento of the beds and the overload of the personnel do not favor the control of the infections - the medical-female leader of department of the National Center of Epidemiología affirms.
In many hospitals it is even saved with disinfectants.
Not long ago it has been diagnosed I infect with MRSA in the department of traumatología of the János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident the presence of the resistant bacterium to antibiotics was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of I infect took place in this same hospital at the beginning of the anus.
To an wounded of a serious automobile accident they discharged from the hospital to him of the hospital and the same patient shortly after had to return to the hospital as a result of I infect with MRSA and since then it has not been possible to make an important operation by the presence of the bacterium in its organism.
Until the 10 of December of this anus 1094 cases of hospitable infection produced by multiresistant agents have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance - Karolina Böröcz said, medical-female leader of department of the National Center of Epidemiología.
This means that in the hospitals with complete certainty this amount of infections produced by multiresistant agents has been registered, of the rest does not have information.
Near the two third parts of the infections (683 cases) they must to the MRSA, is to say to the Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to the meticilina-oxacilina.
A third of the human beings aureus (SA) without causing disease takes in their nose the bacterium of Staphylococcus some.
The infections produced by the SA (by ej.: cutaneous inflammation of the throat, tonsilitiss, infections, hurt infections of) react well to antibiotics and are of easy treatment.
Nevertheless, once it is applied exaggerated or illegally to the antibiotics, the bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, transform themselves into very resistant bacteria to antibiotics and infect quickly in inadequate hospitable conditions.
They can cause serious hospitable infections, for example wounded infections of or septicemia in the first place to the patients with transitory or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the debilitated organism, old or people of little weight.
In opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing no special in the infection of the MRSA, these infections are daily in the hospitals.
The infection with the epidemic is not due to confuse, the MRSA is only absent - Tibor Nyulasi said - where is not examined its presence.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the infirmary personnel takes care of in gloves of rubber and mask to them and exist antibiotics adapted for its treatment" - Tibor Nyulasi said.
The hospitalized patients are examined previously to verify the presence of the MRSA in their organism, but not even therefore the infection in all the cases can be avoided.
He is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent the hospitable infections with the MRSA in most of the cases, nevertheless the present national hospitable circumstances do not favor for the prevention of the formation and I infect with the multiresistant pathogenic agents - Karolina Böröcz affirms.
As this infection fundamentally takes place in hospitals and homes of old, the hospitals would have to examine the hospitalized patients and to isolate immediately to you sicken them that they take in its organism the MRSA.
Nevertheless, in the Hungarian hospitals the taking of microbiological samples is not fashionable.
This fact also must to that the National Box of Health does not finance these medical examinations.
So that most of the cases they come to the public light when they take place already the infections of the visible MRSA in the patient - epidemiologist said to the medical-female leader of department of the center.
The European Union makes rigorous charges for the application of antibiotics in the human medicine and also exist national directors to treat the pathological infections and pictures.
It is necessary to empenar itself in which the therapy with antibiotic is directed, that is, would be due to make examinations microbiological to prevent that resistance medicines takes place in front of, but the hospitals not always fulfill this exigency.
The taking of microbiological samples is still less frequent in the case of the traveling patients or in the basic attendance - Karolina Böröcz affirmed.
It is saved with disinfectants
The scientific experiments have demonstrated that in most of the cases the MRSA it is infected from a patient to another one through the sanitary personnel.
Therefore, they desempenan a very important paper the washing of the hands, the use of gloves of rubber and masks, nevertheless also in this sense experience considerable lack in the hospitals.
The MRSA infects by means of the transmission by drops and the direct bonding between people, nevertheless in the national hospitable circumstances not always is possible to isolate the infected patient.
He is more, the rooms of the hospitals frequently are finessed, the beds often are very together, although to prevent the epidemic, the patients would have to be in favor separated at least of a distance of 1,5 meters.
Lamentably it is possible also to be experimented - Karolina Böröcz added - that in the hospitals of less favorable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, are few nurses and many patients and for that reason there is a greater probability for the infection.
In opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where the suitable measures of prevention are fulfilled, less infections of this type are registered or it is possible to be stopped I infect of the pathogenic agent.
Governmental program against the MRSA
The treatment of I infect with MRSA is an enormous cost for the National Bottom of Insurance of Disease, reason why in all the countries it is fought against him.
In England for example a governmental program exists to prevent and to reduce the cases of the MRSA.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the provided data, the infections with MRSA show tendency of diminution in England.
The European Center for the Prevention and the Control of Enfermedades (ECDC) has between its priorities the prevention of the multiresistant agents (between these the MRSA) and the one of the hospitable infections that must to these pathogenic agents.

Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the UE
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all Europe goes towards that Balkan country before little mentioned.
What thing, where and who they buy in the still more cheap market of the UE, that will increase in price quickly?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The objective preferred for the real estate acquisitions in East Europe is without a doubt some Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments of the tracks of ski and the villa of beaches.
The montanosas regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the favourites more, whereas in the beaches Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Coast of the Sun", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people look for buildings also in the environs of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central zone of the country - like Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will wake up the interest of the real estate promoters and more and more people will buy buildings in the specially cheap zone of Rus.
Equally the Sofía capital could be attractive, the commercial spaces and of offices they promise a fast recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is in the best way to also become one of the most attractive paradises of golf of Europe, being able to be therefore an outstanding destiny during the other two stations, in addition to the summer and the winter.
Therefore, the cautious investors already are making their purchases, for example in the environs of Bansko.
In opinion of the analysts, those that buy buildings in Bulgaria, also make an effort to change to their life and its way to live.
Most of the clients they are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Espana and more and more of Rumania.
Also the malteses promoters are present and chipriotas and traditionally are many Russian clients in beaches of the Black Sea and the paradises of ski.
The foreign clients can classify themselves in three groups - Georgi Jankov says, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those that they try to settle here buy buildings new or renewed by a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in badly been between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them soon.
They demand good communication and access, in addition for them it has importance the proximity of a great city, the stores and generally of a local doctor.
The buyers of villas constitute the second category (Bulgaria in the month of December was including between the first 10 vacacionales destinies of the Germans).
The real estate investors constitute the third group who make their purchases with the hope benefit to medium or long term.
The price of the capital buildings goes in constant growth, since the demand is every greater time.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria it has the lower real estate prices, in the last five anuses these underwent an annual increase of the 21 percent
The increase of the price of the buildings considerably surpasses the growth of the wages.
Fodor and the six by Hungarian hundreds
According to Minister de Medio.ambiente informed and Hidrologi'a Gábor Fodor the encounter at level of experts will be finished Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue the negotiations at level of ministers on the later international climatic regime to 2012.
The experts and politicians coming from 192 countries of the world deliberate on the Trip ticket of Balí that arranges on the later efforts to the period of reduction of emissions, established in the Protocol of Kyoto, effective until 2012.
At the present time they are carried out animated to discussions on the individual between the developing countries and the industrialized ones.
The United States already has indicated that at the moment it does not wish to negotiate on precise numbers, although tends to reach the agreement in which in comparison with the 1990 situation, until anus 2020 the emission of responsible gases by the effect diminishes with 25 to a 40 percent conservatory.
Another great subject of the conference is that if the industrialized countries, besides to reduce the emissions, or are not arranged to offer material and technological aid to the countries that need it.
One reached an agreement in addition on the aids to offer to the developing countries.
The bottom of support, anticipated in the Protocol of Kyoto, will be directed by an advice of direction integrated by 16 members, probably within the Global Bottom for the Medio.ambiente of the UN (GEF) - és Profit writes the "Piac".
The six by hundreds of Hungary
In name of Hungary, Minister de Medio.ambiente and Hidrologi'a Gábor Fodor support the efforts of the UE to conserve his paper of vanguard in the global protection of the climate and to promote the company/signature in the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister declared independently that the UE is committed to reduce until 2020, with respect to the level of 1990 in a 20 percent his gas discharges, person in charge by the effect conservatory, if the "later agreement to 2012" is signed or and is not arranged to commit itself in even diminishing a 30 percent if the other great developed regions of the world and the developing countries also are arranged to assume commitments as with their responsibility and its capacities.
Gábor Fodor pointed that the signatory countries of the Protocol of Kyoto of 1997 were committed to diminish in a 5.2 percent, within this then the 15 States members of the UE were committed in fulfilling an 8 percent of diminution.
The commitment of Hungary is to diminish with a 6 percent the responsible gas discharge by the effect conservatory with respect to the period between 1985 and 87, that our country will fulfill - senala the official notice of press of the Ministry of Medio.ambiente.
It is much what is in game in Balí, since within two anuses will be necessary in the long term to sign the international agreement of the climatic policy, because if no, he is safe that its take effect would be postponed stops after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the Protocol of Kyoto would not be followed immediately by a new international system of reduction of emissions, whose necessity was noticed in his more recent report by the IPCC, international scientific association of the UN that takes care with the climatic change, that obtained the Nobel prize of La Paz.
With it, the reduction of the emissions would undergo a delay and an increase of more could not be prevented of ò C of the average temperature of the Earth, fact that according to the scientists would have incommensurable and irreversible consequences.
I exercise British recruit in YouTube
The units of I exercise British in a distributor of videos publish recordings on actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize to themselves.
The first British Air Force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of the services of YouTube: the moved special units in Afghanistan from the March of 2006 are loading videos on their actions against talibanes - the BBC informed.
These recordings done with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in the general body of operations of Kandahar, soon are sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Or they are the 139 recordings coming from the soldiers of the Air Force who have been loaded of this form to the Internet and its "channel" has been seen or by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and as much publishes videos of actions perpetrated in Iraq like in Afghanistan, meanwhile the Ministry of the Community of British Nations (the Commonwealth Office) as the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the Air Force had loaded the videos with recruitment objectives, but in opinion of the Ministry of Defense they also serve to present/display to the public the true objective to him of the presence of I exercise British in the outside.
This type of propaganda practically does not cost anything in comparison with spots televising conventional of recruitment - the expert in defense Gordon Mackenzie declared to the BBC - in change, inevitably have some political message, put that in a specific form justifies the reason of being of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared videojuego
I exercise also worries about the fact that, in addition to published and the distrustfully censured recordings, in the distributor become fond of videos also appear, for example on the death of the soldiers: in "the official" films of propaganda, a little hypocritical, the officials speak at the most of losses, without nevertheless presenting/displaying the bloody part of the combats.
In addition, of the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan numerous videos recorded in real operations have been loaded to the Internet already, but I exercise lately British single is taking advantage of this opportunity.
The Americans gratuitously use a form a little different for the recruitment with the descargables videojuegos from denominated firings Americás Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can put itself directly instead of the soldiers.
Salty Tómbola and pastelillo in the celebration of Christmas of the ministries

However, the Secretary of Labor Mónika Lamperth does not hope to her colleagues for a navidena official celebration, but for a meeting of work of anus aim.
It is counted on the participation of one hundred eighty guests who - as the department informed into press - will take so single salty coffee and pastelillo, reason why the celebration will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai however simply will offer his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for the Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finanzas (MF) will celebrate a navidena celebration in its own assembly hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The navidena celebration will have a budget of 2500 HUF by guest - of this budget a toast will be paid to the reception with buffet and.
Ever since János Veres is the minister, the workers of the MF all the anuses celebrate of the same form Christmas.

The agriculture portfolio will offer a reception of New Anus the 20 of January, in the Ministry will not be celebrated Christmas.
The reception will be celebrated in the Castle of Vajdahunyad of the Municipal Park and according to it communicated the portfolio, will be a budget of 1000 HUF by person for the one hundred guests.

However, if the law is approved, the strike commissions will meet and will decide on the future.
In base of the order of the day of Monday of the National Assembly also it is possible that one only vows on the law of public health in the hours very entered at night, or perhaps near the midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin Monday, it will be necessary to count on significant difficulties in the transport: in the railroads it will be let work per indefinite time, by the manana it can that stops a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurban transport of buses of companías Volán.
Simultaneously, in numerous points of the country there will be closing of half of the routes of the highways.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have adhered to strike, their names constantly update in the page Web of Liga.
Some unions announced their strike per indefinite time, others per defined time.
Until afternoon from Thursday the State Railroad and the Free Union of Trabajadores Ferroviarios (SLTF) they could not reach an agreement so at least nor on the minimum services, although, when coming near the celebrations of Christmas, every time are the more the people who travel in the trains.
According to information received until now, from the beginning of the day to the 13 hours they will be in strike the workers of the Company of Collective Transport of Budapest, those of Budapest Airport from the 7 to the 9 of the manana, will celebrate a strike of four hours the Unions of LEAGUE of the Electrical Industry and of Thermal Energy, the Unions of the Educators called to a 2 strike of and the Democratic Union of the Educators of 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will be pronounced in national strike in alternative schedules and the Democratic Union of the Workers of the Sector of the Health and Social (SDTSSS) who comprise of the Forum of Union Cooperation, will celebrate a strike of warning of two hours.
Most important of the four demands formulated by Liga it is that the government retires his proposal relative to the reform of the public health and puts under a new conception a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of the pensions that will take effect the anus that comes.
Third it is that they assure, even before 2010, for the case of the advanced pensions the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for strike is that the Free Union of Trabajadores Ferroviarios (SLTF) that is part of the Unions of League, they do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway lateral lines and wait for another different proposal.
Capital Political: In the country the risk by the Hungarian Guard is increased
According to the Division of Analysis of Risks (Risk Analysing Division) of the Capital Political the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in the month of August of this anus with the support of the Movement by Better Hungary, from several points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the "warning on risks" of companía it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greater political risk constitutes the fact that "with the agravamiento of the existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and nongypsy population of Hungary, in the short term violent ethnic confrontations will even be able to take place".
The main reason for it is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard probably is the provocation of an event of this one character - the representative of the institute of investigations added.
They affirmed that all it must to one of the main lack of the protagonists of the Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of the public life yielded the public debate to him of the gypsy problem to the representatives of the radical and extremist political groupings, that could base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between Hungarian gypsys and".
This aggravates the problem, disables the normal dialogue, fortifies the extremists and increases the probability of the outbreak of the violent conflicts - they consider.
In addition to that, according to the institute of investigations, the activity of the National Guard, by consequence of the great attention of the average international national and, "it significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary in the outside, mainly in which one talks about to the stability and the democratic development of the country".
They remember to us that: from otono of 2006 it received every time greater publicity and impulse the reorganization of the radical groups and extreme right of Hungary and who from the summer of 2007 have constituted in the country numerous organizations who are autodefinen of "associations of national self-defense".
"the common characteristic of these groupings is that they are autodefinen like civil organizations, whereas they openly proclaim the training of its members for the defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of the public order), alluding to ineptitudes of the police, of I exercise, is to say of the State" - they add.
They affirmed: all it takes place in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation him to different political aspirations, being based on the displeasure of the society with the policy and the political parties.
Then to emphasize the civilian and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of the legal inscription, but it is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of the vicinity relations.
"In the last months, in numerous neighboring States talked about to the Hungarian Guard like a a potential danger, whereas the ultranationalist political figures of certain neighboring countries, want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region "- they added.
According to the institute of investigations, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in the Center and This of Europe, so that in all the region the political risks were increased.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in similar form that for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in the month of August of 2007 by Unio'n Bulgarian Nacional (UNB) of extreme right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard must to the massive disturbances of the gypsys who took place in one of the districts of Sofía (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument of which the objective of the organization is "the national self-defense".
In their opinion, in the last 17 anuses were "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, nevertheless the State remained impotent and indifferent front to the facts - the Capital Political remembers.
They added: this initiative has caused one animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, the one indicates the increase of the risk of the ethnic confrontations that certain gypsy organizations of Bulgaria have announced that stops to resist, will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard until now has shown similarities with the one of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not possible to be excluded that also the gypsys of Hungary react to the threat in similar form, organizing its own self-defense - it can be ***reflxed mng in the warning on the risks of the Capital Political.
The director of investigations of the Capital Political, Attila Juhász to the question of the agency of the news affirmed: the analysis of risks is one of the activities of the institute of investigations.
As it said, each anus analyses publish his of risks and when they experience something that can influence in the change of the risk, inform to the public opinion, as it happened in this case, publishing its warning on the risks.
The celebration not always is written with red numbers
In Hungary the law accurately defines the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and it has already become a generalized practice that around the holidays - that the anus that comes will be less - reorganizes the labor days.
Not even in the UE or North America the celebrations are unitary.
The Hungarian laws make a difference between national celebration, festive celebration of State and days.
The festive days fundamentally are related to religious celebrations and historical events.
Festejamos the New Anus also: as much the last day of the old anus, like the first day of the new anus last one is festive - this one mainly so that those can rest that happened festejando the old anus.
Throughout the anus we have eleven celebrations written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is national celebration the 15 of March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and the 23 of October, commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
The 20 of August we celebrated the foundation of the State, 1o of May the celebration of the work, 1o and ò of November we remembered to our relatives and passed away friends.
In addition, in our country they are celebrations of two days Passover de Resurreccio'n, the Pentecostés and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious celebrations not very often agree with a weekend, for that reason frequently bridge when before or after the celebration is made is a single labor day.
In exchange for the week ends extended thus, during previous Saturdays it is not possible to be absented of the work or the school.
He is the Secretary of Labor that it regulates in its specific decree when there is to work exactly in exchange for the preceding or directly later day to the celebration.
This legal norm is of obligatory fulfillment for all the patronos and their employees, as well as for the employees and officials government.
It is not obligatory however for the companies and institutions of services that, due to their function, work uninterruptedly even during the festive days.
This anus the work order will be able to be altered solely around the celebrations of the anus aim: from the 24 of December the life in the country practically stops, since according to the experiences, most of people "it makes bridge" during the days between Christmas and the aim of the anus or take his vacations during these days.
The next anus several of our celebrations will agree with half-full or week ends, reason why there will be less changes in the labor days that this anus.
First the agenda around the celebration of the work will be modified so that soon, during four days successive, the workers can rest.
Saturday, 26 of April will be labor day, so that in return Friday 2 of May is festive day.
The other change is related to the celebration of the 23 of October: Saturday 18 of October, will be necessary to work instead of Friday 24.
However, the anus that comes during the celebration of anus aim will be able to rest, since from the 24 of December will not work in almost no part, nor although the last day of the anus is Wednesday.

You lose interest if you want to fulfill the expectations of the public
The car advances slowly in the habitual clogging of the manana.
It sounds a extrano compass in the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I raise the volume.
It changes the rate of music and to the previous tones the voice of a feminine choir is added soon low and as a true jewel takes part.
The channel mr2 reproduces the Wings song of Love de Zagar.
The national musical life not us malcrió much with pop electronic of quality.
But now it seems totally different east clogging when you are listening to the new disc of Zagar.
It appears Yonderboi. Some new and interesting songs of underground digital national little by little are changing the image and although he is fashionable the rock style garage, breaks guitars again, electro pop national has demonstrated: there are new features under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer initiated its race in the city of Pécs, touched in the set of Yonderboi perhaps until it initiated his independent race because both cannot be protagonists of a same set.
With its project (Zagar) and its music, a mixture of jazz, danceable and pop electronic music, tried to prevail, when they requested soundtracks to him cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The amplest public knew the set that at first acted single in pequenos clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first disc published in 2002 between fifty more important national discs, classifying to Zagar, along with Yonderboi like almost the only training national of tendencies, able to be sold also in the western markets.
It does not fit doubts that Zagar and its set are fashionable, but nobody has asked to them if they take or not with pleasure this label.
The set reacted as it must react: it prepared a new disc still better and.
The disc just sent, titleholder Cannot Walk Fly Instead will be able to lay new ways for them, although the own title tries to establish the continuity with the initial anuses in the city of Pécs.
Then this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
It is the reference well on the windy thing, on the flight, but in addition to the windy thing of music, now it appeared - according to the spirit and the tendency of the time - the guitar that sounds more fort, the effect of the rock and roll.
With these songs it presented/displayed the disc in the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who at the moment works in England with the set The Puzzle.
In the disc a true success of the channel is included mr2 Petõfi that lately transmits of the manana to the night pop music. This transmitter took until the ears of the radioyentes the music of high flight of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (# $$ivas>Underground").
Then everything is in order ().
hvg.hu asked to him Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one that you are interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select public?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select public for me means little.
In my opinion two types of chaste exist in slight music; not mainstream and underground, nonalternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also thus the call underground alternative music can be boring, without sense and can be composed equally single for the sale, which makes commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works with this spirit, independently of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: You see some difference between the welcome of your music on the part of the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: Abroad, mainly to the West of us, slight music has greater traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty anuses frequent the concerts, but also oldest.
They much more pay attention to the changes that take place around in his in slight music, because they consider part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What function has the public in your work?
It matters to you who are, from where are and how many they are the people who listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel well when seeing that every time attends more people our concerts.
But never we have composed music for the market.
We do not compose music by some objective, but by some reason.
The paper of the public rather feels in the concerts where a reciprocal influence exists, but this is solely in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And nevertheless, I realized of which if you want to fulfill the expectations of the public, you lose its interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent you try to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works in solitaire and rather made his race to the West of us.
B.Zs: We did not follow their way, although sometimes they try to compare our music with the one of him.
We rather worked in equipment, trusted the musical presence of the other and left develops.
At first he was inevitable that compares our works with the music of Yonderboi, since many of us we initiated our race in its group and of we undertook another way there.
hvg.hu: In the list of successes of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Much people listened to for the first time the name of Zagar in relation to this song.
You opened conscientiously with this style towards one more a ampler layer?
Zs.B.: We did not try to compose great successes and to sell with these successes our disc.
This song is something more than that.
We added it at the end of the disc, treating to relax after orgía sonorous of the disc and the heaviest subjects.
hvg.hu: How you have selected the six singers?
Why exactly to them - which was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea went to create a choir to the style gospel.
Then the idea came to create this choir of the solistas of good voice of our own national musical scene.
Thus that choir of six women was created - that is the Seine, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [ Neon ] and Juci Németh - that soon was baptized like Divas de Underground.
hvg.hu: You composed exactly therefore the song or the girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed long ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material of the disc, we still thought that lack something.
The agreed one attracted the song.
Still that night I recorded the song that later the girls learned.
Everything practically arrived at the first attempt and in incredibly spontaneous form.
I remember to me, excited to me very many then, but naturally the Divas needed also.
With my voice it had not worked with as much force.
hvg.hu: As much in the concert as in the disc it seems as if the girls were in background.
There are no solistas (except brief the single one of Judy Jay), they do not have own paper, they sing all meetings not more strongly and than music, reason why music not only acompana its songs.
Also in the scene they are located at heart.
Deliberately?
B.Zs: They are in favor at heart simply of technical problems.
However consciously we did not want to distribute papers of solistas.
The song also turns on it, on which we forget our ego awhile, the one that who from where it has come and to where it goes, we leave since those wings, the wings of the love raise to us.
It had wanted to obtain that also others felt that one euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: To which you dedicated more work?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition in fact to no, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I am touching in to a concert piano of or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where during long short while did not want to work groove soon and, little by little everything was put to its place like in puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your song preferred in the new disc?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because "I have already loosen" the disc.
Now the Prophet Is To Fool, Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A traicionero stockbroker risks thousands of million by its inferiority complex
A disloyal malversador.
Thus it is as it indicates to its old employee, Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Générale, owner also of the Czech Commercial bank.
By him it lost near five billion euros.
Nevertheless, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player whom it loved to compare itself to his colleagues and, without a doubt, with good capacities.
It intuited a long time ago, unlike all the great Czech banks, the crisis in the American market of mortgages.
"It has a fragile character" was let oir of its superior ones, such that they sent to him to the police.
But what it is come off the answers of Kerviel according to which the French mass media traslucen, as the newspaper Cleans to Him, is that was a man who at the end of the last year had a gain of more than 1,600 million euros thanks to his businesses.
Crisis not only in America
"Everything what I wanted to do was to make money for my bank" assures in its answers.
Indeed, in summer, it was able to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity already vió to come at the beginning of year.
In February they began to listen to some news on the calls mortgages sub-prioritizes offered to clients of low income or to which in the past they had problems with the payments and of that those clients would begin to have problems.
Nevertheless, this crisis did not have to influence in all the economy.
Kerviel was not believed it and bet correctly.
And later, to end of the year their gains surpassed the 1,600 million euros.
"When I already gained my first 500 million I did not know as to notify it" Kerviel confesses and adds, that has not left anything for he himself, absolutely.
Throughout the interrogation declared that it had falseado the registries in such a way that was not arrived at its discovery.
It even got to deceive the heads, even though Eurex stock-market began to be interested in its businesses.
The risk became benefit
It feared that it was gotten to discover?
Rather, no.
"I thought that it had gained 1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would cheer to them."
From where it removed as much force of will to risk that way?
In my position one was due to work gradually.
It entered to work in Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing studying in Lyon.
Its annual pay was handled between the 51,000 dolares.
Two years later already he was attending of stockbroker and year 2005 dolares became stockbroker with 90,000 an annual pay of.
Even so it knew that never it was going to gain so much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005 already I observed that they watched to me with caution.
Due to my formation and also to my professional and personal progress "it described Kerviel to the investigators.
But soon after my entrance in the company the first great success arrived.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing the loss a title of 500 million euros.
And this supposed a starting mechanism, and wanted more.
If it is that desire, we left you
"This is as a snow ball" said the police.
But one says that the heads knew of all this or that rather they suspected it.
"While it made money, they closed the eyes."
Only that, later, arrived the blow at the beginning of this year.
In a day it lost billion euros.
After the weekend to half of January it wanted to erase all track.
When Monday arrived at the work, no longer it worked in the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that there were lost 5,000 million euros by his fault.
And how they were able to locate to him?
It happened to be suspicious as of its vacations.
"I chose only four days by the passed year.
The runner who does not have vacations is a runner who does not want that nobody throws a glance to him to its file "finished Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of obtaining 365 billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programs of which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
One is practicamente half of the extreme total that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for years 2007 to 2013.
Seven operational programs they will approximately leave about 125 billion crowns for the regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns of the Program Company and Innovation.
Most of the money will go destined to the transport, up to 150 billion.
The Program of Transport is the greater one of the operational programs and represents until a 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain of the bottom.
This money increases the budget of the state bottom for railway and highway networks that the next year will count with the amount of 90,800 million crowns.
The program of Company and Innovation must serve to the industralists and companies for the obtaining as resources in the innovation as the businesses.
The companies would have to obtain financing for the acquisition of new technologies, the industrial investigation and the implementation of organizational methods more cash.
In which one talks about the present use of the bottoms of the UE, the Czech Republic is between paises they recien entered that except uses them.
Pain of twenty years for the ex-president of Nicaragua, decreed the court
The Court of Appeals of Nicaragua decreed to Thursday the pain of 20 years for the ex-president of pais, German Arnaldo, which was condemned in 2003 by the embezzlement of 100 billion dollars (almost 1,800 million crowns).
In spite of it, a time despues, was released of the jail to happen to house arrest in its property not far from metrópili Nicaraguan.
He is not nothing clear at the moment, according to the agency AP of which, the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, returns to be between grates.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Perez, it will depend rather on the penitentiary agents if they let to German finish its punishment in house or if they make it return to the prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated as German constantly transferred money from the government to the account of a company in Pánama.
This society was fictitious and the account belonged, in fact, to its relatives and those in favor more cercanosT.
Part of this money finished at heart that German it created to finance his campaign in the elections of year 2001.
To thus they approved the budget us
Thus it is.
The Budget of State was approved.
Why it is special estimated east?
First it is elaborated by this government and accepted by most of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget of this year already was approved with the?SSD support, because it prepared minister Sobotka and?SSD could not be allowed not to accept it.
Aside from different debates before the voting on the vote from confidence from the government, this time, did not happen anything dramatic.
The parliamentary assembly, in the this traditional Vista although most influential, approved with tranquillity the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Each government begins and finishes with each chapter and game of the budget, they like or no.
The budget is an important part of the policy but in him the rivalry of being able between the government and the opposition hides.
It is important for means of comunicacón and for that reason they dedicate a special attention to him.
The political discussions are much more interesting that the simple numbers.
The Budgets of the State of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered of three defects that east year of 2008 stops is not possible to solve so facilmente:
First of them it is the participation discharge of the obligatory laws, call like of expenses of the agent chief executives who are not only the pensions but also the social benefits that already the last year were approved before the elections by "quiet" the coalition of?SSD and KS?M.
Second of them it is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of the public financing, like the municipal and communitarian budgetary deficit.
In spite of it, the greater risk is not in the deficit of the Budget of the State.
This one is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, nevertheless, is in the deficit of the municipal and communitarian budget.
Many mayors to be able to obtain other sources of investment, aside from the money of the taxes, rates and credits of the banks, often emitted, without sense, obligations with which became indebted very out of proportion to their city councils.
In the last years were able to pay these debts by means of the massive sale of power actions and other networks of development that received from the state and the privatization.
At the moment they do not count on this resource.
If we rely only on the official facts and verified, we discovered that:
Our economy, already for years, has been happening through phases of growth of the same form like the rest of the world, of which?SSD is boasted.
This was the ideal occasion so that his government put order to the finances of the State.
Nevertheless, instead of it the state continued becoming indebted itself.
The rest of paises, excepting some like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably that our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, mainly, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within the global measures less we are threatened by the poverty.
For that reason the social massive programs are not necessary that, unfortunately, in the last years inutilmente were swollen with gigantic measures.
And although they were able to eliminate part of the incomprehensible expenses Populists approved this year before the elections, if shortly it does not change the age of retirement and the reform of the then pensions is the end really of any policy in this pais and, governs that only governs will be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians who govern will transform into mechanical civil employees, distributors of most of the money of the taxes for the retirement and the social benefits.
For that reason, the budget of this year cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the expenses of the agent chief executives.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for year 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the last government had not squandered ten years in the last which could.
Not quisieramos that the politicians who govern become only civil employees for that reason we must be patient and to grant to this weak coalition of the government, who realizes of which the state only can spend what is able to obtain from the taxes and the rates, the tranquillity for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will make possible the gradual profit of an Estimated balance of the State.

The Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central bank and the Central banks British, Swiss and Canadian decided to fight together against the crisis of the Market of finances.
In the monetary Marked one it will be received more than one hundred billion dollars by means of licitaciónes.
In these licitations the banks auction the types of interest by which they are able to lend money.
For example, the Fed American will send to bid on forty billion dollars, and later other twenty-four billion will facilitate the central banks of Swiss Europe and.
After the attacks of the 11 of September, it is the first time that central banks of different states are agreed in this coordinated process to protect and to diminish the consequences of the crisis of finances.
"This step must solve the greater economic problem, that is to say, the continuous growth of the shortage of free capital that the banks could render" wrote in its report for the clients, Bernard Baumohl of the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action of the central banks probably diminished the recession in the United States of a 65 percent to a fifty percent" added Baumohl in its report.
The banks already have spent sixty billion dollars in credits pending payment, mainly in the United States.
The economists still wait for thousands of million in losses.
"the central banks must really have fear to which it still waits for to them when they decided to take this step" said the main economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems to be that the situation is really bad" added.
The central banks fear that they such have problems of access to the loans and that for that reason they will have to lend more expensive his clients.
This would reduce the consumption and would send to the American economy to the recession with different impacts in the growth of economóa world-wide.
The central banks thus decided, after they were not able to reduce the call prices LIBOR, quarrels interbank London that are used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that the banks constantly feared to even lend money when the Central banks of the U.S.A., Canada and Gran Britain reduced during the autumn their types of interest several times.
"It will have the same effect as another fall of the types of interest" said to Reuters agency, Greg Salvaggio of the company Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised of which the step taken by the central banks contributes to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that she is the caida one of the real estate market in the U.S.A..
Klaus: The debates of the ecologists are incredible
The climatic global change mainly affects paises developing.
President Václav Klaus expressed itself again with respect to the problematic one of the global heating.
The critic arose now with the closing of the international conference of the UN on the climatic change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where it presented/displayed his Azúl book, green nonplanet, commented that the debates of the ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus he is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that a strange mixture of government representatives creates and of nongovernmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric who are used and the reality.
"There the debates as soon as they are structured, are fireworks of words, substitutes of the solution to the present problems" said Klaus.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book emphasized that this subject is for very important him and that for that reason is interested.
It also expressed its joy to discover its book translated to the German because as it often said "only I find with the cartoon of my ideas".
Now the interested ones can inquire on their many-colored opinions.
Klaus remembered that he is not a climatologist but who has, according to its opinion, sufficient supposed as to write a book like this one.
He is academic, with capacity to follow and to judge a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also economist.
In moment main of closing expressed his thought of that climate changes constantly and that his changes are normal, that on the heating of the planet an agreement between the scientists does not exist, who the consequences of the present changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters and that the attempts to influence in the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and expensive unacceptable.
In addition as man experienced with the totalitarianisms considers like unacceptable imposing the nonproven opinions to others, which feels as a dangerous form to limit the freedom of the others.
To the questions of the presents it explained repeatedly that it is not in against "of the reasonable defenders of the medio.ambiente but against the ecological militants who do not take in consideration the relation between costs and benefits".
Of the same subject Klaus in Vienna two months ago in the Hayek Institute spoke already.
600 thousand people did not reach to change their membership card to lead
To six hundreds thousand conductors the date went to them and for that reason they did not reach to change its old membership card to lead whose validity finishes to end of year.
Today it is the last day when people can ask for the change so that the time civil employees them until end of year in emitting the new membership card.
Nevertheless, the Ministry does not fear that after New Year they are by the wagon hundreds of thousands of conductors without the valid membership card.
According to traffic, the membership card has not changed mainly those to it that already not even they want to lead.
Whereas in the towns they announce a fast reduction of the change of membership cards, the offices of the metropolis estan full of requests and the interest by the new membership card has increased.
The City council calculates around 2,000 daily clients.
In the tails it is expected half an hour.
In the Prague they have still not removed the new membership card around 140,000 conductors.
The emission of a new membership card lasts twenty days.
Nevertheless, it is possible to request the emission of the membership card in a shorter term of five days.
But in that case the conductor must pay five hundred crowns.
The conductors who obligatorily must change their membership card and do not reach to end of year, but they will leave to the highways without the valid membership card will risk to a fine as of January.
The violator will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the infraction with a reprimand.
In case of being an administrative infraction the fine will ascend to 2,500 crowns.
According to the previous information that person could receive a fine who does not go nowhere.
They could pay presumably up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed at the most to the offices so that fines of thousand crowns entered moderately.
According to the vowel of the ministry of transports, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of thousand crowns do not threaten anybody.
According to him, the membership card to lead is a document in which people can decide if they want it or no.
It is not the identity membership card that each person must have valid.
The people whom they do not love to lead would have to give the membership card to lead.
It is enough with bringing it or sending it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
To end of year they stop being valid the membership cards emitted during years 1964 and 1993.
Nevertheless, the conductors will have little by little to be changing the other types of membership card to lead.

The validity of the membership card that was emitted between years 2001 and 2004 finishes in December of 2013.
According to Hanzelka one is about 2.6 million documents more.

Berdych is also in this accused case but to him it waits for in the first place the verdict to him of the Court of first instance.

Most of the accusations of the defendant they were rejected by the investigation to be invented causes.

For each one of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and by the children, a million.
The hospital offers 200,000 by each father at the most.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond?ej Dostál is not in principle in agreement with the proposal of Veleba.
"Such demand we did not approve it, is too high" said Dostál after the today meeting.
"So that we pruned ourselves to make an idea of this counterproposal, we needed the report the specialist who contraparte commanded to investigate.
We will find out if rescisorio has a value.
We stay in the opinion that they will be hundreds of thousands for all "emphasized Dostál.
The amount would have to move between the 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each one of the parents.
At the beginning of the cause, the family of Jablo? it wanted, for every month which they did not raise to its biological daughter, a million crowns.
It guarded used as it bases to negotiate the indemnification of the report of the specialist, only who this one was elaborated in the hospital of the faculty of Motol in the Prague.
The parents of the children according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry underwent of psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation better was supported by the men although they were fought with recriminaciones by the change of the children.
The women worse take it with the trauma than they are living at the moment and with respect to which she happens today, she completed Veleba.
Verónica and Nicola were changed by the nurses in the House of maternity of T?ebi? the year pasadp, the nine of December.
The last week, the children returned to their biological parents, Nicola to?ermákový to P?ibyslavic, and Verónica to Libor Bro? and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo.
The governor of Vyso?ina, Milo? Vystr?il, gave at the end of October to each family 100,000 crowns like expenses of compensation by the error committed in the hospital of T?ebi? that the region administers.
All the hospitals of the Czech Republic are assured by law like responsibilities by damages.
In case of errors they must extract of the reserve fund and extraordinarily they can request aid to the administrator.
The court until today recognized a proportionally low indemnification to them, the sums that calculated estraordinariamente according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and of a million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit on the mark Kingdom of Valaquia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava it was first that used the mark Kingdom of Valaquia but the project was created during many years by Tomá? Harabi? with who the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear today at sight oral.
According to its lawyer the cause has probably not finished and his client will resort.
"the lawsuit consists of which Mr. Harabi? and their equipment is parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka "said after the process, the lawyer of Polívka.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Valaquia, to everybody the image comes to him from the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabi.
"We had been after us about ten years of work.
Search of money and invention of activities "said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have occurred to account of that the project is successful and that for that reason also could receive something.
They want to live as parasitic on our work "added.
A lucrative business
According to the court the mark Kingdom of Valaquia was used first by Polívka in its program of television.
In 1993 it was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then one was not to orient it towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
Some years later to Harabi? it was happened to him to publish the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
As of that humorous origin it was a business and a lucrative enterprise activity of which Harabi? the society created later Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed in the use of its signature block in the passports and even offered to its possessors discounts to the vistantes of its farm and assistants to its spectacles.
Who will seat in the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabi? she only used a simple idea that Polívka made public in the scene for its own enterprise benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia" said the judge.
It added nevertheless that in the spirit of the project it is Harabi? and its equipment which was dedicated completely to it.
The collaboration, between the today disturbed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabi? it organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment began to occur conflicts between Polívka and Harabi? whose culmination arrived with the overthrow of "king Boleslav I, the chosen one by always".
The main paper in the kingdom, through Harabi? it derived in the Jarmila singer?uláková, as mother reigns.
In 2002, Polívka presented/displayed an accusation against Harabi? and its society that until today has been rejected by the court.
Something in clear could bring in the litigation, the match by the throne with its princess, whom already Harabi is preparing.
Him the new king would have to leave.
It has not wanted to keep awake still more data nor dates.
"we are not in a any hurry.
It would have to be something like the way of the king towards Moravia.
The king would have to be chosen in a concrete date.
Mr. Polívka even can appear "added Harabi.
Peugeot Test 207 1,6 SW VTi: surpassed prejudices
To tell the truth never I have liked too much Peugeotu 206.
Their characteristics of march never were nothing special, the quality of the gear box, maneuvers and also the product could be characterized like below the average.
But now his successor, Peugeot 207 exists in the market, and this one, is far better.
This called Combi SW is a little more advanced and to me, already only I have left to think to me it better.
When I proved the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, it complained to me, for example, of the space of the head in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I am not going to suffer both before meters of length.
Flying by the world
Passage by the interior quickly not to repeat it too much.
One is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here it would value plus the design invention although already the car seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there they are left the times in which we complained short seats and endorsements.
Also unlike model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And the space, and here it is possible to be felt how the measures of the body have grown.
In the Combi the mentioned shortage of space in the head disappears.
Suitcases to the maletero
But the main thing in this vehicle is its maletero.
This I must value it like very accessible (thanks to the folding back inner door) and a distributed affluent storage.
The dead arounds estan equipped with rubber strap that suppose an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and they are possible to be extended until the point to hold heavy objects.
But quedémonos in the deposit.
According to the tables, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which in comparison with the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same sold type more in the Czech Republic?koda Fabia Combi.
If we compared the 207 SW with the new generation of the model of Mladá Boleslav, we found out that the Peugeot remains to the rear with its perceivable 52 liters.
Of vacations to the foreigner or placing the small car of the boy its value is critical.
But if it had to comment something positive then I must mention the floor that is left enough plane after lowering the endorsements of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Automovil made a will ours it was equipped with encedido of injection of four valves on a capacity of 1.6 l.s and one 88 force of kW.
And to tell the truth thus it is like would have to seem a 1600 that it despised to the relative five doors.
He is quiet, it consumes little and mainly, it has impulse.
If I compare it with the time of?koda of then that seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this one I can be made an impression.
The prices respond
The price of the automobile is not for all the pockets.
We must, nevertheless, have in account that we have made a will a vehicle elegant equipped and with a very good motor.
The basic price of the car with ignition of injection of 1400 by 329,900 crowns, still can.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which already is too much.
The Premium type made a will already reaches other 80,000 crowns.
Only that tendriamos still airbag in the heads, conditioned air automatic, automatic windshield wiper, automated back windows...
That is to say, the car yet of everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It is much, but it counts on the complements of the equipment in the Fabia and will arrive at a quite similar number.
Now already only it is to be decided by as of the two marks.
The Slovakian students do not integrate themselves in the English schools
In the English schools they attend children of paises of the east of Europe and for that reason, the villagers fear more changes in the schools.
The integration of the European of the east so far only brings a series of problems.
The British schools even register those cases where the conflicts between the emigrants and the children of the native ones increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of the children of East Europe in the British schools is very well informed in the northern city of Kent where they begin to grow the conflicts between the native ones and the Slovakian emigrants.
Discussions, estorsión and quarrels between students already have reached even to the own parents.
The situation has arrived so far that the police of Chatmam arrested a Slovakian woman who was sticking woods to a student of ten years with a green twig.
In its defense it said that the girl was insulting to her son with insults of racist tone.
The police had to also act after an attack of two minor girls against a Slovakian emigrant.
The girls entertained to him with racist insults and they threw stones to him.
"When ibamos house, a boy approached towards us the shutdown of the bus and began to escupir to us.
When I said to him that she left it made the gesture send to us to apples and pears to us, and later one lowered the trousers and showed its buttock "described another disagreeable incident to us for The Times, the mother of the Slovakian student.
The complaints are of both parts.
One of the native ones even designated to the conflict with the emigrants of the east of Europe as of fight by the survival.
The cases already mentioned previously, show to us as the atmosphere in the English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Great Britain there are enrolled 70,000 Slovaks who came here by labor reasons.
Approximately about 30,000 Slovakian students attend the English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For the vistantes it is really the island of the freedom.
Any thing that hopes of its vacations can get to fulfill, whenever eliga correctly.
Sandy and golden, great beaches waves or a calm sea as a pool.
the palms and all including with waiters offering pizzas in the beach, ice creams or varied cocteles.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the island of the Caribbean Sea it can find all this much more and.
Only in an island it still finds much more and that island is Cuba, greater and the most beautiful one of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba got to be the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the place more beautiful than human eye has seen.
Havana became warehouse and port of embarkation of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted of America and took to Europe.
And later the American time arrived.
The National Hotel grew at the end of years 20.
It sent to construct it one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything what there was of criminality in the U.S.A. (and therefore, prohibited) welcome and was supported in Cuba like drugs, game and prostitution.
Between its guests they were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings arose, by wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of cult in years 50 of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar it had its yacht.
In the walls of the Bodeguita of Means they left to its companies stars of the world of the spectacle and politicians of all America.
And today?
In the walls of the habanense Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive National Hotel they mix coctel to him according to its desires.
And those automobiles or of cult of the years 50, until today continue working by Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived or a long time ago have oxidized between these humid and salty winds.
Havana, in even though special the old district is deteriorated remarkably, does not exist in the environs so many wonderful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are metamorfosean in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because the tourism brings as much necessary money, its development this guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years grew new hotels not only in Havana but also in Dock, the coast of the province of Holguín and in small barren islands like Coco Key, Key Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that very is valued by the lovers of the railroad.
The sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations to the narrow sugar factories by vias in electrical steam engines or.
Their garages by tens of years were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose models brothers whom there are in other parts of the world only find in the museums.
To where going?
The known place more stops most of the vistantes does not change.
And for that reason, it is not necessary to speak more of Havana or Dock.
Perhaps, to only remember that in already mentioned property of Hemingway there is a museum that stops those that is loving of the writer, do not have to let visit it.
The valley of Viñales is the most colorful corner from Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberante vegetation that grows in territories of limestone rock.
Limestone rock wooded hills, pylons escarped and elevated rocks of in the caidas ones of the valley, and in their grottos become aclimated fertile earth thanks to which rocky terrains form that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where it is cultivated, probably, the tobacco of greater quality in Cuba.
Visiting some of the Havanan factories of pure it can be with its end item.
Perhaps to somebody it seems to him interesting that there the Chilean part of the series was rolled, the Greater Zeman.
Trinidad
City as an older person ancestry that was founded not much after the Spaniards colonized the island.
The slavery and the sugar brought fame and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, specially influenced by the French colonos arrived later, in four centuries as soon as it has changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountain range of Escambray, is a place so separated that still in years 50 of the last century highway did not exist that united it with the rest of pais.
Such isolation helped it to remain outside the rest.
Nothing new was constructed and for that reason, either, nothing was destroyed, because each person was happy for having where to live.
If more time is had to be in Trinidad that a single afternoon, is worth the trouble to know interesting places in the near environs like the Beach of Cove or the valley of the sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of the Music, which animates with its music the silence the mornings.
Baracoa
Small city in the extreme west of Cuba, some consider it like most beautiful of the island.
Surely that opinion already is confirmed by the own way.
The two highways that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through discharges and broken mountains, thus how by a nature that as soon as it knows the action the man.
This Eastern place of Cuba has been registered like Patrimony of the Humanity by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in its church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact one is a cross that later arrived 100 years from the disembarkation) and from the hill, where was the castle and that now there is a hotel with its same name, the mountains and among them can be seen most well-known, the Anvil.
Coffee, rum, pure, the Masterful Mountain range, the Bay of the Pigs and the island of Pines, the Tropicana Night club, the pattern of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of Cobre, the Santería, African religion that the descendants of those slaves practiced, of all it could be filled many pages.
Nevertheless, as it is said, better to see it sometimes.
The allies are passive in Afghanistan, say the Americans
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment are what he is influencing in the march of the mission in Afghanistan.

The ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to data of the American army is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew in comparison with the last year in a 27 percent, and the Helmand province until a 60 percent.
Pàises of NATO has in Afghanistan around 40,000 soldiers of whom the fourth part is in the south of the territory.
Nevertheless, for the United States, the allies have arrived at the same limit as far as organization and equipment from the units.
Exactly they request more helicopters, soldiers and experts pra to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and the way in which we will reach them" said Gates.
In a similar sense also the Secretary General spoke today of NATO, Jaap de Hoop.
"it does not cheer knowledge to me that is what we have in the Earth and the sky in Afghanistan.
We have a ninety percent of soldiers and equipment that we would need, and that is little "said Of Hoop to Reuters agency in the closing of the encounter of three days with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Between paises attending in the last months the controversy reigns of if all the allies make the maximum in Afghanistan.
By liabilities it was criticized, for example, Germany.
"the Germans have in Afghanistan a relative number of replacements.
But they are in a zone of minimum violence and the fight exigencies are not as high there as in ours, in the South part and this of pais "Gates said.
The periodic Sun sensationalist, this week called vague to the soldiers German.
"the Afghan rebels discover that the Germans dedicate themselves to play whereas our boys fight" Sun wrote in a material accompanied with photographies of soldiers German playing the table tennis.
The Bild German responded to the attack and published a photography where the British troops played a party of rugby in the South part of Afghanistan.

Of similar form it also sees the economist it of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora: "We could pass the trillion during year 2009.
Exactament when that depends on the next budget that still we do not know.
If one saw that the situation in the political scene changed and the politicians were able to save, then could be delayed to year 2010.
But such change I do not see it "added.
The doubt grows

It compared today in front of a court to Jartúm to have given a name to a bear of peluche
The British professor judged in Sudan for insult the Islam has been the condemned Thursday in the evening by a court of Jartúm to 15 days of prison and to the expulsion, she indicated its lawyer.
The Briton was accused to have let to students of 6 to 7 years give the name of Mahomet to a bear of peluche when all representation of the prophet of the Islam is illicit.
He was stepible of a pain of latigazos.
This teacher of British school of age of 54 years in function to the Unity High School de Jartúm in Sudan, has been stopped Sunday in her accused house and of attack to the Islam and sedition, by virtue of article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, consequently of several complaints of parents of students before the Sudanese Ministry of the education.
History goes back in fact to the month of September, when this professor asks her students, of 6/7 years of age, to choose a name for the bear of peluche of the class.
"Eight names leave the mouth of the children, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", tells to the director of the school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 children of each 23 are elegigo to Mohamed like favourite name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but mainly a name very common in Sudan.
Soon the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear he - same it did not take any label with this name, but the problem is simply the one of the representation of the prophet considered like an insult to the Islam.

A dangerous exit that accumulated the records because of its duration, of its distance of the inhabitable modules, the rapidity with which has been imagined, instruments "chapuceados" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared then Tuesday that the astronauts had released of the Discovery shuttle the module Harmony, a cylindrical heavy piece in charge to welcome the European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (to see fitted).
This module is a type of platform of landing for the module-laboratories.
But it is necessary to be able to provide them in electricity.

The election of statu quo
No surprise Sunday, when coming out of the ballot boxes: the Russians are going to choose massively for the party of president Poutine, united Russia.
Confirming its aspiration to the stability, even to the authoritarianism, after a campaign very limited.
To three days of the legislative elections, Russian president Vladimir Putin today directs to the voters a message to them televised on the public chains, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does in quality of leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything be transparent receiving the foreign ambassadors, being contented with giving to a new load against the West accused of interference - his subject of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price a true democracy and wished honest elections, more transparent and more opened, elections without incidents", added.
According to the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
It denounces a campaign mancillado by pressures.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that he never has "had so dirty elections, until at the time of Eltsin".
After the repression of the manifestations of the last weekend, to the ex- champion of the world of check Garry Kasparov, the condemned to five days of prison for illegal manifestation, is prohibited the visits according to their lawyer.
"the Russians kept the mentality from homo sovieticus"
Behind these legislative elections without surprise two open questions are outlined much more:
Who will happen to Poutine to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday date of the first return of the presidential election, the 2 of March of 2008; the candidates must until the 23 of December to be made know.
Chosen in 2000 and chosen again in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot ask for the third consecutive mandate.
Then no successor emerges.
Which paper will play Poutine after March?
Prime minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party that elegería the government and the president?
Be that as it may, to the legislative elections like a the presidential ones, the salient power will prevail.
It is a tradition.
"the Russians kept the mentality from homo sovieticus, do not feel like owners of their destiny", considers sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Weighed independent center.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, of the state university of Saint Petersburg, goes back more far: the civil society was late in this cristianizado country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of the individualismo.
After the liberal reforms of the years 90, "Poutine it restored the model of a paternalista State, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by the terrorism, but by a certain economic relief", it considers Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "resign by own will to the personal responsibility" of those who briefly had given test after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why to reflect? "
The phenomenon touches all the social layers, including the world of the subjects.
And the administrative elite thinks to preserve statu quo: 65 governors (of each 85 heads of Russian regions) direct the local lists of united Russia.
The new concerned liberties of the West are often synonymous of chaos, like in years 90.
The opinion prefers the stability.
In name of which the Russians will not vote either by the extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, professor of age of 54 years: "why to reflect?
Those that they are to the power are not too bad, why to change them? "
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidential character, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, that describe the destinies of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, they are in free access.

Until recently, several States, like Germany, were against to the opening the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensible character of certain information.
As well as the supposed homosexualidad or handicap mental of certain victims of the deportation.
The registries of the concentration camps or the orders of halting established by the Gestapo had been reunited after war in a practical aim: to find to the countrymen deported or submissive in the work obligatory and, possibly, to contribute a test to them of its internamiento, with the purpose of opening the route to its indemnification.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 wage-earning permanent ones they deal with tens thousands of individual requests.
Nevertheless, for a part of the scientific community, the access to Bad Arolsen has a limited interest.
"there is nothing fundamentally no new that there is to hope of these documents", Professor Wolfgang Benz had declared in 2006, director of the Center of search on the anti-semitism in the Technische Universität of Berlin.

Although they are not in favor of which stock-market takes run in the last weeks of the year, these experts aim that "the stock market is maintained by the liquidity existence, arranged to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, specially the fixed rent, affected by the effect fled towards values of quality as much in the long sections as in the short ones".
For that reason, they think mainly that stock-market will have a lateral behavior rather, nonfree of volatileness "so that the impact is not known the probable reduction of the types of the Fed, dice the high level of crude and the danger of stimulus of the inflationary tensions".
Javier District, person in charge of sales of BPI in Spain, agrees whereupon it is not good moment to venture itself to say that he is going to have rally.
"it is not the thing for many joys", assures the expert.
The Ibex has lost near a 4% from the maximum ones marked the 8 of November when the index closed in the 15,945.7 points.
Even so all the experts do not have this so negative vision.
Juan Solana, analyst of Intermoney, thinks that Ibex 35 could close the year more near the 16,000 points thanks to the reconstruction of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the plans of pensions that take place every year in these dates.
Nevertheless, the expert clarifies that the different things will be something east year since thinks that rally will go ahead to the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not consider that volatileness is going to affect the tendency of the market.
On the other hand, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Bank, value that we are near technical levels and "therefore we could see a bounce of the index that could be seen impelled depending on the news that arrive from the U.S.A. as far as the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
The analysts are according to the hour to choose the values that will be the ones in charge to take to the Ibex towards new maximum levels.
Solana, of Intermoney, affirms that "this year touches to the great values".
The expert would include both in the portfolio to great banks and to some constructors "because when the date arrives, the electrical sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, Inversis Bank assures that the ascents will come from the hand of the bank and the industrial sector.
The constructors also will be able to benefit from this rally, in case of occurring.
"ACS takes to several months recovering positions and we hoped that other constructors as Railroad and FCC they follow his same way", explain the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase of the sales in the season of sales navideñas.
On the other hand, the expert thinks that the technological ones also will do it very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven year
In the last seven years, in only two occasions December has been a bearish month.
Authentic rally of year end was lived in 2003, exercise in which the stock markets left the crisis caused by pinchazo of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered a 28.17%, December registered a rise of 6,68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 the Ibex is the fifth consecutive year of gains (at the moment raises a 8.36% from January) and if it is able to count on his rally of year end.

So and as the Chain yesterday informed TO BE, to the lawyer of the Moral deputy ' popular' Juan, therefore measured, it stopped to him leaving the address of Morals with important documentation related to the plot.
It is more, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the presumed collection of commissions of Morals in exchange for facilitating the company/signature of a city-planning agreement with a Galician construction company to recalificar 200 hectares of land.

Bond accepts to head the candidacy of the PSOE by Toledo and to preside over the Congress if they win
Ex- minister of Defense Jose Bond has accepted the offer of the president of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in case the Socialists gain the general elections.
Thus they have announced it in press conference the secretary of Organization of the PSOE, White Jose, and the own Bond, after the meeting that has maintained east noon in the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive has justified the supply to the ex- minister because "it is important to count on the best ones" in the political life and Bond "is between the best ones".
In addition, it has aimed that "yes seems" that the politician manchego will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bond would replace like president of the Congress Manuel Marín, that the past made 15 public of November its decision of not appearing to the next general elections and leaving its race in the active policy to dedicate itself to fight against the climatic change in the university scope.
The ex- minister has recognized who the president of the Government has not let insist so that he returned to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, it has indicated that, like the citizens know who will be the economic vice-president if the PSOE gains the elections, its party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in a "act of transparency".
If it reaches the position, Bond hopes to turn the Camera "the house of the respect and not of the insult or the shout". and to cause that "it is looked more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes lamentably it seems that the only premises of Madrid where it is not possible to be spoken with tranquillity and calmness are the Congress, to the president of the Government in certain occasion they interrupted in the Senate 26 times to him".
Also, it has had words of praise for his present president, Manuel Marín and "its good one for doing" and has not wanted to see itself already occupying its position not to fall in which, according to it has indicated, his adversaries could see like "great power".
Climatic propaganda
Since the movement against the climatic change as much puts under insensitive persecution to the skeptics of its predictions like a those that prioritize other political and social battles, it is forced to show an iron coherence.
And plus a leader of the movement that is president of the Government as Zapatero and thinks that that fight is more important that the one of the islamista terrorism and until it sets out to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That exposition forces to him to explain why the action, or the inaction, of their Government has contributed decisively to that Spain heads the UE in breach of Kioto.
Who are the people in charge of the breach, in what sectors have taken place and why its Government, the one of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it demands to him to explain with the Maxima clarity to the Spaniards which are the measures that are going to take to restrain the climatic change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective power savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences will have.
That is, who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But neither there have been nor there will be those explanations.
Indeed because one is to sacrifice itself and to pay.
The measures against the climatic change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until céntimo of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE there is so dangerous similarity to him electoral to Zapatero who has hurried to deny it.
That is, which one is to save the planet with the anything, with pure propaganda, with eslóganes empty of all real consequence.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that so useful gentleman for the electoral campaigns that neither speak nor denounce nor demand, but adorns mítines and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it is limited to be merely virtual a contracting part and does not try that we move in bicycle or we refresh with the fan.

My attending physician releases one to me of his articles on rare investigations titled: ' the money produces cerebral activations, mainly if the others receive menos'.
That is, that the feelings that it generates the monthly payment of the workers depends on which the companions win.
The study has been made by means of tomográficas magnetic resonances in the University of Bonn, and the results are published number of Science in the last.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group of Image of Neurocognición of the Life&Brain Institute, in Germany: "the activation more hard took place when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed".

What insurance agrees to me?
The automobile insurance, that covers to the conductor before possible wrecks, supposes an important cost that will depend on diverse factors, such as the age, sex, the antiquity of the membership card, the civil state, the type of vehicle to assure or the use a this one, among others.
To have the car is only the principle.
And it is that, to choose the insurance of suitable automobile it is even more difficult that to choose the vehicle model.
In the first place it is necessary to know clearly of which we are speaking.
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance agency and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in a contract of insurances, that it establishes that the company receives the value of the decided premium in exchange for that person in charge is made of the obligation pay the indemnifications in case of wreck.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which settles down considering diverse factors, such as the age, sex, the antiquity of the membership card, the civil state, the type of vehicle to assure or the use that him a this one, among others.
The insuring companies establish their prices based on the statistics, so that to greater probability of suffering an accident, greater quota to pay.
It is for that reason for which as much the greater ones of 25 as the women have to pay prime more losses, since the statistics reflect that they have a smaller index of sinisterness due to its prudence.
Also, making use of the counts, the companies have reached the conclusion that the married people tend to have less accidents than the unmarried conductors.
The use that him of a the vehicle will be influenced in the frequency, and with it in the probability of having some type of mishap.
When increasing the frequency increases the probabilities.
The variables are many that the insurers consider at the time of establishing the price of the premium.
It is for that reason, that the conductor has to study the situation well to choose that insurance of automobile that better adjusts to its profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables at the time of choosing one or another type of insurance, so that this one, besides to adapt to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price to him.
The smaller young people of 25 years are with diverse disadvantages at the time of contracting an insurance a reasonable price, as they are the reduced experience in conduction and the antiquity of the membership card.
Although the ideal to be insured well is an insurance to all risk, exist other economic options.
The most cautious conductors can decide on a whole risk with tax exemption, so that they obtain the covers of an insurance to all risk but to a more feasible price.
This class of agreement would suppose that the client pays a part of the amount of the wreck.
"the part of the amount of the wreck that contributes the client will settle down based on the value of the premium, that will be higher at the most under is the amount", it specifies Luis Noguera, responsible maximum in Spain de First Europe, mediator of insurances online.
Another option is an extended insurance to third, so that the client makes sure the protection before damages caused to third, although not before the caused ones in its own car.
In addition, it would be covered by robbery, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
An advice.
If you are smaller of 25 years tries to be careful and to as far as possible avoid the wrecks, since this will repel in the advantage, being able to reduce the cost of the insurance in the future.
An advantage is a reduction on the tariff base that has the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on this tariff bases.
"the advantages and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of this one.
If the company has had a good year will be able to be allowed to increase the advantages ", it clarifies Noguera.
Passed the strip of the 25 years the conductors have easier at the time of contracting it an insurance, since the sinisterness index is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
, therefore most recommendable it is to contract to a whole risk with tax exemption.
"Normally the young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired at the time of being worth in an accident, and even at the time of the conduction", assures the director in Spain the European company, to which she adds that most of the accidents they take place in the second year of conduction, once passed already the ' fear of novató.
Nevertheless, if the client is married but still she does not have children is preferable whom an insurance to all risk, as long as its economic situation allows it, clear negotiates is.
On the other hand, the marriages with children are considered by the insurers like the public with smaller index of sinisterness, reason why the surcharges will be smaller.
In this case the best one surely would be one to all risk with tax exemption (being able to be this one of 300 euros), or, when it is had a high level of advantage, one to third extended as of the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out one more a relaxed conduction and have the greater one spending power to allow the luxury to assume an amount of greater tax exemption", sentences Luis Noguera.
For the pensioners an insurance to all risk with tax exemption (being this one of 150 euros), or one is recommendable to third extended when a high level of advantage is had.
It is necessary to also say that the automobile insurance is something important, not only because it covers to the possible conductor before wrecks, but because it represents an important cost, reason for which is fundamental to suitably study the insurance that agrees to us more according to our personal situation.

Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most awaited result, although both equipment will try to leave to by a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate in house and the Celtic knows that winning it would be first and a better eighth crossing would make sure.
To set of Gordon Strachan could to serve him even defeat to classify if the Shakhtar does not win, but not will be able to trust because to equality of nine points it happens is for the ucranianos, that lost the week last in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the milanistas will try to make bitter the night to him to the Scot, who trust putting for the second time in eighth in the reconstructed Champions League and of consecutive form, after indeed they were defeated in that round the last campaign with a goal of Kaka in the prorogation (1-0) after the 0-0 of the going.
Waiting for the victory of the ' rossonerí it will be the Shakhtar to which to only it is worth the triumph him, in case the Celtic loses, as much to put in eighth like following in the UEFA.
And he is that the Benfica, in spite of being last and without options to follow in the Maxima European competition, could reach the third seat with a victory, with which would play the UEFA.

New fears on the gas between Russia and the Ukraine
The increasing dispute by the price of the gas between the Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk of which it affects the export from the fuel to western Europe on the part of Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to European Unio'n (UE) it is directed through the Ukraine, reason why each rubbing between both nations is attention source.
Kiev has noticed that if Moscow increases the price of the gas, Russia will have to pay higher rates of transit.
A previous dispute the last year reduced the provisions to the states of the UE.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the ucraniano government and the Russian state, monopolistic owner of the gas, Gazprom, treating to decide the amount money that had to pay the Ukraine by the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom declared that it will receive more to the Ukraine, since this one is had it jeopardize to pay to a 50% extra in 2008 by the gas that comes from the Turkmenistán neighbor.
The analysts say that she could be that the Ukraine pays a 40% more by the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for the gas during the conversations" said the ucraniano Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinakh to the agency of the Reuters news.
"the changes in the prices of the gas would not have to be related to our arguments on the levels of the rates of transit [ towards western Europe ] via the Ukraine".
Last the great dispute by the gas between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut the supplying to the Ukraine in January of the 2006.
This meant a fall in the exports to western Europe, which raised the prices quickly.
The Russian gas represents the fourth part of the provision of the UE.
Russia has the greater gas reserves of the world, but good part of her not yet completely is developed.
Like result, Gazprom complements its own provision with gas of Turkmenistán and other ex- Soviet nations of Central Asia.
NHS "will have to prove the foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to control the registries of criminal records of the employees of outside Europe, said a watchman.
The recommendation of the general auditor Robert Black came after it was verified that a foreign doctor was related to the attack to the airport of Glasgow, in June.
Black also showed its preoccupation of which the Scottish NHS does not have exact idea of the foreign amount of personnel whereupon it counts.
Nevertheless, its report indicated other controls that are correctly carried out through a sample of five authorities of health.
The general auditor checked the contracted foreign amount of personnel outside the European economic area, as a result of the attacks to the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqian doctor of the Hospital Royal Alexandra de Paisley, were arrested in the airport after hitting jeep in the doors of the terminal building of the airport.
It was one of the three doctors who acted in the Old Bailey by video conference in October, defendant in relation to the assumptions attempted with car pump in United Kingdom.
NHS hopes to carry out the controls of pre use to the candidates, to make sure that they fulfill the qualifications, the experience and the authorization to work in United Kingdom.
Although the meeting of health of Scotland uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out the controls of criminal records, the agency does not have jurisdiction to obtain this data outside Great Britain.
The report of the general auditor recommends, among other measures, that the meetings must have the guide of the Criminal Bureau Record, that helps to the employers with the penal controls in many countries outside Great Britain.
"Although we found some of the personal registries with evidences of these controls, this it is not a routine revision", it says the report.
Black declares that the Scottish NHS has a high level of fulfillment of their own policies of use, but indicates that: "our report puts of relief the areas that can be improved to guarantee that it is had the necessary information in the foreign number of personnel of the NHS."
The president of the BMA Scotland, Dr Peter Terry said that it was "very little probable" that the pre-use controls can identify to used potentials of NHS that could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"the report suggests them pre-use controls work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear which is the added value of the done recommendations", it explained.
The Scottish authorities of health declare that at the moment they have 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses
But the general auditor noticed that the number can be higher, partly because the meetings have problems in identifying which are the employees who count on indefinite authorizations of residence.
The investigation also found that the procedures of verification established by the authorities of NHS in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being fulfilled widely.
This includes the permission, passport control of work and control of qualifications.
The Scottish government is at the moment reviewing the policy and guide of pre-use of the foreigners in the NHS.
The secretary of health, Nicola Sturgeon, declares: "She had a great interest that was carried out east work as a result of the terrorist attack of the airport of Glasgow.
He added that the Scottish government, altogether with the health meetings, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the guides of control of pre-use for all the work groups - including a the foreigners which they had predicted to publish the next month.

Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested to 208 militants of terrorist cells that planned an imminent attack to petroliferous facilities, as well as attacks against monks and forces of security.
The state television of the greater petroleum supplier of the world said that one of the cells was planning the contraband of missiles.
Supporters of Al-Qaeda have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, from 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants formed by foreign residents planned an attack to a petroliferous installation in the province of the East, declared the televising report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 cash to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the greater petroliferous plant of the world, after an insolvent attack of Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, mentioning a declaration of the Minister of the Saudi Interior, said that 18 of the arrested ones belong to a cell led by a "expert in launching of missiles", that has entered the country.
The minister said that the militants had planned the entrance by contraband from eight projectiles to the country.
Other 22 of the prisoners were planning murders of religious leaders and forces of security.
The government noticed the religious leaders that they must are more active to stop to the saudíes that travel to Iraq to be united like militants to Al-Qaeda to fight against the allied forces and to endorsing Muslim the Shiita government, who is considered hereje by the Suníes saudíes more ends.

Climate of Venus can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have been once an appropriate place for the life, declared scientists yesterday.
The data of an European spaceship in orbit showed the planet most similar to an Earth binocular of which it had been observed previously.
Venus is the planet closest to the Earth.
Both planets have so large similar and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly more near the sun.
It makes million years, Venus could have had conditions similar to which made of the Earth an inhabitable planet, create the scientists now.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the effect conservatory, the atmospheric erosion by the solar radiations and the slower solar rotation sent to Venus to a type of very different development.
Today the planet does not have water, the temperature of the surface is sufficient to melt lead and is eroded by huracanados winds and ray storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, that has studied the planet by a year, offer a panorama of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes because of the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics of the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the mission Venus Express, declares: "the climate in Venus is being clarified porqué is so different from the one of the Earth, when they are two so similar planets.
"Our new data do possible to construct a scene in that Venus began like the Earth, possibly with an inhabitable medio.ambiente makes million years."
Police seizes "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, that declares Uranian is enriched, was seized yesterday by the Slovakian and Hungarian police.
Portavos of the police declared that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm if he were Uranian enriched but it said that it could be sold by 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds sterling).
Still he remains open
Mitt Romney says that he is not worthy that the presidential candidates respond the questions of a snow monkey.
However, the republican candidates for the presidency possibly accede to maintain a debate in YouTube, in common and current which voting they record questions in video and they send them for his diffusion between the candidates.
No of the questions presented/displayed in afternoon of Wednesday 28 of November was more ridiculous than the one of the snow monkey that asked the democrats about the climatic heating in the debate of the republican party of YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the republican party facing the elections of the next year.
It is not known exactly how the producers of the Cnn, that Co-sponsor the debate, chose the videos of YouTube to show the candidates to aspirings.
But first half an hour of the debate, longest dedicated to a single subject, one focused in immigration.
The subject is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
Cnn asked a group of indecisos voters who raised the dial when they listened to ideas that pleased to them: the emitters noticed approval tips when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The harder interchanges of words at night occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been sharpshooting in the crucial surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of Romney then was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
It attacked Mr. Romney, blaming the ex- governor of Massachusetts to contract illegal immigrants to work in its house.
Both responded aggressively when they asked to them if some candidate could support a "amnesty" (allowing the illegal ones to regularize its situation and giving the possibility them of obtaining the citizenship).
The smaller candidates like Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman of Colorado, obtained agreement with the subject.
No has the word of being name candidate, but both perhaps remain in the race because both alerted on the subject of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and general terms, the candidates share points of view: increase of the monitoring in the borders, intolerancia with the illegal immigrants.
This topic, next to the fear to the toxic toys of China and other preoccupations by the outside, aid to the republicans to forget, or to diminish, the divisions between liberal and the Christian conservatives.
But the debate was transformed into discomfort when they appeared other subjects.
Mr. Guiliani they asked to him why it had supported the control of arms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated about if the water immersion had to consider a torture.
A person asked if the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This took to Mr. Giuliani to encounter towards the position of which to although the Bible it was its favorite book, it literally did not believe in the history of the Jonás and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the capital punishment.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all the expectations, in the first place in the most recent survey of Iowa, thanks to its Christian conservadurismo of long data said that the capital punishment was painful but necessary.
When it was pressed to respond if Jesus would be to favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too intelligent like being candidate in the elections.
The race follows unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in Iowa, coincidently with the campaigns of collection of bottoms of the liberal Rum Paul, and his heated declarations of the debate of Wednesday.
They two have left from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not reach agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united convincingly to the early party and with a winning message on the greatness of America, satisfying to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from being clear.
Dolores Labour Party members
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in that sinking; but also it emerges
As the political scandals follow in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
They seem to have sold influences, neither is exhorbitantes accounts of hotels in Paris, nor absorbed of extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed which a rich businessman has disguised to contributions to the government party Labour Party member English, of than 650,000 pounds sterling (1.3 million dollars), by near four years using more false names, and that the party did not denounce it.
Two months ago, when prime minister eluded to call to an election, insulting stupidly the British intelligence declaring that the opinion surveys did not influence in their decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead of that, like Vince Calbe, the liberal democrat leads with increasing talent, because feared Mr. Brown has happened to be Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in problems, demonstrated to the regulatory weakness and the poverty of judgment at moments of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the code of taxes have put the enterprise, together groups, against the government.
The fiscal authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed unimaginable an administrative shoddy work.
Trio of distant generals initiated a riot in the camera of the Lores, protesting against the cuts in the military cost: to be ministers of the Armed Forces is, protested, a use of half time.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General Labour Party member (and previous accomplice) has already resigned.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
The governments can arrive at a flexion point after they are incapable to govern.
People do not create to them like politicians, but usually they suspend its incredulity when a new lot assumes the control.
Once it is clear that prime minister cannot improve the things, that to him long time does not reduce, that suspension is of more: the officials government begin to fail; the cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press looks for the bad news; and the government is put to the defensive and he does not focus.
In a part, the position of Brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders it cannot defend arguing that he is new.
Although it wanted to apostatize of Tony Blair, was its superior lieutenant.
The problems of the Northern Rock and the tax of authority registry, are related to the decisions that Brown did like chancellor of the State Treasury.
And even though directly it is not surrounded in the misfortunes of Blairish - or "cash for partners", the investigation of the financing of the political parties - the voters can assume that if it is it.
Nevertheless, the situation of Mr. Brown is not as bad as it seems.
Gaffes is not as bad as the Tories wants to show.
Like in Mr. Bean, anybody there is dead, nor it has been swindled directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what the tendencies naturally Stalinistas of Mr. Brown have promised always: a trustworthy and brutal government.
The new political scandal of the donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with charity gifts, says that he does not wish public recognition by his benevolence.
Perhaps this is thus, but the decision does not take he.
The laws against the anonymity for the great political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has right to knowing who is buying access to which they have the power.
Mr. Watt, who said to know in the agreement of Mr. Abraham, and who this one was not illegal, obvious will face Jon Mendlesohn, head of collection of bottoms which he asked himself to him on the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown until is not implied now: there is nothing suggests him knew of these performances, although the thickness of the payments was done after it took control from the office in June.
Until the moment prime minister has made half of the work.
He has been fast in condemning its party to break the law, but it is diluted in the decision making by a familiar subject, a commission of investigation on the subject - lead, largely, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, is a subject of the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, like finding a head permanent and independent for the Commission of Norms in the Public Life, because it has not been having one for six months, and in addition it must press by a genuine reform of the financing of the parties.
This will require an arduous cooperative work of the Labour Party members with the Tories, and perhaps a resignation to special the financial situation that has with the unions - bitter measures for a partisan one like Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
The preservative ones now have a good level of support in the surveys; he is two years old to gain voters; and the only way that can move to the victory is in acting with an impeccable probity and a solid competition.
Sharks cards
The crisis of the mortgages subprioritizes is infecting the American market of the credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, he is natural that dorsal fins swim around moved.
Today which the American market of the house is in crisis, the predators have their glances put in the market of the country of the credit cards.
The analysts in Goldman Sachs calculate that the losses in credit cards can reach the 99 million dollars if the crisis of the mortgages subprioritizes infects other forms of consumption credits.
Signs of I infect already are seen.
There is an increase as much in the card positions like in the rates of delinquency, that measures the proportion of the balances that have not been amortized or that they have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced the last month that has taken 1.4 million position in its business from financing to the American consumer, partly due to the weakness of the borrowers of cards.
Nevertheless, he is very early for the panic.
The dilatoriness and the delinquency are in low levels.
According to Moody's, a qualification agency, the third trimester the rate of delinquency of 3,89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained partly by technical factors.
A change in the American law of bankruptcy of the people (2005) gave rise to an abrupt fall in the bankruptcy requests, that as well represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of requests (and therefore, of dilatoriness) would be growing again, or can happen that the conditions for the borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports solid rates of payment, that show how much of his debts they pay to the consumers every month.
And the confidence in the credit cards and the values endorsed by assets is enough firm, in spite of the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney de TowerGroup, an investigating company/signature, predicts that the volumes of emission for year 2007 will be near a 25% more stops than the last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between the mortgages subprioritize and the market of the credit cards certainly exists: the consumers please to now load the debts to the credit cards that the credit organizations are expiring.
But the emitters of the credit card watch plus the liquidity flow that the active values, so that the prices in fall necessarily do not drive a change in the deserving capacity of the borrowers.
They can even work to surpass the emitters.
The incentives so that the consumers continue amortizing the mortgage decrease if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and like result, the payment of the debt of the card raises in the list of priorities.
The card emitters also can respond fast and flexible to the difficult conditions that the mortgage moneylenders, changing types of interest or altering deserving balances.
That in theory would have to reduce the risk of a fast retasación of assets.
"we are not going to wake up a day and to evaluate all the loans again", says Gary Perlin, head of finances of One Capital.
If a sudden infection of subprioritizes in the market of the credit cards is improbable, the risks of a maintained reduction are much more real.
If the prices of houses are lower and a contraction of the credit pushes America to the recession, the industry doubtlessly faces a more severe future.
It is necessary to continue watching those dorsal fins.
Guilty declared British bankers in Enron case
Three British bankers who went in opinion by their responsibility in the frauds with the previous head of the financial office of Enron, Andrew Fastow, were declared guilty east Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally were found innocent of seven positions of fraud to coludir itself with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to become rich at the cost of the employees.
They were sent in opinion in January.
But during the hearing before judge Ewing Werlein Jr of district U.S, each one it was sentenced like culprit of colución in fraud.
The three old executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of Scottish group PLC in the Royal Bank, became famous cause in Great Britain by the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, its case marks the loose end of an investigation sent after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the positions against the bankers were of to have alerted in 2002 to Fastow that was objective of a governmental investigation on the fall of Enron.
The accusation against the bankers - "NatWest Three" doubled - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and its previous superior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a society of Enron controlled by Fastow, that was the creator of a myriad of frauds in Enron, which they helped to his spiral of fall in the bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valorized the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British knew that he would valorize in rise.
A company under the control of Kopper bought the interest of bank of the subsidiary in $1 million dollars.
The bankers paid to Kopper 250,000 dollars by interests in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow it represented Enron falsely, because the power company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest by its parts of the subsidiary.
But 20 million were into the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7,3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received near 12,3 million, according to the accusation.
In January of the 2004, Fastow was sentenced guilty by two positions of conspiracy in the collapse of Enron.
The trio of British was arrested three months later.
Fastow is fulfilling a sentence of 6 years in a federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is turning a pain of 3 years and a month in Texarkana.
Each one of the three British bankers must pay 1 million dollars that they required to live in the United States while the judgment was celebrated.
Enron, one of the seven bigger companies of the nation, declared in bankruptcy in December of 2001 after years of tricks in the accounting, could not hide the debt of million or make seem successful its businesses that fail.
The collapse made lose thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in values of market and more than two million in plans of pensions.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and previous the executive head, Jeffrey Skilling was ordered to criminals the years happened through their rolls in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is fulfilling a sentence of more than 24 years.
The sentence of Lay by conspiracy, fraud and other positions was suspended when the last year died of an attack to the heart.

But this one is a small cost for some of the rich Russians.

"We lived the same in 1890, when some well-off Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen like materialists", says Marshall Goldman, senior professor of the Center Davis for the Russian and eurasiáticos studies of the University of Harvard.
"Like the saudíes of the years the 70 and Japanese in years 90, the Russians are emerging like the greatest consumers and combat engineers from the world".

The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44,57 dollars).
"the Russians are interested in learning what marks is the most expensive and best one," Mr. Gijrath said, that he seated patriotically in stand of the Dutch real porcelains Delft, in front of a so large reconstruction mural of a painting of Rembrandt, done of painted tiles by hand.
"Of course, the Russians more are interested in bling-bling."
In fact, the salesmen said that the rich Russians of more trajectory (10 to 15 years, for estandares Russian) have changed their tastes from showy logos to the limited edition marks, that would not be exposed in a commercial fair.
However, several thousands of people: millionaires in cash, emissaries of the millionaires or tourists, fill to the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
In the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, chief of a main directorate of the beds King Koil, it said that one sold two systems of mattress of $70,000 dollars each, done of entretejidos silk, cashemere and cotton with gold threads.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, ordered of sales for A1 Moto, company that equips cars of high range with alarm systems ad hoc, it said that the company had sold the shining orange Porsche, by $170,000 dollars to a Russian millionaire.
In the evening of Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, company that modifies cars of luxury for particular requirements, said that it had sold three grills of car with form of bracelet of chains, for Rolls Royce Phantom, in $55.000 dollars each one.
It showed the reporter a wheel of car, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with inlaid crystal rays of Swarovski color, so that it was resembled a roulette wheel. The cost: $22,000 dollars for four wheels.
The cost: $22,000 for to Seth of four.
"the Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife done of zirconium buckets, is not necessarily going to lead on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"It is going to maintain the car in his garage, next to other 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of their Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the Russian "millionaire" phrase does not mean exclusive feature, given the big wave of prices of the real estate properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow does three or four years, already he is probably a millionaire, at least in the paper if it is not it in cash," it said.
"It has more of them of which you think."
Those that was not millionaire could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian company/signature of handling of assets.
The company made four red telephone boxes (British style) stuffed with batteries of false tickets of a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the one in charge of marketing of the company, said that its equipment had printed 500,000 false tickets for the Fair of the Millionaire.
The visitors stopped to shake money batteries, requesting to their friends who removed photos with their moving bodies while they rested on piles of money, or pocketing a pair from million.
"You see, in Moscow, all can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
Surgery "shoddy work" could be cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the previous day to Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston watched through the window of the restaurant "A little healthier" and vió how an ambulance raised by White Cape Cod, two doors more down in avenue West Scott.
Suddenly, it appeared a car of the patrol of the police.
And later another one.
"Then I saw raise the ambulance", said Mr. Livingston, supervisor of the restaurant, that day Wednesday.
"There it was when I knew that somebody had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Stream, of 41 years, assistant of the director of the department of the police of Newark.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure made by nonauthorized a plastic surgeon, who not yet is identified by the police, but that works in the house of the 212 of the Av. West Scott.
The authorities still do not determine what caused the death of Mrs. Arroyo, but wait for the toxicológico test although the results will not be available until a few weeks. It will help to solve the mysterious death that it has ashamed to the superior rows of the police of Newark.
Mrs. Arroyo had been assistant of the director of the police, Garry F. McCarthy, from September of 2006, and its voice was familiar to many in the department.
"It was loyal, worker and tenacious", she says to Mr. McCarthy on Stream in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"It was my guardian".
It protected to me ".
Mr. McCarthy said that Stream was the wife of Jimmy Stream, an ex--official of police of Newark that works for the Commission of Control of the Spirits, and that left two children of 14 and 11 years, and one hijastra.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman of the public prosecutor of the Union of the County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine if Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of nonauthorized a surgical procedure.
"That is one of the possibilities," declared Walsh.
"It is an investigation in course."
The authorities said that they arrived the house near 3 P.M.
Of the 21 of November and they found to Mrs. Arroyo in a sofa.
It was declared dead in the place.
It has happened more than one week and the authorities have said little on their investigation or on the owner of the house, call Flower Daisy I castrate.
Mrs. Walsh could not say if Mrs. Castro has been interrogated by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine what leaves from the house was used as it consults medical.
Wednesday, nobody responded to the door in the home of Mrs. Castro, where a withered rosal is located in the front part of the house, and a Dalmatian barks in the later part.
A labeled blue drum as "vainillina ethyl" - used as substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - was in the door of the garage, next to a door that leads to the cellar.
Two mountain bicycles hang of hooks to a side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when arrived at Newark after 25 years in the department of the police of New York, Mrs. Arroyo was of a inestimable aid to know the new city and its robust political culture insular.
"She would say," you must watch with this one or that one ", said.
"It always was here when I was, and also when no.
He is embarrassing."
One hopes that the federal reserve will trim the rates to raise stock-market
The actions jumped yesterday to both sides of the Atlantic after the market hoped that the federal reserve calmed the conditions of credit with cuts to the interest rates, that were increased with tranquilizers commentaries of the vice-president of the central bank of the U.S.A..
The bags became loose in London, New York and through Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Horseradish tree Bernanke, president of the reserve, declared that the hacedores of policies must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of the financial markets.
In a effort clear to tranquilize the markets in the middle of increasing samples of credit bags, Mr. Kohn by the end of said that to the recent turbulence era "partly spent by the improvement in the market September and during October".
If it persisted the tendency to the rise, would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and businesses, said Kohn.
The commentaries were taken by the investors like a signal that the reserve is ready to inject capital fresh in the markets of the U.S.A. and to make later cuts of the type of interest, to stabilize the conditions of the credit.
The observations also helped to calm Wall ßstreet in the middle of the bad news for the economy of the U.S.A., like the sales of houses that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were accentuated by a warning of Bear Stearns, investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, which is equivalent to 4 % of their total manual labor, in a global reduction of costs to compensate the losses of his investments in the mortgages sub-it prioritizes of the U.S.A..
It is hoped that only 20 of those positions enter London, where the bank uses 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones raised in 331 points, or 2,55%, to the closing to 13.289.40, whereas ample index S&P 500 raised 2.65%.
In London, index FTSE 100 raised 165,5 points, or 2,7%, to the closing to 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds sterling to the value of the companies of first order of Great Britain.
The Dax index of Germany raised 2,6%, and CAC40 of France was upon the 2.3%.
Before, the reappearance of the tension of the credit in the markets stood out after a strong demand in an auction of bottoms to three months of the European Central bank, that considered those loans to the European commercial banks in 4,7%, the highest tariff from April of the 2001.
The pressure to the Bank of England to follow the performance of the federal reserve and the ECB and to inject bottoms extra in the markets of values in London, tensionaron the credit and the rates of the loans to three months "Libor" between the British banks, meant the greater rise from September, of 6,59%, after a constant ascent from the 12 of November.
England takes with judgment the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here there are two dilemmas, each one as difficult as the other.
Who must strike to Nº 6 by England in east Kandy weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no is less important front to the first test against Sri Lanka, who must make the decision?
The second question is excellent because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is in loan with that particular title at least, is here for helping Peter Moores, the trainer, and to Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and in addition because the writing-desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is being begun to fill of supplies to become national selector, and if no, in one part Time.
The one that it does not obtain the sixth place of bat will be unfortunate, but the life often is unjust and the sport also.
It is not easy to throw what a man in the top does more of his profession, while another one never goes more alla of the inferior level, sometimes by lack of luck than by capacity.
Not only in cricket the election is difficult, because judgments are required that always finish being subjective.
It is the right time so that Bopara rises?
He is right for Shah if he does it?
The same question could be done in another aspect if, Edwards says to John or "executive Tubby" Banerjee, two young brilliants with good degrees and that know the business well, they had to be promoted to the board: only there is site for one of them.
Who must say which is a good level for a player of cricket, unless they give the occasion him to sink or to swim to following chance?
The figures naturally have a great influence in the decisions, but thus also they have opportunities.
Within an equipment, a player of cricket must catch the eye of the captain at the same time to take wicket and a batter to be able opportunities to change the order if he wants to have impact like player someday.
But to catch the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many improved the last season, for example, James Anderson, who plays surely in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares for fit and bowls like the wind in the networks.
Anderson took 32 wickets from first class in 33 races by each one to gain a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both have had their high moments and can hope more of these.
The games of Shah or Bopara in the stage of Asgiriya can be only one question of opinion.
The option can break or make the race of a man, or can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and it did it well in first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but Paul Collingwood was, fighting to settle down itself at the same time who got to become an importance player, and in spite of writing down one hundred a double one against Australia in Australia, he can be still underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more a discussion in the session of today in the stage of Asgiriya, will follow their instincts of conservation and will favor the greater experience of Shah by on the exhuberancia of the Bopara young person.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah it is its brilliant and valuable test of debut of principles of the 88 in Bombay, 32 hundreds of first class as opposed to only 6 of Bopara, that, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent antedecentes against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten races in its two turns in May against West Indians in the test in Lords, its house like player del Middlesex, and that caused an immediate rejection of selectors when Vaughan demanded its place for the following encounter, seemed to have taken from his batting something of élan that in Bombay.
On the contrary, the equipment of Essex has joie of vivre in swords.
He falls in love by anything in the field with cricket and its attitude was summarized like when it overturned his vehicle in a exhibition for the patrocinador of cars of England, Volkswagen.
It suffered injuries of smaller importance and, presumably a shock, but the first thing that did was to remove its Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and to call to Alastair Cook, its teammate that watched the distance, to say to him with excitation: "It dresses that".
Bopara is the best player, it is including his happens slippery to have effects in its plays that seem to satisfy it, because it bats with confidence and ability.
To choose the suitable man is a thing, to choose the best moment, another one.
Perhaps that is the true art of the selection.
My inclination would be to give to Bopara its opportunity, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as they suggest the leaves of the tea, is he who plays this weekend here.
Buses bring to the refugees of return to the work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqian refugees of Syria began to arrive yesterday at Bagdad, expelling to the exiliados ones that they remained without cash, without extensions of the visa and to which they hoped that the city returned to normality.
Some had even returned to fight against the militants who lead them outside their homes.
In the station of bus of Mansour, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official convoy of the government composed of a dozen of bus, the terminal was full of refugees of Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Bagdad," it says to Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunnite doctor.
"I returned today reason why I saw in the TV and what I have read in newspapers, on the happened thing in Bagdad and that he is safe now".
"They say that the army of Mahdi let kill people", it declares, talking about to the Shiite military service of the religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, that ordered to its troops a momentary cease.
Qassim to the Atwani, Shiite of 38 years and professor in the Sunnite area of Amariyah, returned with its two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want to the Iraqians working in its country.
Their Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called it by telephone to say to him that a allied force of the U.S.A. helped to remove to Al-Qaeda outside its bastion to the west of the capital, and they were urgent it to that it returned.
One of just arrived from Jordan was the head of a Sunnite and Shiite tribe who had been lead from her home in Sleikh to the north of Bagdad, by an attack of grenades, after she insisted to the citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
It had come to fight.
"two days ago, some of my friends called to me and they said to me that they had begun a military service anti Al-Qaeda in Sleikh and that needed my support and the one of my companions".
"For that reason I have returned today", declared Sabaah Alu Obeidi, of 62 years.
Many said to be attracted by the increasing calm in the capital since the troops of the U.S.A. strengthened groups of "worried citizens", armed and that they work in cooperation with the military of the U.S.A. to defend his vecindarios.
But many declared to have returned by the refusal of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1,3 million Iraqians years settled down in the last.
Salaam al-Samarrai, of 51 years and father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion between the exiliados ones, that Nouri al-Maliki, Shiite prime minister, asked the Syria government to impose restrictions to visas of the refugees to force the people to return.
Than two and more average million people they create to have fled from the country because of the sectarian groups of the death.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and insisted to the government to let grant visas to the Iraqians, to force them to return to Iraq", the Sunnite said.
"I cannot believe in a government who supports the criminals who set afire my house after I left it".
Part of the reason of the cease of the violence is that the Sunnite have been expelled from the Shiite zones and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
The fear exists from which a sudden big wave of refugees makes arise the sectarian tensions again and begins the fight.
The small Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is first in the professional formation and it even shines by the international direction of its superior schools.
Like in all the country, the sarlandeses only lack an educative field.
"I explained Yesterday by fiftieth time to not sarlandés that we are not franseses" - that was moto ironic on if same of the smallest federal state for its cencuentenario.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great paper in the educative system of the Sarre that in a study of the Institute of German Economi'a (IW) call "Bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
This way, the superior schools by tradition have good relations with the neighboring countries.
The university of Saarbrücken was fused in 1948 by the franseses.
Until today the students can finish here their university race with two or three dipolmas.
By consequence, the procentaje of the foreign students is high, of 15, 6 by hundreds.
Nevertheless, the number of originating students of the Sarre is superior to the average in the superior schools. Many of them do not have a bacillerato.
"In the Sarre the system takes advantage of the professional education", says Axel Plünnecke, experte of educative sector in the Institute of German Economi'a (IW).
More of each five young people it makes its baccalaureate in the Professional School. Thus, it is that the Sarre is 7 points percent over the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the fan of possibilities for an professional-academic education is very ample.
The offer of the double races, in relation to the number of population, is the best second in Germany.
In spite of the practical professional formation and an increasing demand, the number of titleholders in Sciences of Engineering lowered to a third years in the last.
That was the reason for which the Ministry of Education of the Sarre forced the superior schools to make more publicity for the specialties in Sciences of Engineering.
"After the first study of IT IS ABOVE, we made some reforms in the schools of general education", affirms a spokeswoman of the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative tests in all the country.
So that the children begin the sooner to study the last year of the called project "Kita-Jahr", this one does not have any cost. Meanwhile, this model estades also imitates the federal others.
The comparison with the next studies will show if it has increased the yield of the students.
According to the report IT IS ABOVE of year 2003, the number of slow students developing student desminuyó of the 29 to a 20 percent.
But, in general, the Sarre did not improve much like other federal states.
In Baviera, the students know to calculate better.
For misfortune of the sarlandeses, the report IS ABOVE does not compare the knowledge of the foreign languages, although in this field they could obtain good results.
Although the sarlandeses are not French, the language of the neighbors is an obligatory subjet in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chávez changes the hour.
Póximamente in Venezuela will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
The 9 of December president Hugo Chávez lets modify the schedule in the South American country half an hour retarding the clock.
At the moment Chávez is staying as a comedian in Spain.
Since it has informed the Government reporter of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the hour will happen less to four hours GMT.
This way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Among other Chávez things, like enemy of the United States, it justifies its desición saying that the United States imposed in their day the obligation to the world when changing one hour complete.
In addition, Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the rupture of the relations with their neighboring country Colombia because of the action with taking of hostages.
The nationalist of lefts said that she would maintain no relation neither with the Chief of State nor with the Colombian government until the conservative Alvaro Uribe continued being the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do it", says Chávez, that it is driving a constitutional reform where the citizens of the petroliferous country must decide Sunday in referendúm.
With this reform its power in the country could be extended enough.
The reason of the conflict was the desición taken by Uribe when retiring the mandate of Chávez in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was the liberation of the hostages.
Chávez Sunday said criticizing that the decision that took Uribe is victim to Venezuela.
Also in Spain it is spoken much on Chávez.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why you do not shut up yourself", it is the phrase that already has unloaded average million people.
This phrase pronounced the King of Spain that felt annoying by the continuous interrupcciones on the part of the Populists of lefts in the last Latin American Summit.
In 2007 the diminution of the real wage threat to the Germans.
According to a prognosis, this year a diminution of the real wage threat to the employees German in spite of a strong conjuncture.
The experts present/display a great amount of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Foundation Hans Böckler, the employees German would have to count in 2007 with count-I fix wages for real more loss than the previous year.
"the fault of that is the weak evolution of the wages, the increase of the tax on the added value and estirón of the prices of foods and the energy", informed to the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn into the Institute into Macroeconomics and Investigation into the economic cycles.
Also the new obligations to insure of unemployment can correspond to the employees.
Minister of Finances Peter Setinbrück said to the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the present situation, the intention to diminish the load of insurance of unemployment 3,3% when happening from a year to another one, is right and reasonable.
Naturally, the work office does not have to put again in a disagreeable situation, requesting credits and subventions to the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social-Democratic party.
Tuesday public was made who the rate of inflation with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the sector of petroleum derivatives reached the highest level during 13 years.
When comparing the prices with the last year, these are increasing 3 %.
Venus: twin Earth brother.
In spite of its atmosphere it is not adapted for the life, Venus is the planet most similar to the Earth, something that until had not considered now. The European sounding "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and eddies in the poles, such that also appear in winter in the Earth.
Three decades ago the investigators they already had the suspicion that rays in Venus could exist.
But now the European sounding has brought new tests: the atmosphere discovered electromagnetic waves on the brink of madness. In Venus the rays cayen of a height of 54 kilometers of a cloud and behind another one, Cris Russell of the University of California in the Angels tells the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of the life of Urey-Miller, the rays caused the Earth life: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, on the other hand, had given origin to the amino acids that are the basic components of the life.
In Venus it is not thus: if someday there were life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution ", explains Are Solomon of the Institution Carnegie de Washington.
Today, in the surface of Venus it cannot have life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than in the Earth and in the surface temperatures of 500°C reign, oscillating in such a way that temperatures can be reached below cero.
"Possibly, Venus is" a diabolic "Earth binocular, but it continues being a binocular", said Russell.
The primary target of the mission "Venus Express" is to respond to the question of why Venus, so similar to the Earth by its mass and size, has had a so different evolution.
As from the Nineties there were no special missions, single for investigation of this planet, the launching of "Venus-Express" in November of 2005 was a very important step for the investigation of Venus.
The last results of the investigations that are going to be presented/displayed in many articles of "Nature", according to the opinion of the investigators, emphasize not only the unicity of Venus in the Solar System.
"This desmuestra also that the neighboring planets have more common characteristics with the Earth of which there were assumption", THAT informs.
In spite of already known stormy winds in the North Pole, the investigators also discovered in the South polar region a vortex formed by the clouds that more express turns.
This phenomenon remembers to the wind flows in the high terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, according to it describes a team of investigators of Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Space Special and Physical Astrophysics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the almost equal mass to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost so great.
This planet also called dawn star or stars vespertine orbits around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its period of rotation is slower: a day in Venus is equivalent to 243 days in the Earth.
Although Venus with its skin temperatures of 460 degrees and with their atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not resemble much the Earth, the scientists leave from the base of which both planets had formed in the same conditions.
In both planets agglomerate water was had that in the Earth remained in the oceans, but in Venus it dissociated in the universe.
Whereas the Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, in Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended the meeting of Merkel with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, President Federal, insists on the aim of the fight between the parties by the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.

The reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery caused great lacks of understanding in the relations Chinese-German.
Thus, the Chinese government not only retired the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Started off Social-Democratic), the Minister of Finances of Germany, but that in addition, according to informative sources of the magazine "Spiegel", congealed the call strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Outer Subjects of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Head of Chinese Government, demanded the Federal Chancellor Ángela Merkel who recognized this reception of Dalai Lama like an error.
Affirming the position of China, Wen Jiabao said that Chinese it would not accept that the European politicians received to the religious leader of the tibetanos in their official position.

In Tolouse also cars and buildings were burned public.

In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, demonstrates that the coalition as far as the content arrived at its last point and that it is not necessary to hope nothing else of her.
But in what country the Chancellor really lives?
After its exasperating performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the House of Representatives it is necessary to say: she does not live in the country that she would have to be governed by her.
As far as the reproach that was made by have dedicated him repeatedly to performances in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
It said that that would be a provincial way and thus it showed made state that does not want to understand what interests to the critical.
In the House of Representatives it was declared of very clear form it express to all which that reproach was suitable.
It was possible to be felt neither a minimum interest, nor no type of feeling by the problems of the country.
But instead of that, Ángela Wolke appeared this way: a policy very elevated that flees in the foreign policy and remains there without obtaining nothing in concrete.
An example: the prevention of the climatic change: it was praised very many to itself by the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but it does not say anything about how these goals must be made here in climate questions.
In general, this way to praise itself to same himself for two years the female leader of the Party of the Demócratocristiana Union has not been able to allow so much modestia.
Then one insists on expressions so that an impulse arrives at people.
And this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going away by the branches.
But in the kingdom of Ángela Wolke the inner problems are aparencias of little value.
The poverty of the children and the preoccupations by the workers with low wages?
To the only thing that it is dedicated it is to speak on that subject using subordinated orations.
It is impressive how many times it is mistaken when speaking when one is the supplement for the children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It begins to encounter "as if it had been in a unknown territory", when one was more concrete information.
The section attacks.
Both favorite, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in an heated debate of republican presidential precandidates of YouTube and now they must fear only a candidate of the outer part.
From a principle the tensions between the candidates already notice.
Mitt Romney reproached its adversary Rudy Giuliani who this one had turned to New York "a site of refuge for the illegal immigrants".
This one, on the other hand, responded with serious reproaches: "It meant that its own house was a" port "for the illegal ones". Giuliani answers ex--governador of Massachustes saying that it was the one who he used to the illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to the attacks: as until now the group of republicans he does not have a sure favorite the eight presidential precandidates take advantage of the debate in the Cnn, mainly to discredit their adversaries.
The small videos of 30 seconds, rollings by usarios of Internet that were sent to Youtube, do not have much content either.
"With this way of isolation we let to Hitler arrive at the power", that one was the reproach of John McCain to its opposing Rum Paul, the only one of the meeting that insisted on withdrawing of Iraq immediately.
Romney also receives many critics on the part of the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when it refuses to recognize as it tortures the "Waterboarding", an interrogation method, when letting suffocate to a person simulate his death.
The reactions of the public in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that meanwhile the most important subjects of the campaign are others, not only to the war in Iraq or the debates on the torture.
The public always applauded very hard when they praised the conservativos values and they denied the ascent of the taxes.
Thus it is possible to be seen better where they are the weaknesses of both favorites.
"Then I was mistaken", compungido Romney explains and asks pardon to the people and the public of the television being defending of the abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when they asked to him what thought on the literal interpretation of the bible.

They return the founders from Krautrock.
The more famous German band of years 70 follows its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As reestreno a copy became of "Live 1974" that was written in the best time of the band.
In those times they were already very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen to an official food caused the sensation.
Each one of them has in front of himself its small box, its cables and mainly its bellboys.
In means Dieter Moebius is seated that is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
To its left he is Michael Rother of 57 years, who has his laptop and the guitar.
To the right, watching of the audience, it is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years of age, that very is occupied with the Control Panel.
Each one contributes with its sounds, among them is even rate.
Sometimes, without no intention, these sounds become a music piece.
It seems that this does not bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for the enthusiastic ones of Krautrock was the fact that the Harmonia band returned to make music.
What there is to reveal here is the following thing: the questions accurately have shown that the name of the band resounded in the mind of people, but was not something as special as so that after 32 years the public surprised it as much.
But why the Germans cannot also applaud to their alive legend of the Seventies?
Mainly because the Kautrock ambiguity always more was valorized in England and the United States that in its own country.
When the entertainment industry granted a music prize "I throw" to the members of the band Dog 2003 of Colony by its work of life, in the room the surprised faces of the artists of pop German could be seen.
And when Network Hot Chili Peppers thanked for to the band the Düsseldorf und Neu, all opened the mouth with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent the time in the scene during the concerts of Network Hot Chili Peppers as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
The ignorance in their country and the recognition abroad, are a single thing.
A problem turns out to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times nonprofit a great effect in the public, nevertheless, obtained thanks to the others later.
A time ago Moebius and Roedelius they had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and already had a name, Cluster, that promised much fame.
They touched in the beginning in the cellar of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Later, for economic reasons, they worked with a company of music in Duesseldorf that was patronizada by a church.
During a time, Rother had a small job in Kraftwerk and later it worked of guitarist in the Neu band! It managed to improve the fame of this German band that in those times was too radical.
In 1973 Rother it followed the musicians of Cluster in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, that is a ruin of century XVI, they lived like refugees of the city.
The life way was less ideological than in Comune I, where Roedelius could be complained its position.
That was rather a life of full artist of surprises.
According to they say, a day appeared a pennant of association of song Harmonia de Ottenstein in the sweepings, that turned out to be good reputation for the art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the Harmonia name.
First albúm was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "Of Lux".
Although music was calm and simple, the band had financial problems.
The life as artist were not single to know itself itself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Somebody remembers that, in this recording almost 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed its desire to drive Harmonia and to make tests once in a while.
For Roedelius and Moebius this exigency is against the customs.
In 1975 the band announces its separation.
Rother finished put in esoterismo subjects and assured its existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revivió the Eighties and from that time has been more successful of the one than it had Harmonia.
The recording in direct of albúm in Griessmer, that is necessary to be thankful to Groenemeyer.
Its company of Grienland music was put as it puts to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it like alive music.
As the work of Roedelius, also the Neu band! again it was discovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as band takes place in the House of the Cultures of the World in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There he is Julian Close-woven part of a fishing net, the English, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There also the Dr Motte, the inventor of Loveparade is present.
This way, all the influences of Krautrock to the following pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position from a super-band, since he was empty.
The phrase of Brian Eno accompanied with special music fills the room: "This music is the only certain music, to her him partenece fúturo".
There are photos where it appears Harmonia with producers in a property.
The history of the development of the legend is in the projections of photos in black and white, where instruments with cables are seen.
At heart there are three veterans who began to improvise again.
They do not do nothing else that to fix the microphones to the organ and the battery to be able to produce extraordinary tones with the aid of the apparatuses of effects that had constructed with their own hands.
At the moment electronic music is as well as it had to be.
Three people who deepen in the technique.
But that does not change anything.
Under the direction of Morgenstern Barbarian, in a musical atmosphere tose, is whispered and at a good moment of emphasis Aaaaaaaah is sung "".
Krautrock already always was a term of English origin.
But never one was rock.
The origin of the sort in the blues, but in the schools of music (Dog), in technologies did not look for (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who shouts "68 here" also it is right, but now Harmonia conserves the calm.
In the scene it is reflected very well on which already it is evident.
Where it begins and where it finishes music?
That can break to one the nerves or give fast moments of luck.
To Richard Gere solely him lack more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are dedicated again to the war in the Balkan Mountains.
But both they did not have much conviction.
Or the concepts pay attention much to actions and tirotes or the two films are demasiando exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" cannot either help in this case.
At the beginning there was the good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the criminals military, continue hiding in the mountain of the Balkan Mountains, but indeed there, in the dark rear area during the war of Bosnia, the actor was discovered again Richard Gere.
Finally there were lost Vista to the most handsome man of the Eighties, because nobody wanted to see it after its pleasant papers and of little importance in the films for women and after many press conferences on the buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the argument most important to see perhaps the film "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes which persecutes" (Why nowadays the titles of the films must be so long and crazy).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the Vista: at heart, its paper of reporter in the war is the presentation of which Richard Gere could do, if the destiny and the industry of the cinema had not been so merciful with him. He was a man whose better times of the life already happened, that as a monument of the ruin of its decay conserved now until most of its enchantment.
"The Hunting Party", in spite of this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" that is the German production and also will be presented/displayed this week, turn out to be only one series of films without success on the war in the Balkan Mountains.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated briefly: German in Kosovo is two soldiers (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) whom they love to save a Serb of the snipers of Kosovo, one of them acts very fast and that also takes to him to that it falls in love with her.
The sense of the film loses by the actions and the shootings, although we celebrated that the Serbs are not presented/displayed once again like the only guilty.
The film is like the German series "Alarm to fuer Cobra 11" without freeway, but in situation military.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" it is possible to be investigated, because in fact never there was a good film on the war in the Balkan Mountains.
At another moment, with another director and another author of script (Richard Shepard in two positions), history on the American reporters in the war who go away to detect a criminal Serb military call "fox", probably could be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, histories are surprising similar: the small equipment goes away twice to the mountain to carry out something that cannot make the army and every time is a trip in madness.
A reason of the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at the beginning they present/display to us to Simon Hunt, to him to whom they simply do not let to him be a cynical one with heart.
No, the script also anticipates a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian that is going to kill soon.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from the reality, mainly when in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive rapidity obtain what NATO, the company and all the hunters of heads of the world could not obtain during five years, that went to capture the criminal military and to leave the musulmanos Bosnians so that they were taken revenge of a right form.
He is so bad, that they give desire to appeal to the international cut in the Hague based on crimenes con logica cinematica.
Nevertheless, the proposito of the film is, in fact, one profondamente human one.
Pelicula wants to condemn the fact that Karad?i? and Mladi? they even esten free, and stands out that the Americans and the French really do not estan worried to persecute them, because they have politicos adjustments among them.
Sometimes good and the bad thing is so similar, so that to one a very famous poem comes to him at the top from Brecht.
In this peoma one is a mask of an Asian demon: "In gandes wrinkles of its front I see, sharing the feelings with him, that last is to be bad".
In the films as "The Hunting Party" are also these demons but they demonstrate that hard she is to be good.
The problem consists not only of the sort of the films military in the Balkan Mountains.
Recently in a newspaper it published that all the films on Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It is possible also to be added that there has never been a good film on Africa of the South.
It is worth a rule almost always: when a star puts by a region of crisis or the minefields, soon he appears something as well as "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "To the other side of all borders" with Angelina sangrientes Jolie or "Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts happened in a brief space of time.
They must spend at least decades until Hollywood rolls a good film on holocausto having like example the film "the list of Schindler".
Some films already need more time. The classic ones like works on the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Jackett Metal" in their times were not celebrated unanimously like masterpieces.
Perhaps nowadays we know too much on world-wide conflicts, and for that reason in our times each slaughter (Massenmord) comes presented/displayed directly in two televisions in house.
And that is because the script authors do not have the smaller repairs (than it is necessary to be able) in narrating good histories.
"To be or to be" or "the great dictator" they were not in the end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know that so bad it was in fact the Nazi regime.
Perhaps one is not due to be a good person to roll a film.
Perhaps it is necessary to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with its sarcastic and distant glance of an artist.
When they asked him on parallelisms between its historical novel "Dictionary to him of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkan Mountains, it responded: "That only must to that some things never change".
The great cities always will be in danger, the men always are going to be assassinated cruel and in Yugoslavia always the war will reign.
Von Beust receives like answer the negative critic on the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received many critics of the policy and economy not to ask for the Olympic Games of the Summer.
Many want to continue fighting by the competitions in the section of aquatic sports.
But Beust remembers that there are to be realistic when considering the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, chief of a main directorate of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, showed Wednesday this resignation like "nongood for the economic location".
In the last time no other project in the great city fomented as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective the political, sport impulse could not be maintained at the same level".
Schmidt-Trenz demanded to the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new application long term "that talks about another time".
Wednesday mayor Ole von Beust maintained his declarations that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Olympic Games of the Summer were not made at least until year 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but that decides the German Federation of Olympic Sports", it says von Beust in the WELT ONLINE.
It sent to the decision of the Federation of sport (Sportbund) that is expected at the beginning of December, on the request of Munich for the Olympic Games of the winter of 2028.
"This preference means for us who in this period of time, which until now we thought to have until 2028, from the realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity".
In spite of everything, this dream did not finish for always, said von Beust.
The Federation of sport of Hamburg (HSB) laments the declarations of von Beut.
This gives the impression that in next the 25 Hamburg years it does not want to ask for the Olympic Games.
"It is too much soon to let clear the opportunity, if at this moment the plans are ruined", it said Wednesday Günter Ploß, the HSB director.
A resignation of the request is contradictory to the declaration of the head of the Senate that did in a reception in the occasion of the general meeting of the German public Federation of sport of the superior schools (adh).
There von Beust designated the request of Hamburg for Universiadas of 2015 not like "a substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Single the last week the Federation of sport of the superior schools named Hamburg like a candidate of the request.
The Fraction of the German Social-Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached to the Senate that did not take advantage of the so valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"During many years the Senate delayed with the development of the small district of Grasbrook, because this era in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses", affirmed Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social-Democratic Party (SPD).
Whereas the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olimpia for the small Grasbrook and soon the use of the constructed houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
Then, the request of Hamburg for the Olympic Games of the Summer of 2012 caused a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
They are not the wood boxes.
Who relates the Sweden terms wood and box, she thinks about Ikea, but she does not think about Andy Warhol.
Or yes?
At the moment the produced wood boxes in Sweden are like the shade that weighs on the work list of Warhol.
Most of ninety and the four Brillo-Box of "type" of this list are false.
After months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" put the doubt on the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of year 1968 of Andy Warhol, the museum Modern Museet of Stockholm made internal investigations and reached dissapointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", that the ex--director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to the museum Modern Museet, are false, and one hundred of the others of "type Stockholm", which they are in circulation in the market of the international art, almost are also.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relation between the artistic and patrocionadas productions.
In 1964 Warhol "Brillo-Boxes" created in New York his first, painted the wood boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that had soap dust cardboards "Brightness".
In agreement with Warhol, in the exhibition of their works of 1968 in the museum Modern Museet hundreds of cardboard Shine-boxes were exposed. These did not make Warhol (because of the expenses), but that were brought directly of the cardboard factory of "Brightness".
One was not works of art, but of units (that was only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol it allowed to produce in Sweden wood Shine-boxes, but they were not exposed in the museum Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times speak now of which almost fifteen boxes, that in that time entered the history of the art and of it auctions them like original of "Brillo-Boxes" of "type authorized Stockholm" by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were bought by more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that after which the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén made declarations false that in 1968 in Sweden they were produced and exposed almost one hundred of the wood boxes that Warhol left them him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in same 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and the exhibition in Saint Petersburg.
In this Warhol time already it had died 3 years ago.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the museum Modern Museet, also investigated six Brillo-Boxes property of museum and three of the Swedish property private who were made in 1968 in Stockholm. First their tight platas were imprimieron and esmerilaron and later were painted you to the oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of copies of the year 1990 sample that the painting was applied with a roller without printing the tight platas directly. In addition one is not the oil painting, but that of the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be eliminated of the official list of Brillo-Boxes de Andy Warhol", say Lars Nittve, the director of the museum Modern Museet and add that if the Commission of Authentication "Andy Warhol Art" in New York will not reach some conclusion, the museum Modern Museet will classify these six boxes like the copias/objetos of exhibition ".
In Julio the Commission of Authentication already announced of formal way that accepts these "serious accusations" in which it is boxes of soap dust.
But from that moment everything remained there in absolute silence.
