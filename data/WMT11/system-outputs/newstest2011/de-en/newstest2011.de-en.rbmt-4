What she is supposed to do, the SSD? Neither the Czech social democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, yet the "cake shop."
The new councillors of the capital from the rows of the SSD will have to overcome obviously certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues anyway from the ODS in the Prager council and in the city representation.
Member of the new council "knocked" the newspaper Aktuáln.cz out of the SSD once a little bit as they dominate the notorious slang which was established in the last years in which the present coalition partners were in Prague at the oar.
The coded vocabulary, that in the passed era of chief burgomaster Pavel Bém of the Prager was introduced political elite, is to some of the best known protagonists, borrowed situations and Causae.
Surprisingly showed, that the new councils with respect to those ones these new concepts a little in the dark grope.
They claim that at least.
"Who Voldemort is"?
"No presentiment."
"I am rather a newcomer to the Prager politics," reacted Lukás Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, onto the test of the "godfather vocabulary."
But also the councillor Karel Bezina - a political veteran - reacted to similar manner.
For example onto the concept "golf hole."
"That is the only expression of those which you present to me here which I use occasionally."
"Otherwise I do not hold much of slang."
From the vocabulary, that the day leaf of Aktuáln.cz in this year's June in front of the choice congress of the ODS had published, the editorial staff pecked six concepts out, particularly such that are notorious united with the Prager municipal council.
The social democrats should the concepts "Voldemort," "biggest Prager" golf hole," "to go into the cake shop," "Bull nape, Betrayal of the capital" and "verblechen" define.
Three Prager councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prager school being - promised his participation in the conversation first indeed, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prager school being - did not pick up then the listener once, however.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused the test from the beginning.
"These things are to me regardless and as the Middle Class democrats under each other talk, I do not judge that."
"For me it is important how we get on within the framework of our programs" it countered.
Pointed out as already, Lukás Kaucký would supposedly not have recognized in the above-mentioned headline, that of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex chief burgomaster Bém, Roman Janousek is the speech.
The concept "Voldemort" does not say anything to Kaucky at all in that and the only concept which he guessed during the test correctly was "the biggest Prager golf hole."
"That is the tunnel Blanka," Kaucký says added for the security, however, still: "But I rather know that from the newspaper."
And jocular: "I will have to do presumably a language course."
The "golf hole" is deciphered to Lukás Plachý correctly then not only by matador Karel Bezina, but also by the councillor for environmental questions as a tunnel Blanka.
Both social democrats also know, however, for whom the concept Voldemort stands and foresees Lukás Plachý even, where this figure is to be found and through that also, what means it "to go into the cake shop."
"I believe, that is, to go into some Prager gastronomy company," it is quite close to that to Plachý at the puzzle's solution if one knows that it at that around the seat Firmen deals with Janouseks.
In agreement with Bezina he declares, however, to rather have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper than that this vocabulary would be particular to him.
It seems among the social democrats not to give any similarly adopted slang in fact to judge according to the test participants.
"I asked also to my colleagues, but obviously there is really not something like that with us."
"We calls us with the name, occasionally we use also abbreviations or nicknames," the chairperson of the Prager says SSD Petr Hulínský - mentioned "Hulda" by his party comrades casually.
"In the school I was mentioned Bíza (Birch), but I do not know, whether me also my colleagues so nominal," Karel Bezina betrays us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuáln.cz tried out the name and see there - it functions.
The "grandpa" or little is councillor Weinert in a friendly manner in a friendly manner for the party comrades the "altos'," the representative Miroslav Poche that made attentive before the choices through machinations during the party Sponsoring on themselves is mentioned "Igráek" (Czech Lego figure confessed) by some colleagues.
Nicknames are so the only one which the social democrats admit in the internal party usage.
Hulínský does not like it supposedly if one mentions him "Hulda," but Deník Aktuáln.cz registered still another nickname of the Prager chairperson.
His nickname "Doctor of the truncheon-rights" has to do alleged with Petr Hulínský acquiring his title of Doctor juris at the Bratislaver police academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "hexes" and handed over a brochure
Women who are stamped as hex in Burkina Faso normally show some common social features.
You rather belong to the older generation, they do not find any work - for example for sanitary reasons, they are single and do not have any children.
If one of these women "becomes" the witch, she is isolated severely, in this way they the rest of the village not dangerous can become.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"Also young and healthy women have this saved since they help with the work and "give birth to children" a nun describes the situation that takes care in the capital of the west-African Burkina Faso state in a special home of more than a hundred women that were expelled by their communities.
The local government decided now, to proceed against this abnormal "social measure."
And a brochure that is supposed to stop the "witch pursuit" handed over for this reason.
The thing has, however, a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can not read," the newspaper "derStandard" referred to the dilemma of the written clarification.
To be accused of the witchery is, however, also in other African countries gang und gäbe.
In Ghana, the neighbor country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year old Ammy Hemmahová was tormented by three women and two men to death - they poured petroleum over it and simply lit it.
Also the servers' BBC reported about this incident among other things.
The culprits said, however, the thing would have been only a concurrence of unhappy circumstances.
According to your version oil ignited which is used to ritual anointings.
And indeed, after the group attempted "to drive out" "a bad spirit" from the woman.
The people support the isolation of "hexes" here without regard for their education.
"The standard one" summoned a 42-year old entrepreneur to that from Burkina Faso: "Mug gutters of human souls are formerly as today a danger," he said.
While the government is making at least an effort in Burkina Faso for defusing the witch-hunt, the president himself mixed the gambianische president in the last year tidily.
"Präsident Yahya Jammeh provoked a monstrous witch-hunt after the death of his aunt since these supposedly had part onto their deaths and would attempt now to kill also the president even through black magic."
"It called Schamane for this purpose from the near Guinea to help that in company women randomly arrested by policemen, soldiers and the lifeguard of the president and men carried off violently from gambianischen villages and brought onto the farm of the president" in Kanilai" the organization Amnesty International mentioned in their report.
On the farm the incarcerated people were forced, a decoction from plants with hallucinogenic effect drink, that but also intestine and kidney problems caused.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
First due to the international pressure the almost a thousand were released prisoners again.
A tenant of Bakala: It gives a good heat indeed in the stove - in spite of that higher rent pays
An older thickset man just leaves the client center of the society RPG Byty the "coal baron" Zdenk Bakala, the tallest private owner of flat lets for rent in Czechia.
Under the arm a folder with three new rent contracts to three apartments: for the own one and the apartments of his daughters and his son who serves just a prison sentence.
The rent was just increased to all three within the framework of the so-called "deregulation."
Instead of 3500 crowns of month rent the son is supposed to fork out 4100 crowns in the next year for a 2-room-apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And over there there is in the apartment water not once fluently warm and must heat one in a simple coal stove," he bets annoyedly on the new rent contract of the son to whose signature he has a proxy with the finger.
"But what - signed have I, declared it half detunes and half gives up."
The civil union BytyOKD.cz that referred to the new rent conditions as "incorrect and immoral" guesses to the tenants, the new contracts not simply to sign and to wait up to the 7th December at which proposes to publish it some instructions as one proceeds against such contracts.
But the man beckons only off.
"One says this, that other that," it does a dark face.
The region Ostrava becomes like this to the big "deregulation lab."
After New Year this deregulation awaits most flat lets for rent in Czechia whose tenants up to now do not pay any market-just rent.
Aktuáln.cz decided therefore on going to this "lab" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havíov is to one of four in the region Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday breaking full.
To stand now next to the door the bodyguards of a security agency and with it a call device.
"Rents in 2011," a specific feeling-field shines so on the Touchscreen.
In a word touchedly and already the device spits out a number note.
Hardly we did not decipher the number "in 157" and already it bleeps on the big display at the cover of the waiting room.
Half a second later it is up to one.
A little later an older married couple enters the waiting room in order to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room is not meant apparently at all for the new rent.
Most people are here in order to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and similar.
From middle November the envelopes with the new rent contracts flutter to most tenants of the in total 44.000 apartments of the port folio of the RPG in the region Ostrava into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests a rent increase of approx. 15 to 38 percent to them in the writings.
The specific counter for the new rents in the client center is since the 18th November opened.
"The action runs a little across a week, that is, that is first the beginning," the ladies answer to hesitation behind the counter after a moment when the "client" turns out as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas former miner apartments are an explosive topic.
Before the choices the parliament vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek coming from Ostrava had picked up this topic from the SSD quite lauthals, no miracle, that the newspapers are full of that today.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not once ne besch. they could "exchange" toilet glasses," the at the beginning mentioned man makes himself for air.
Until now outcrop according to the employees before all pensioner at the counter in order to convince oneself whether they really receive the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
February rent reduced into the pleasure of one half are supposed to come also the other tenants, that sign the new rent contract up to the 15th December.
Until now "Deregulation counter" is everything else, however, in Havíov, than overloaded from demands.
"From the 360 clients of yesterday only about 40 to 50 were here because of the rent in the year 2011," reckon the clerks.
RPG offers in this case both on their web pages, as also blackboards individual rent agreements, where it appears necessary.
If the rent parties should agree not on the new rent, however, it is defined by an independent court.
"That is not supposed to be a threat, but that is as information about those ones only to understand possible and completely legitimate legal approach," declares RPG on his web pages.
"Here nobody goes in court," thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center gives to her at least in part right.
"I have 13.000 (Crowns) pension, from that 5.000 remain for me for the food," where I should "get" the money for a court quarrel, he thinks.
Nevertheless then the employee becomes unsure.
"Seeing once."
"Herr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they are not supposed to sign and so the people wait still off," she admits consider.
The adjusted rent ends in the biggest part of Czechia to New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing height of the rents does not suffice once for the maintenance of the living-ground" Pavel Klimes argues, the director of the apartment Portfolios of the society RPG Byty and - just the disregard of the apartment ground criticized by the angry tenants is in opinion of the house-owners the main reason for the rent increase.
During RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the taken rents four billion into the apartments could invest, in the four years of 2011 to 2014 it is supposed to be to 5,2 billion.
On the grossformatigen LCD display at the cover opposite the armchairs in the waiting room of Havíov a few information in a red way radiant emerge in between again and again.
"The rent increases in the year 2011 around 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"Always this means at most 7,50 CZK per square meter and month," is to read on the LCD monitor.
Only near 400 apartments from the port folio of RPG the rent increases about 38 percent to itself.
"In these cases it is a question of the rise of extremely small rent prices from 19,66 CZK per square meter," RPG argues.
Near 2600 apartments the rent remains in the next year on same height.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not push up the rents suddenly, but occurs in a step by step way within four and eight years.
What more - that imposes enterprises a further obligation: All gains from the rent increase (see diagram) the enterprise wants to put again into the apartments, particularly into heat savings - into new windows and into the thermal insulation.
But - with first priority people that sign the agreements on the rent increase are supposed to benefit to those ones these.
The architects saw - to the office also a kindergarten belongs
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the enterprise Arch.Design.
But who would expect here already a minikindergarten, with everything something for this purpose belonged: colorful walls, creative furniture, an amount toy and even a miniplayground on the exterior terrace.
This kindergarten is available since last year to the employees of Arch.Design.
Avriopoint charged the project planning and architecture office Arch.Design whose studios a whole series of constructions in a more of repute way Brünner come from from the first drafts for the new building with the premises for his company mini kindergarten.
In wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the baby boom age and it suited to the company at that that the Projektantinnen and architects return as quickly as possibly onto their job.
Together with the possibility, it shortens to work, the kindergarten is a further bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to his employees in the draft of their social program.
The construction engineer and architect have it so more easily to bring their pretentious profession and the child welfare under a hat.
The minikindergarten is an initial idea of the employees (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they succeeded in extracting supporting-money of the European Union and the ministry for work and social one for their project.
The company internal minikindergarten is financed to humane resources and to employment politics from means of the European Social Ground and from the state budget through the operation program to the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (Subsidies at the level of 2 8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and the equipment could be gotten and for the duration of 2 years is worried for qualified personnel and for the company.
According to the exhaustion of the promotion means (2 years) the society Arch.Design is obliged to keep on practicing the minikindergarten 3 more years onto own costs.
The preparation of this project used a whole year at which the society Economy Rating gave active help during the request handling.
Of the children takes care whole-active qualified personnel - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, children without age-moderate restrictions can go to the kindergarten although most of them are more than three years old.
And since it is a question of a mini-kindergarten at that, only 5 children may be simultaneously present, change, however, the day over several children mutually off.
The kindergarten company is synchronized with the need of the parents flexible, the children of all employees have the same rights with respect to the use of the kindergarten - without regard for the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is a question of individual education and care, nevertheless the program contents are comparable in the mini-kindergarten with the general-purpose program of the preschool education.
The children do only not play here, particularly excellent instruction is offered to them - of basic findings up to the preschool instruction, incidentally they also still learn English.
The classroom is endowed not only with toy and creative games, but also with a computer which is available to the children.
Which more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
The parents can fling at any time a look onto the children and so the stress is dropped while fetching late the children from a far remote kindergarten.
The parents use therefore their working time more productively.
No miracle, that also natural and loyal employer Arbeitnehmer-Beziehungen develop here.
Arch.Design joined so under the Czech companies that offer clear Benefits with the recruitment of new employees that are family-friendly and confirm their personnel-marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinated also still after 100 years. Have a look at the Interieure of fun
The roof seems as the back of a prehistoric saurian, fish mouths torn open are the stairs as the spine of a dinosaur and the Balkone.
That is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants the house with his organic forms got the nickname "bone house."
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and mosaic's, that facades reminding of scales and omnipresent soft lines, all this are typical features for the Jugendstil of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with marvellous lines, gentle colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings.
Before in the case of more exact seeing one does not notice that all of geometry, rhythm and order thought over is governed.
In the night the whole facade seems even more plastic, more dramatic and the specific Anleuchtung still intensifies the shine of the colors.
The same swing-full lines and cost forms also the interior of the house master.
Wood in a wavelike way shaped even copies the window frames, rails, adornment elements of doors, spyholes and strips.
The house Batlló in the quarter of Eixample at the animated shopping street Passeig de Grácia no. 43 arose through the reconstruction of a house from the year 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese exported.
The reconstruction used two years and was finished in 1906.
The investor, the prosperous industrial Josep Batlló, insisted initially on the demolition of the old one and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís onto an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
Antoni Gaudí did only not project the apartment house Casa Batlló, however.
He cooperated in this case with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Just on his drawing board the decorations arose for the representative apartment of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics at the facade was his idea.
On the organization of the facade worked, however, also numerous further creators and artists with.
The common work at the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fertile cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
So Jujol participated also in the construction of Gaudís Haus Casa Milá in the park Gueell in which there are also further works of Antoni Gaudí.
Already shortly after his finishing "Knochenhaus" got the house of the local inhabitants of his organic forms because of the nicknames.
Other in turn it called because of the specific window opening mechanism the "yawning house."
One also says very above on the building the sword of the holy Georg is the patron's represented from Catalonia.
But also further sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí projected a central heating system unique for the former time with ventilation channels and typical chimneys for the house.
A little bizarrely their 45-degree-inclination already seems.
During his work Gaudí ignored all former design specifications consistently and could not be disconcerted by any means from these.
For start of building he obtained the corresponding planning and building permission indeed from the city but the information done by it over the planned reconstruction were so vague, that the city fathers were two years later so horrified during the finishing from the result that they demanded remedy.
The councillors also disapproved themselves among other things on the construction with his pillars intervening even in the public sidewalk.
To changes more did not come it, however, quite the opposite - only fifteen days according to the related request of the quarter Josep Batlló made a request for the permission of the rental of the two höchstgelegenen storeys of the house - and it was given to him promptly.
The house-owner himself moved in in the lower floors.
There was a society parlor in the gallery in the 2nd stick, there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment in the third stick.
The ground floor was leased to a jeweller.
The entire six storey building ran through some stairs to up to the roof terrace.
Through the fundamental elements of the reconstruction all right angles were removed and straight lines and replaced by bent and swung walls.
Gaudí worked, however, also with a modern draft to the mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can completely be combined through the opening of the parlor doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably without having to renounce a certain intimacy in the case of more confidential conversations.
The house received also a quite unusual roof and two more storeys through Gaudís reconstruction except for a new facade.
Impressive is also Gaudís game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the inner court is covered and the patios.
The game of these two colors gives a maximum of light to all floors of the house.
He shut the principle in this case in a simple way Wear, that white reflects the light better as if Farben that absorbs the sunlight on the contrary for this purpose darkens.
Everyone can go to the house Casa Batlló which was incorporated in 2005 into the world heir list of the Unesco today.
In the first stick the most spacious and most splendid apartment is made accessible to the public.
The house-owners decided only in the year on this step and this on the occasion of the 150.Geburtstags of the famous creator.
When one found, that this a quite profitable business is, one retained the inspections, yes one also bulged it wider common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace from.
The price for the inspection of the monument is not, however, a cardboard stem, it is 16,50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist identity cards get 20 percent of reduction.
This amount surpasses the admission charges to other Gaudí-constructions in the city.
Who would like to become acquainted with the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon turrets should attempt, to close friendship with one of the house inhabitants and to visit it at home.
The correct mattress and the correct bed rust? Women have other wishes than men
Not the most fabulous bed frame, but the quality of the sunbathing area - therefore mattress and rust form the good bed.
These must complement themselves harmoniously, however, in order to be raked to the wishes of the concrete user.
During the selection many things play a role - the weight, the size, the health state and last but not least also the sex of the sleeper.
Also the interior in which Matratze and rust have to subordinate themselves is just as important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house in which regularly does not give a good heat latex mattresses are not well suitable since they need much longer in order to become warm.
In addition they are clearly heavier than usual polyurethane-mattresses are.
And - they should be turned regular.
If indeed they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the core and still lie on a firm plate for this purpose, moisture builds up: It is not therefore impossible that mold forms itself under it.
During the choice it plays of course also a role what one is used to.
Who was longer time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft shift are usual, will be able to become accustomed to a low mattress with hard surface heavily.
"Presumably all ice hockey players that came back from the NHL complained with me, that they can not sleep here more correctly."
"They simply need a soft shift for their mistreated shoulders, heels and hips from Visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I recommend these among other things also to diabetic people who suffer from a trouble of the nervous system so that they can receive the information badly of the hinges and the skin," declares Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes on upholstered furniture.
Therefore I got already before years to many ice hockey players, however, also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Heute is not this any problem more, because the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico offer such mattresses among other things."
And one does absolutely not have to be a famous ice hockey player in order to learn to estimate the advantages of the Visco-Schaums.
This "miracle" actually very simply functions.
The foam optimalisiert his hardness and form according to the absorbed heat, differently said he cuddles up downright to the warm body at.
Anywhere it does not press, in the night one does not roll over as after a difficult fight.
One sleeps simply much better.
The viskölastische foam in addition offers also protection from Dekubitus (Wound fire).
During the choice of the mattress size one should still add the length of the soles of the foot to the height, therefore approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Man as woman that is large onto the 180 cm need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
At least 90 cm of chaise longue width should be available to each of the sleepers, together therefore 180 cm.
Near single beds, for example with singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the sake of the comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise the following rule of thumb is valid for the ideal bed width: "When one lies on the back," still enough place should "be" for the slightly bent arms," Ing. guesses Helena Prokopová, the guild master of the upholsterers and interior decorators that dedicates herself to the problems of the healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture already for years and presents this topic also on technical schools.
Near a double bed everyone needs an own rust and his own mattress, to look out, however, during the purchase so that the mattresses are high also now.
Otherwise nothing else remains, to mount as the rusts in different height and that is not for a long time possible near every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, from that at least three centimeters should be allotted to the form shift and the detailed cushion.
"With the hand or while putting down one must not sense the feathers in any case," Helena Prokopová warns.
Every mattress requires a specific rust type.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and pad as Siam twins grown together do not have to search anything in the bedroom.
These mattresses can not be ventilated and one can not wash the purchase, which today yes already gang und gäbe is.
And since one loses sweat in a single night between 0,2 to 0,75 l is, clear, that the mattress after five to seven years becomes slow to a gigantic (and were blocked sieve).
Also therefore specialists refuse advertising slogans, that near mattresses a lifespan of up to 25 years, to promise even lifelong guarantee.
Every thing has their if and Aber.
And therefore a practical council of the traders: Near mattresses of 120 or 140 cm of width one should not shun from the hygiene of the washable, strip-off purchases, nevertheless it is recommended to use a mattress schooner which one can remove easily and wash.
Even if mattress covers with Rundumreissverschluss are today normally manufactured so that one gets two halves after the opening (immensely important for the scrubbing-process and the washing machine size!) the manipulation with bigger mattresses mutet, particularly only taken out, often as the different fight between David and Goliath at.
Do they have a firm plate in the bed instead of a rust?
From that in this way!
Or at most for a bed for disliked guests and for a single night.
Also so they should put ventilation holes on the plate more gladly (provided that already none are in that) and to use mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm least height with so-called bag feather core and detailed cushion.
Polyurethane-mattresses do not belong onto such a pad.
For grilles not adjustable with 14 to 18 spring contact strips (Lamellae) latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (where appropriate also combinations of latex and coconut palms), always rusts with a greater slat number are paid in this case, therefore of 28 and more spring contact strips from, with Lordosenstütze in the lumbar vertebra field and the possibility to adjust the slat hardness.
Onto adjustable lamella rusts no mattresses with feather skeleton belong since they do not react to the ergonomic change.
Next to the attitude of the starch of the spring contact strips also specific flexible shoulder modules are offered.
At that it works in order to push in a specific fixing of the spring contact strips that it facilitates the spring contact strips or really so too verwinkeln, that they facilitate the punctual sinking in of the shoulder of the sleeper.
In particular for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers which started using Soft zones for the shoulder field near "gentleman mattresses."
Also onto the ladies is thought - one grants them these soft zones in the hip area.
For most pretentious customers point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rusts with point-elastic contact-pads with so-called multitorsion resilience are certain.
The pressure is distributed onto several points through which the tension is reduced.
But - when one to the correct mattress and used a bad (too large and plump) pillow correct rust, most advantages disappear again.
Also here a rule of thumb: the pillow is supposed to support the head, his tops should reach only up to the shoulders so that the deltoid muscles can relax.
Ideal appears therefore 50 x 60 cm big cushion, as for example the Scandinavians like it.
In the side situation the pillow (together with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses had something with the former (filled with hay) straw bags nevertheless common.
Modern manufacturers always use frequent natural materials or at least their additions.
Also near mattresses the new charm word is called "Bio."
Instead of oil raw materials one uses increasingly more frequently naturelle oils to the production of polyurethane foams - for example castor-oil plant and soya oil.
Soja is used presumably by all known manufacturers.
"Are called Bio near mattresses, that their core withstands of materials in that of natural origin," declaredly Petr Vasíek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials become but also during the production of mattress covers uses - one of the first was in this case aloe Vera.
One can treat oneself, however, also on microcapsules which spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance while sleeping.
Also here one does a difference between Mann and woman.
While with the men a "chilling" essence is being used from birch leaves, so that the mattress cover absorb the heat and it can cool off the body, the purchases have for effect "warming" women.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate the blood circulation, the weaker sex becomes while sleeping therefore wohlig warm.
And the present favorites?
Mattresses of cold foam (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible).
More-zone-mattresses that know exactly, where there are head, Hüfte and heels, arise through the combination of the different starch (Hardness) of cold foams and Visco-foams.
For a high-quality mattress one has to fork out, however, 7000 crowns and more.
Health mattresses are burdened with smaller value added tax, however, usually since they are regarded as medical aids.
As first Czech enterprise Gumotex became this advantage zuteil.
One sees to economize on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
Occasionally there are special offers of manufacturers and traders who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
So the brand Magniflex offers the mattress to Duofreeze with Visco-foam Memory quilted in the purchase for 11.990 CZK.
One gets the second free for this purpose.
It was the material Tempur which introduced the era of the viskölastischen expanded plastics with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic speed.
No miracle, nevertheless they were developed for the NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the starts.
Tempur becomes with heat soft, in cool environment it consolidates in turn.
So adjusts it to the human body perfectly and distributes the body pressure over optimal manner.
It is not therefore only ideal to the prevention of pressure fire, but it increases the sleep comfort generally.
Viskölastische expanded plastics are supposed to provide, however, not only near mattresses, but also with other health products as uses e.g. near specific foot cushions that the legs and the vessels relief.
Native manufacturers use for example the expanded plastics Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
To want parents more and more human being invigilators, in order to have the Kids under control
The fear around the own children increases and so parents consider more and more to control it by GPS.
The system which was invented initially for the search after cars can locate people just as well indeed, which would be helpful also in such cases, as recently during the disappearance of the nine year old Anika Janatková without a trace.
The device is currently about as big as a cigarette packet is but already soon it might not be larger, as a wristwatch.
The case of the disappeared Anika terrified many people and so they consider to means and ways look-out to protect their children better.
Also for the price of an influence of their privacy.
"We make an effort for saying to all that it is not at that of spying a question under any circumstances but around an effective means to reduce the probability that it results in the tragedy," Petr Pilin mentions from the society macro because, one of the suppliers of GPS fault-locating units on the Czech market.
"I admit that it can result in the abuse of such devices on an individual basis for example if one puts it to somebody into the bag without his knowing about that, but we did not have to record up to now such a case to any."
Most customers really buy it for themselves from safety reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion the child should always know, however, for which purpose the "box" is used and how one uses it in an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Boková refers, however, to a child simply ridding it himself from his if it does not like to bear such a thing.
"Also very much small children show great creativity if it is a question of losing certain things on purpose if they do not want to be controlled."
"Already the mobiles woke at the beginning great expectations with the parents, but they can be switched off just as easily for itself, as these new invigilators," Ms Boková means.
In your opinion it is also controversial whether such an equipment helps in the case of an attack in fact.
"In the case of planned kidnappings the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics with themselves with which it could be located."
"Today it is the mobile."
"If such invigilators found wider use, they would also search these since their sale would be accompanied from massive advertising surely."
"In these cases the criminals of the police are always a step ahead," thinks the psychologist.
She adds, however, that similar devices can be absolutely helpful at a sudden attack through a pedophile.
According to Roberta ech of the society RC Monitoring, the location services both for cars when also for persons offers the existence of such a device can help also, when it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be put indeed so that the respective position announces it in certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, the last position of the affected person is available at least."
"Near more expensive devices even a clinometer is integrated, that is if one falls down and keeps on being calm the device sends a warning immediately under specification of the position," gentleman claims ech.
In his opinion similar services would keep up also intelligent mobile telephones navigation perform, one needs to record only a specific software.
The problem of the current fault-locating units consists in it being a question of devices at that either in matchbox size that resemble supporters or around smaller mobiles.
Always the danger that one loses it exists so.
Mr Pilin of the macro because follows tests one therefore in the present devices that looks like normal digital clocks.
"That has the advantage that the possible assailant does not have to recognize at all that it is a question of a supervision and/or location device.
"Or he notices this first after certain time what gives a time projection to the police" he adds.
Regardless, into which direction the development goes - there to bracelets or supporters, always the same technology is used in this case, as during the vehicle location.
Therefore around the combination of location function with the aid of the GPS system (just the same as at the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile telephone that the current position announces.
The army has so many fuses, that one could completely wrap around Czechia you to hold, however, only two years
The Czech Army bought 445 kilometers fuses, to be ignited with Sprengsätze.
Per year before the Ministry of Defense had provided with already 224 kilometers onto the army warehouses fuse.
It is already calming know, that the armed forces for 225 years have worried.
The problem is only the durability of the fuses - two, at most, however, four years.
The army bought the fuses of the limited company STV Group, a. see for foolish 40 million crowns.
In his reason for the purchase of this tremendous amount fuse the general staff MF DNES answered, the soldiers would consume annually fuse onto the 60 kilometers.
According to the investigations of army pyrotechnists, that spoke TO MF DNES about that, it follows from this specification that the whole army would have to complete an extremely intense pyrotechnic training annually - of all generals and officers of the army command, up to the secretaries and cleaning ladies.
Defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only so the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers fuses could be justified to some extent.
This length corresponds after all to 25.000 detonations.
However, these army supplies would suffice for more than ten years also so.
When, however, still the old rule of experts is valid, that for the training of every new regular soldier two meters completely suffice fuse, then the army got a calming stock through these new purchases - also from the viewpoint of the climbed need of the engineer and special units - for the already mentioned 225 years.
In this case soldiers of the quickness use brigade complained recently with the defense minister Vondra, they would not have almost any cartridges for small arms anymore so that firing-exercises are strongly restricted because of the missing means.
To completely be silent from the pants lack.
"I do not understand either why they buy such vast quantities fuses from us."
But finally that is their decision, they will know already what they need it to."
"For us the army is a good customer, that we would like to come as traders largely towards," the marketing manager of the STV Group Jan Dcký says.
Jan Pejsek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defense establishes the purchase with that Hunderter kilometer fuse, the army would have provided itself with this "ammunition" so at least for ten years.
Jan Dcký of the STV Group even speaks, however, only of two years only from a four year long service life of the fuses and police and army pyrotechnists.
"In the case of perfect storage also the four mentioned years are presumably possible," adds one of them who, however, wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of the criticism as a soldier at the army.
After the service life any ammunition must be tested thoroughly whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the life of the soldiers.
These tests are not, however, for nothing, but they cost further money.
A further argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers fuse.
"You cost us sixty percent less, as the last year delivery of 244 kilometers," speaker Pejsek informs us of the point of view of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Only for the comparison: The annual consumption of fuses of pyrotechnists of the police that liquidates ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet brother army does not exceed hardly for already some years 1.500 meters.
And the police order always only such amounts of this ammunition which can still consume it before course of the service life.
Already because of the security of the pyrotechnists, in addition one holds the possibility to flexible purchases so more modern and thus also reliable fuses' open.
The Ministry of Defense has anyhow gigantic problems during the liquidation Zehntausender tons of ammunition from times of the Warschauer contract, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovak nation army prepared itself for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnists, who spoke TO MF DNES, the same problem expects the Czech armed forces in a few years during the liquidation Hunderter kilometer old fuses, that bought it today so "favorably."
Until today the contacts which I gained thanks to the competition come to me sitedly
Lukás Pytloun with the sale helped the victorious placement in the competition "Small entrepreneur of the year" the franchise of his hotel.
Winner of the last age-group of the competition "Small entrepreneur of the year" became Lukás Pytloun from Liberec.
The history of his success seems as a film scenario.
Lukás Pytloun traveled gladly.
First abroad it became conscious to him that good overnight stay possibilities to reasonable prices are missing in Liberec.
It arose from the savings of his vacation works abroad and with the aid of a bank loan a dilapidated house with five apartments.
If one considers that he was a college student then in the sixth semester, this was surely a courageous venture.
"The former price-quality-relation annoyed me and so I attempted to undertake something against that," says Lukás Pytloun.
He let out the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He invested the whole profit immediately again in the house which it encircled with 54 beds afterwards step by step to the retirement.
Since then he succeeded only in seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec in opening four pensions, two style-just restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most convenient of them was until recently the four star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel."
This year a further first-class hotel joined.
"Just we signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to whom we sold our franchise draft and have further prospective customers at the franchise of the Pytloun hotels already reported," the entrepreneur says number One of the last year.
"The victory just had "great part of this license sale for the operation of hotels in the competition "Entrepreneur of the year," Mr Pytloun matches recognizing in addition.
The victory imported to him greater fame popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"The people recognized me on the street, often they even subsequently congratulated me and I must say that did correctly well," he remembers.
I really recommend all who want to create something to participate in this competition.
One does not need to win either now, every viewing is good.
He says that it profits from the contacts and acquaintances until today to which otherwise at all it would not have come.
"With some people who I met thanks to the competition I maintain until today regular business relations."
The fame combined with the success beats in his opinion also a little onto each of his employees low.
And there he wears the seventy.
"I notice with them greater loyalty and pride on their being a part of something to which general recognition zuteil becomes."
I do also really not regard this only as personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of us all."
"My name moved only something into the foreground," thinks Lukás Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had it in Farmet
The victory euphoria was dissolved quickly of the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his consistency Farmet has the worst thing behind itself.
Karel Žárský, the owner of the firm of Farmet, took the price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone Firma the year in the last age-group towards.
The jury acknowledged then the efforts with which it stamped an enterprise from the small tool construction in eská Skalice from the ground that hundreds of millions of turnovers does.
"I can say that this assessment encourages not only me myself, but also all my employees and confirmed our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet the effort to do something useful stood.
And when then the state offered his father Karel Žárský as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists a small workshop to the lease, he did long not hesitate, his career in the company in which it was until then busy made whistle and an own company for the production of plastic tubs founded with a few comrades of his father.
Short time later it began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they are to the tallest manufacturers of automatic presses in whole Central Europe climbed up.
But first through the success in the mentioned competition and his Medialisierung it kicked in also into the consciousness of the non-compartment public.
"Not only, that our customers perceive the brand Farmet now clearly more intensely, to be able to cooperate with a company that achieved the maximum success in their country, also our foreign partners began the circumstance to attach bigger value," Karel Žárský says.
The last year did not stand at Farmet, however, only in the sign of the victory euphoria.
The assessment went out of 2009 from the economical results of the enterprise in the year 2008 and a part.
And in just 2009 the most difficult year was for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, that then still less the citizens, but particularly enterprise shook, reached just their climax - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and to restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"We could not escape this situation of course either."
"The turnovers fell off about 40 percent, we had to restrict the production and catch even to dismissals," declares Karel Žárský
A viable enterprise must take also such unpopular measures sometimes.
Succeeded, however, in getting the situation into the grip and holding the company in the black also when with smaller profits, than before the crisis.
At one the enterprise was not willing to do cutbacks - with the investments in the research and development.
"From the subsidy we built a research and training center, we confirmed our presentation on international fairs and we gained main prices in the case of domestic exhibitions," says Žárský.
Everything shows that we had overcome the crisis.
The turnovers also increase again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy of the victory - however in quieter atmosphere, Karel Žárský makes be orientated."
An opinion poll which tidies up senseless rules
The opinion poll around the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneur competition for the fourth time.
Some senseless rules it succeeded already, to obtain from the world.
The duty became the doubtful winner of the next age-group of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the year," to get documents onto authorities, to be available the online ones.
So more than one third decided of not completely four thousand voice-giving entrepreneurs.
So the social security administration demanded a paper departure from the commercial register, even if the official would have been able to call it up through two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll this is changed now.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will not demand in future in the case of controls any departures from the commercial register anymore from social security payers," mentioned the speaker of SSZ Jana Buraová.
It is sense and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the year" to take all rules and orders under the magnifier to have to be given to the entrepreneurs in Czechia and to disconnect the senseless ones.
This is a part of an entrepreneur competition this year already for the fourth time, that of the tsch. Economic newspaper (HN) is organized and delighted popularity increasing in public.
When in the last year onto the three thousand persons at the vote involved, it was this year already four thousand.
No miracle, because still there is an amount of legal duties that only and only for this purpose serve for hindering the enterprise activity.
"What affects for example the number of the income tax forms, we take a front rank in the world one," Karel Havlíek of the union of small and centrally located enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic notices.
The simplification of the entrepreneurial activity is in the last years the proclaimed objective of all governments.
In the comparison to the world the situation hardly improved in Czechia, however.
According to information of the World Bank Czechia takes the 74th rank with respect to the enterprise conditions, in the comparison to the previous year one around eight places worse placement.
The competition absurdity of the year was called out for the first time in the year and happens every year according to same scenario.
Everyone can announce administrative and bureaucratic nonsense of April up to the copy deadline of the competition at the end of September.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for the registration. For that the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "antiprice" and the public makes vote on the Internet on the web pages www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It the absurdity that gets most voices triumphs.
Already more than a hundred were said to the this year's opinion poll in a more exact way, 105 senseless rules and orders announced.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are so for example also regulations, that maintenance vehicles have to pay toll for motorways and expressways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must do every two years.
The list of the this year's "seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition in each case at the beginning of November on the Prager Wenzelsplatz is part of a happening which also personalities of the political and public life participate in regularly.
This year was for example Eva Svobodová, the directress of the association of small or centrally located enterprises and traders of the Tsch. Republic as well as Petr Kuel, the president of the chamber of commerce of the Tsch. Republic near the climax of the competition with of the lot.
"Where the state flings the entrepreneurs sticks between the legs, there can not be any real economical upswing, therefore it is my objective to pick up every year of at least thirty Paragrafen that today complicate their enterprises for the entrepreneurs still unnecessarily," Martin Kocourek, the minister of industry and trade with, split up.
The efforts to obtain senseless orders from the world show effect.
In the year 2007 the duty imposed on entrepreneurs disturbed the people the most, to have to announce to the trade office at the place of their constant firm three days in advance the intention to want to go with a booth to an exhibition or kermess.
This duty was canceled by virtue of a novelette of the trade law.
The duty, that 2007 the second-largest number the voices' kept - the duty, to have to announce official trips of employees to the labor office in the extent up to 30 days - so-called "Green Party member Karte" was eliminated through the law about them.
And - all good things' are three:
The regulation that imposed it on physiotherapists was chosen for the absurdity of the year 2009 in the consulting room a mirror, a refrigerator and two scales have stood.
This regulation was quite moderated by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare this year - the refrigerator duty was omitted.
A new category acknowledges socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A novelty in the this year's one already fifth age-group of the competition of the economic newspaper (HN) "Responsible company of the year 2010" is the category.
It is a basic idea of this competition to support reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We would like to support such companies that are conscious of the consequences of your entrepreneurial activity onto the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile radio enterprise Vodafon, says that crier and guarantor of this competition, just the same as soon as the competition's "rebel of the year" is.
Companies for which the success is not the only long-term objective enrolled themselves for the this year's first age-group of this specific lower category of the main competition Vodafon Firma the year.
The history of every of them is extremely inspirativ and would offer enough material for an independent article.
Although they distinguish with respect to the object of their activity diametrally, nevertheless their efforts have a common denominator - support and consideration.
Here it is a question for example of handicapped people, there around personal problems or the health of the own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from whole Czechia emerged so for example also the Prager software enterprise Et Netera, that supports the origin of sport teams not formal among their employees that then participates in numerous tournaments in most different events.
Another example of a responsible company from the region Pardubice is the society Isolit bravo, the already seventeen years long main sponsor of a foundation ground for handicapped children is.
Also a paper factory from Podbrady takes care exemplarily of their sanitarily handicapped employees that form 70 percent of their staff for which they was appreciated with the title "Responsible company of the central Bohemia region"; in the competition Vodafone Firma of the year she proved the third rank within the framework of this region.
In the region Olomouc the accountancy company MiRyz Soft triumphed, who introduced among other things a working time liquid and in addition reduced to 35 hours on the average weekly and this without relative wage decrease.
The jury honored also the circumstance during the title awarding, that the company mainly shops at Czech manufacturers, supports Bürgerinitiativen in their surroundings and works according to environment-friendly principles.
"We make an effort for recyceln so much as possibly in order to hold the consequences of our entrepreneurial activity and administration for the environment in a as small way as possible" declares their manageress Miluse Ryznarová.
The responsible IT enterprise Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region was in turn due to the health of his employees and therefore it has them to all Notebooks ergonomic armchairs and keyboards bought, in addition it supports with their employees homework and in the case of company actions she uses Cartering services that are offered by a domestic protected workshop.
"In addition we support" the foundation "People in need," that gives the local Roma-Kommunität concrete help," Ondej Suchý, the representative of the company, says.
Last but not least also the activity is erwähnenswert to the cleaning company "Praní a istní" from the Karlsbader region, that their employee in the form of extra-bonuses to their annuity contract contributes.
"We give to our employees contributions" Josef Strapá of the building firm Czasch says "with regard to the catering, for the working route, for the rise of their qualification and for the vacation," from Bruntál, the winner in the Mährisch-Silesian Region.
For the category Responsible company of the year were automatic all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Firma the year announced, that the questions of the questionnaire enclosed with the registration answered and sent it at the latest up to the 15.August the organizer.
Wrongly or incompletely filled answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies let the questions in an unanswered way, they were impossible from the competition "Responsible company of the year," in the main competition Vodafone Firma of the year they were not disqualified therefore, however."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible since he is only a lower category of the main competition company the year," declares Karel Goldman of the organizing agency bison & Rose.
Pilsner ground grounds - arrests of the police at a public announcement
In the building of the ground ground in Pilsen the anticorruption police carried out in the last days arrests.
In this case the local media-entrepreneur and estate agent Lubos G. was led away to handcuffs by the detectives.
This had attempted supposedly to manipulate a just occurring public competition for the handling of restitution claims so that the plots offered in the competition fell to a concrete prospective customer.
Half a million is supposed to have paid this Lubos G. for that.
"To this time I can only confirm that the police follow a person because of the offense of fraudulent machinations at a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner one prosecution of the newspaper "Právo," it can not give further details with regard to the current investigations.
24 hours later the 46-year old entrepreneur was released by the police again.
In which way it could manipulate the public competition, one can only speculate on that faced with the sparse official information.
The speaker of the Lubomír erná ground ground led onto the related question from Právo, the police carried out arrests in the Pilsner branch of the ground ground in fact and this during a public competition.
"It was a question around a client and by no means of one of our employees," it concretized.
The public competition had followed woman erná the correct denomination "Request to the offer delivery of claims to the transfer of plots according to the ground law" and would occur in cases in which several proposers express interest at the offered plot.
"These persons offer within the framework of the request a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled through the transfer, as the property value called out."
"According to the offered claims the precedence of the potential acquirers is defined, afterwards the ground fund transmits the plot to the person with the highest offer," the speaker of the ground declares.
Information were available to Lubos G. obviously, who had enrolled himself there onto the request and since he himself was an entitled person since it a series of restitution claims had been bought he offered one plot interests, that he withdraws from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
That would be also a sufficient declaration for why he had such a great amount of money during his arrest with himself.
Lubos G. had already in the past far too good contacts to the Pilsner ground fund.
So he played also in the Causa of the former head of the ground ground Václav Sankota a role which was pursued legally because he handed over in replacement restitutions plots to which already location decisions to projects had been made.
Then Lubos G. of the ground fund acquired for example also plots that were certain to the construction of public streets, in a more exact way said, at the place where the construction of the Zufahrtsmagistrale to the trade area Borské poles was planned.
Later he exchanged these very favorably with the municipal council for a house directly in the historical center of the city which climbed over the value of the plots far.
The city hall had to endanger then heavy Herzens Kleinbeigeben in order the project not through the blocking of the plots.
The living-costs of the budgets increase around some hundreds monthly
The budgets do not have to reckon from January only higher costs for all energy kinds, but also with higher water and waste water fees and for Fernwärme and mancherorts also the rents increase.
Families will have to pull January several hundreds of crowns monthly more so off from the purse than up to now.
Stream becomes to about 4,6 percent more expensive, gas around 2 percent and more, in some cities one will have to pay more up to a tenth for water deliveries and mancherorts also the long-distance heating deliveries increase in price.
Only the stream price increase costs some a hundred crowns more to the apartment budgets annually.
The heavy current prices were reduced in this case by all main suppliers, the clear promotion of the electric power production is guilty therefore from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaics installations.
If gas becomes only moderately more expensive the most then exactly the people indeed this, however, must heat, and they have the highest consumption.
Also here some a hundred crowns more per annum are to be reckoned therefore.
During stream and gas in whole Czechia teuerer become, the prices are different for long-distance heating from city to city.
Particularly bigger places' level increases in prices.
So more must pay for example the budgets for Fernwärme monthly in Pardubice and Hradec Králové from January up to 50 crowns, more than 1000 crowns more per annum pay families in Liberec.
To threaten the inhabitants of Prague in turn 9 percent of higher water and waste water fees and this for the case, that the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent is not changed, it is only 6,8 percent.
The price heard in Prague in comparison with whole Czechia, however, also furthermore to the lowest.
In the north Bohemia, where the prices belong already now to the highest, water and waste water fees are supposed to increase around 7,4 percent.
Enormous rent price increases are to be expected for example in 140.000 flat lets for rent near which from January the so-called rent regulation is omitted.
So for example the CPI apartment enterprise intends to increase Byty that has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem the rents from January like about a hundred percent.
Who with this rent increase does not agree agreed, the enterprise wants to prosecute that one judicially.
The adjusted rents which one pays today still in approximately 300.000 apartments might go up next year around more than 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it simply seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, by way of exception also once a good whiskey that one stole from the father from the house bar.
Those ones are the drinks, according to whose pleasure drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen most frequently are need-treated must.
Children that must sleep off their tomcat repeated in the hospital are not an exception.
This follows from the experiences of doctors which are confronted with similar cases by clinics in the photo of the child departments.
"Beer or wine are complete from the fashion because it long lasts simply too until one is drunk."
"The present trend is unequivocally hard alcohol," said Právo Ludk Pelikán, the medical superintendent of the child department, in the middle-Bohemian clinic Hoovice.
"Whiskey, when succeeds in stealing a bottle from the father from the house bar, and otherwise, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that one can mix it with Juice then it does not smell so strongly," the medical superintendent declares.
The speaker of the department hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives to him right.
Most "frequently it is a question of Fernet or Of that."
"That is the present alcohol trend, in particular at elementary schools."
"Occasionally it was a question also of Slibowitz that one takes along from home" Ms Jurinová mentioned.
According to medical superintendent Pelikán alcoholics thirteen or fourteen year old are not an exception appearance in the hospital photo for a long time.
Before the clinic in Hoovice which he works on since this year it was for ten years active in the pediatrics department of the hospital Motol, where the rescue cars tipsy pupils from near and far from delivered.
"A girl had to be hospitalisiert four times."
"She began your career with 12 years, als sie the first time with 3,5 per mille of alcohol in the blood and still for this purpose in combination with "Extase" was delivered," the doctor described an especially difficult case.
"It was in the exhibition grounds in Holesovice on some dance party."
"That was interesting, that it occurred their mother not at all strange, that their daughter" did not "come" home 48 hours, the medical superintendent is surprised.
Just the missing interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance while activating with the own grafts is regarded as one of the main causes for the wachsenden alcoholism of children.
It is not a question of a real dependence in the true sense of the word according to experts with children.
"Under alcoholism a long-standing chronic dependence on the alcohol along with all in this way is hanging together phenomenon understand and that is not the case with these children."
At those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly mostly a more negatively familiar-social background is characteristic," declares medical superintendent Pelikán.
The speaker of the hospital Motol, according to Ms Jurinová, were sent until middle November approximately forty drunk children in the local department of child and youth medicine.
Yet only the cases with difficult alcohol poisoning that required a stay in hospital come in into the statistics.
Drunk children are not registered who are brought home by the police after out-patient treatment of the parents or where appropriate.
Except for the cases, in which children only it gives to drink up such a bottle of liquor once in the school bench in opinion of gentlemen Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes onto which in an one hundred percent way Verlass is: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The last-named one for two reasons - either from grief because of the bad report or from joy onto the vacations."
"In the Walpurgisnacht I already saw seven drunk children at the same time in the photo," stresses doctor Pelikán.
A drunk child that spends the night under medical supervision is switched on paradoxically better, as a child that has to fight only with an unpleasant tomcat on the next day.
One can market the headaches at the morning after that that stem from the dehydration and from the glucose lack in the hospital indeed with a liquid-donating drip with glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"You are switched on unequivocal better, because after the "marvellous" experience at the evening, they wake up with good mood without something doing sorely somewhere."
"You are only a little confused about that where they are" doctor Pelikán adds with which it spoils the patients the good mood sometimes at least through that when it counts them the costs, that will cost it to the treatment.
Because the transportation with the rescue car and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly to a few zig a Thousand Crowns.
"Occasionally I have that than education means uses if I have vorgerechnet to the children directly during the doctor's round, what cost their drunkenness and that it can absolutely happen, that they once the whole vacations over" doctor Pelikán added "to have to work in order to earn the money for an only such party."
In his opinion the health insurances do not reach, however, for recourse procedures, to demand around the costs of the parents necessary for the cure of the drunken children.
Two training airplanes L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 of in total five that the Czech Ministry of Defense exchanged for the airliner Casa C-295M flew on Tuesday into the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish airplane manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
It is the first time that there are machines of this type in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad they were to be seen up to now only with maneuvers or flight shows.
It is a question at that of the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1 which was practiced by the Czech army.
The remaining three airplanes are single-seated L-159.
These stand currently still conserved in the Äro Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - it took over last week.
When they the airplanes physical from Vodochody expediert, Jan Pejsek is, not confessed according to the speaker of the Ministry of Defense yet.
The single-seated fighter aircraft L-159 were removed in turn from on a long-term basis intercalary airplanes and this without further insertions and investments on the part of the department of the ministry.
"The doppelsitzigen L-159T1 were exchanged in present state and appearance," said Pejsek of the newspaper Právo.
He added, the army will not have to manage without zweisitzige fighter aircraft, signed there the Ministry of Defense in May 2009 with Äro Vodochody a 200-million-contract above the reconstruction from four superfluous L-159 for the zweisitzigen version.
A new airplane took over the army in July, the second wants to take it over until end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS committed itself to putting through the fighter aircraft into the outfit of one of the NATO-countries.
"In the contract it is klipp and clearly mentioned that the enterprise EADS is customer of the airplanes L-159 and that these are supposed to be used for the training of pilots of the NATO-countries.
"It is therefore a thing of the customer in which way he realizes the thing," mentioned Pejsek.
The economic newspaper (HN) reported vordem, that the Spanish government does not have any interest in the L-159.
The barter of five L-159 against an airliner Casa and the purchase of further airplanes for 3,5 billion crowns had still been approved of in the last year by the government from Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense had not written out then any announcement procedure for the purchase, but that spoke TO EADS directly.
The former defense office argued, this exchange will support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Äro from 72 machines from which she uses only 24, she wanted to dispose of the rest.
The purchase of the airplanes Casa might have after all also still a judicial consequence.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defense indeed at the European Court of Justice. The reason? The airplanes due to a whole-European announcement would have had to select it and by no means through addressing of an only manufacturer.
The army took over already three airplanes Casa, the last one is supposed to land within fourteen days on the Airport Kbely.
A longer forefinger than ring fingers means a lower risk, to fall with cancer ill
Men, whose forefinger is long, as the ring finger, are obvious one exposed to smaller risk, to fall with prostate gland cancer ill.
That is the surprising result of a study which was published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
That is supposed to be associated indeed with the mirror of the masculine hormone testosterone.
"Our results show, that the relative length of the fingers can serve for the risk of prostate gland cancer as a simple test and this in particular with men to sixty," the Mitautorin of the study, Ros Eeles, declared professor at the oncology institute at the university in Warwick.
The finger could help so to determine which men should absolutely subject themselves to a prostate gland cancer test particularly, if genetic risks or other factors of risk are available, as for example familiar sanitary loads, Ms Eeles added.
In the period of 1994-2009 she hunted more than 1500 patients with prostate gland cancer with their colleagues in Britain, simultaneously however also 3000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants of the study the forefinger was shorter to the right hand than the ring finger was.
The same probability of prostate gland cancer was valid for these men, as for 19 percent of those men, whose struggling and showing-finger were now long.
With men that Zeigefinger was longer than the ring finger this risk sank, however, around 33 percent, with men to sixty quite about 87 percent.
The relation of the length of the two mentioned fingers that form themselves already in the pränatalen age reflects obviously the different mirrors of sex hormones to which the child was misfired in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer forefinger.
Former investigations showed that the testosterone just speeds up the growth of prostate gland cancer.
Václav Paes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairpersons of the academy of the sciences, TK said, this study is fleetingly known to him, nevertheless he does not hold the relation for "completely proven" between the finger length and the cancer risk up to now.
Czechia in the snow - D1 and D5 are spaced
Just the same as that one the biggest part of Europe lies also Czechia at the Thursday morning under a snow coverage.
On the streets and walkways snow mostly gotten stuck lies, the Winterdienstler were the whole night in many places on axis.
The motorway D5 between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is spaced because of some accidents of trucks and Pkws and also the D1 near Brno in direction Prague "stands."
Novinky.CZ of the dispatchers of the Central self Moto-club (ÚAMK) said this.
At kilometer 91 a TRUCK verunglückte, at kilometer 93 two trucks collided, during this accident there are injured persons.
Also a few Pkws lie in the street ditch.
There are problems also at kilometer 185 of the motorway D1 in direction Prague.
Also here two trucks collided.
The drivers should leave now behind Brno at kilometer 190 or go via Brno and drive up at kilometer 182 near the place Kývalka.
There jams miles long indeed form themselves.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and that now near the access to Prague.
In Prague itself a snow coverage several centimeters thick lies and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees centigrade.
Columns of cars form themselves for example in the Stadteil Prosek, also the street Štrboholská was completely blocked.
The most secure means of transportation is there in any case the metro.
The streetcars drive with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and peace place.
At eight o'clock in the morning the Prager crisis stick comes together.
Also at the railroad and on the airfield there are problems.
The Czech State Railways had to cancel seven express train connections because of snow banks.
There are problems to Beroun for example on the Prague stretch - Kralupy or also Prague.
The travellers should absolutely find themselves out of the current situation.
The Airport Ruzyn is since Wednesday 11 o'clock at night until 5 o'clock in the morning locked.
Most streets in south old mares are passable only with increased caution.
Around Vyskov three minor roads are completely unpassable, in the surroundings of Brno occasional snow banks form themselves and in the surroundings of Blansko one is forced to use snow milling machines on some more highly sited streets.
Výskov is one of the the most affected areas.
There three streets are still completely spaced: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kürov and also Šaratice - Milesovice.
Also here one will have to start for the snow clearing snow milling.
When they become again passable can not be estimated until now.
In the region Hodonín caution is announced on the field of the white cirque godfathers.
On the streets that may be scattered for nature conservation reasons only with inert litter means an up to five centimeters thick snow coverage lies, TK mentioned.
In Czechia fell from two to ten centimeters of fresh-fallen snow, the most in north Bohemia - occasional to 18 centimeters.
In the Mährisch-Silesian Region up to 15 centimeters of fresh-fallen snow fell.
In Czechia it stops, however, slowly snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent arm."
The American troops fitted in a new "intelligent" arm which up to now is confessed only under their code designation XM-25 into Afghanistan for the first time.
The generals hope for this new automatic arm influencing the nonlocal conflict with the Taliban and changing the balance of power for their advantages.
The new arm is something, as a superexact cannon.
Your projectiles are steered indeed into the objective by lasers with an accuracy only of of a few meters.
The specific projectiles of caliber 25 mm that were developed for this rifle and contain highly explosive explosive function practically as small shells.
The projectiles can be programmed so to their being able to explode not only during the strike onto the objective, but at an arbitrary point of their ballistic flight path.
That is, one can use it against an enemy, that behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench hides.
From above it is not usually indeed protected, the murderous steel splinter rain of above can set it therefore easily except for combat.
According to Richard Audett, that the XM-25 participated in the development, the new combat rifle is the first infantry arm, that "intelligent" technologies too Nutze does.
"The soldier goes ahead basically so: he aims for the objective and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact visor point to which it corrects the angle of elevation then he only still needs to fire.
"Let's say one measured 543 m."
"If one fires, the arm is charged and the projectile fires 543 meters onto the distance plus minus one, two or three meters from.
400 jobs are shifted
The Fujitsu company group shifts his subsidiary to Frankfurt in bath Homburg.
In July next year's 400 employees lay out their job of the previous office building at the Marienbader place in bath Homburg into the Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu company group shifts his subsidiary to Frankfurt in bath Homburg.
As the branch giant specialized onto computers and their maintenance on Wednesday informed, 400 women lay out in July next year and men their job from the previous office building at the Marienbader place in bath Homburg into the Astro Park, that is a big office building at the Lyoner street in the Frankfurter quarter low wheel.
A speaker of Fujitsu explained for the time being further 100 jobs of the company group should be placed there still that are distributed up to now onto the region.
The rent offer was extremely attractive, furthermore the open plan offices would comply in the Astro Park with the working method of the employees better.
Also in bath Homburg Fujitsu had been only to tenant.
The responsible manager Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt low wheel we found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection at the airport is just for a global enterprise as Fujitsu of great importance.
The recent move of an important enterprise within the region caused yesterday joy with the winners and disappointment with the losers.
The Frankfurter economic departmental head of Markus Frank (CDU) said a "Global Player" was won in this way again.
That is a "splendid location confession."
Fujitsu fits to the city, the laying out is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The bath Homburg chief burgomaster Michael Korwisi (The greens) the decision of Fujitsu felt sorry.
The city was informed early of the intention from the management.
"We offered our help to the enterprise as a matter of course," said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts could not have changed, however, anything at the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the Immobilie at the Marienbader place.
Ultimately would have given economical reasons the rash.
Now it is a question of preventing a long empty state at so prominent place.
"I hope, which shows owner and landlord of the building cooperative."
The house from Fujitsu up to now used at the city hall place and the adjacent "Small perpendicular" belonged with the remaining buildings at the Marienbader place ten years ago for the most controversial projects of the cure city.
As a common project of the city and a private project developer a new city entree which guaranteed for criticism both because of the massive development of the faces before in part used as parking place as also the height of the buildings arose between railway station and city hall.
In 2001 got the investment consultings and rating enterprise Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales and marketing systems, start of Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu then still united with Siemens the houses.
The buildings used from Fujitsu was acquired 2006 of the Frankfurter German immovable chance group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA a year later in Madrid.
The resident in Tokyo Fujitsu-Konuzern describes as third-largest IT-Provider of the world.
He provides enterprises for for example computer and server and achieves also the necessary service.
The subsidiary in the Rhine main field is one of the largest in Germany, by far more employees counts Fujitsu, however, in Munich.
From bath Homburg the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves in in Frankfurt low wheel, the further subsidiaries at this location are supposed to be Fujitsu Services and an enterprise by the name of TDS.
For that in the office building Astro Park 7000 square meters were rented.
In the twenty years old complex - the name alludes to his star-shaped outline - the central association electrical engineering and electronics industry has his seat among other things.
Amazon blocks servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks gets increasingly into distress.
The internet service provider Amazon banished the disclosure platform from his servers.
Possibly political pressure is behind that after the publication of hunderttausender secret diplomat-dispatches.
Wikileaks-founder Assange stays supposedly in England.
The disclosure platform Wikileaks gets in the United States under bombardment increasingly more strongly.
The internet-activists lost the access to their previous American server and search now an internet-home in Europe.
Meanwhile the prominent American senator Joe Lieberman appealed to other countries and enterprises for the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks-founder Julian Assange who stands on the search lists of Interpol is supposed to stay according to a newspaper report in Great Britain.
"Wikileaks replaced from Amazon-server."
"Free speech in the country of the free ones," the disclosure activists informed by brief news item service Twitter on Wednesday (Local time).
Shortly before the internet-enterprise Amazon had banished the Wikileaks-documents from his servers.
The internet-activists had accessed to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) during the publication of the secret diplomatic dispatches in order to be able to overcome the high access numbers onto the documents.
By Twitter Wikileaks kept on declaring as the step: "Excellently - our dollars are spent now in order to be preoccupied people with in Europe."
If Amazon has such problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of his servers through Wikileaks, after employee of senator Joe Lieberman Nachforschungen would have started, the television broadcast station told CNN under appointment on the office Liebermans.
The chairperson of the senate committee for home protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, told the British "guerrilla warfare."
"I would have wanted that Amazon takes this measure formerly faced with the previous publications of classified information through Wikileaks," said the senator.
Meanwhile Lieberman called for that, the platform also in other countries to refuse the use to servers.
"Wikileaks' our national security risks illegal, monstrous and inconsiderate procedure and "To Live endangeredly around the globe," was called it in a communication of the independent senator.
"No responsible enterprise - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks at his efforts to spread stolen material.
Wikileaks-founder Assange who is searched in Sweden by the authorities because of rape suspicion stands on the search list of Interpol.
According to a report of the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year old Australian stays in Great Britain, the exact place is known to Scotland Yard.
The internet-activist always referred to the investigations as an intrigue of his opponents in Sweden.
Wikileaks-speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls after an assassination of Julian Assange."
Therefore Assange fears for his security, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder keeps on being hidden therefore hold.
Hrafnsson reacted obviously to statements from North America.
In America the former republican governor had demanded from Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, that the person responsible is supposed to be accused of betrayal for the Wikileaks-disclosures and executed.
In Canada a consultant of head of the government Stephen Harper said - obviously ironic - on televison, Assange "should be killed" and Obama could use a drone.
Meanwhile between the White House and Assange an exchange broke out.
The speaker of the American president Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation from exterior minister Hillary Clinton if it is responsible for espionage-requests recently become known at diplomats.
"I am not sure, why we see to the opinion of a type with a web page," so Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than his a web page."
The American government checks now the protection of their databases comprehensively.
As a special representative the vice-director of the center was appointed for anti-terror-measures, Russell Travers, informed the White House.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structure reforms" that became necessary according to the disclosure of the message reports through Wikileaks.
The White House wants to make also the ways as the entire government exchanges and protects information be checked.
The American government announced furthermore to want to guarantee for the security of dissidents and most active, if they should get into danger through the Wikileaks-publication.
"We undertook everything, to get with them into contact," exterior office speaker Philip Crowley said.
"We stand ready to protect her if that should become necessary."
The egg-university
At the "Gelato University" near Bologne ice confectioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three day long basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest inflow and visitor from the whole world.
From where does the whole ice come actually?
Of the Gelatiere and of the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German a little outmoded the ice confectioner, the cream makes according to all rules of the Italian egg maker art.
The Gelataio gets the ice cream with a putty knife from the cold shelves, it deletes into the waffle and she sells then.
In order to know that, one does not have to go after Anzola dell'Emilia in the Bologne province.
But who would like to know still more above ice that one does not pass by the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer fitted out the egg-university from ice machines in the year 2003 so that the ice cream is raked to the high Italian ideals everywhere from his machines.
The three day long basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest inflow and visitor from all world.
There are, however, also more days special courses about around the chocolate ice and practical trainings in the in-house ice-cream parlor.
Some dreams in the Midlife-Crisis about a new career, others venture simply once onto the smooth ice of their vague longing-addictions.
This time 40 participants are it from 19 countries of all continents - of Brazil above Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food-movement and wants to offer the industrial Ice-Cream a European quality product in the future in the country.
Anke from Berlin is management consultant and wants some Own eintüten after years in a nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptians dream about opening an ice-cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to correct the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
Mästro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream first of all.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also the silky pliability and the good consistency.
Luciano forgets the cream hood of the national and anyway südländischen projecting part during his training but neither: "Italienisches Gelato is simply the best thing - and then still every amount of romanticism in this case is."
The first step to the production seems very simple.
Milk, cream, milk powder, sugars and stabilizers into a big blender which arouses everything with an electronic program on 85 degrees and cools off immediately on four degrees then, tilts the basic ingredients to Luciano.
Then he opens a cock at the machine, and out a pasteurized white base cream, basis, comes for all milk ice sorts.
Immediately the university lecturer is bombarded with questions: Can one manufacture ice cream only with natural materials without stabilizer?
How one can let the own experiment pleasure free race?
Luciano warns before making oneself be led from the spirit of the time into the insane.
Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients," used possibly in spite of that stabilizers - mostly a natural product, about Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne.
Of course one can manufacture ice also without stabilizer, only it must be sold then within a day, otherwise it collapses in itself, and the customer bites open loud ice granules'.
Certain variations at the groundmass are allowed.
It becomes more thrilling with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice maestro Luciano differentiates between the ingredients which one buys in the fruit-department or with the sweets of the supermarket.
Furthermore there is powders and pastes gives.
"The suppliers" attempt to turn on to you dozens flavored additions all."
"However, you should experiment simply once."
Either at the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or now at the ice cream from the white groundmass, which becomes the yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder for the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now may the course participants onto the ice machines.
Luciano lets it to each four different kinds of Vanilla-, to manufacture chocolate, espresso and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the groundmass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additions.
Also the fruit ice-cream sorts are subjected to the same experiment.
More aroma materials, more fruit puree - that is not flavorful absolutely better.
Haselnuss-Eis does not taste absolutely nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice makes the team that uses more fruits less water and a little less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture lifts the taste of a Gelato correctly out, says Luciano.
Ice production is an arithmatical problem: If peach-puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar part must be reduced in the basic prescription.
For Zitroneneis an extraportion of sugar is necessary.
Luciano pulls out a device with which it determines the sugar content of the fruit sorts (Wine-growers measure in this way the Öchsle in the must of grapes).
For the luck tables relieve the Rechnerei.
Making ice does not require more so much physical use as formerly.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the base sizes helps.
There is also a device in which the ready egg-mixture simultaneously cremig is beaten and chilled on minus temperatures.
All automatization zum Trotz small breakdowns are not missing.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains themselves and his course colleagues of above up to below with fruit puree, than it the over-size stick mixer out of hand turns out.
"In every course," maestro Luciano means, "it is only a question of the time until something like that happens."
Controllers in the twilight
The European food authority Efsa is unterwandert by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
The expert group of Testbiotech which defines itself as an independent institute for the consequence estimate of the biotechnology formulates this reproach now.
"It rings as a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well," said Testbiotech-leader Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The conductor of the Efsa expert group for gene-technical changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and Ilsi under contract are a further Efsa-expert for years also with the lobbyist association.
That one is paid by company groups as Monsanto, Nestle or Bavarian.
Kuiper cooperated in the Efsa-specifications in a leading way for gene plants and stands in this way in a clear interest conflict, criticizes Then.
The Efsa-rules are word-identical sale-wisely with position papers to the Ilsi and would bear in this way the handwriting of the industry which actually is supposed to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech criticizes an interfood collision.
So a hochrangige Efsa manageress is youngest without editions or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta - and changed in this way the pages.
Also the Central German radio (MDR) had revealed recently staff connections between controlling EU authority and industry lobby, which made the Federal Office for Environment Protection poorly soundproofed just the same as EU parliamentarians.
Meanwhile the Efsa can not recognize any interest conflict.
One falls back to all serious data, also onto such of the industry as long as they are from high professional quality it is called in a comment.
One does not demand of the experts who work for Efsa that they do not have any contacts to the industry.
You would have to disclose these, however.
Kuiper grants his work for the International Life Sciences institutes (Ilsi) in the USA.
This calls himself neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for the risk estimate for biotechnology without lobby task.
In the thing independent experts as Then criticize, that gene-technical changed plants are approved currently without any feeding attempt at animals and is tested the reaction of gene plants to environmental impacts not.
"We want to know what for example gene-technically changed corn does on the field," says Then.
Present practice is it, only isolated proteins, not to test the whole gene plant, however, what does not supply any dependable results.
"If one does not search the risks, as one is supposed "to find" it then"?, Then asks accusing.
Also Angelika Hilbeck sees that like this.
The scientist researches since 1994 in the gene technique and is currently active at the Technical Zurich College.
The industry attempts on this field as in the USA now also in Europe more and more, critical scientists to influence or to discredit.
There are hardly yet therefore researchers that did not intertwine with company groups.
For enterprises critical studies would normally not be published.
"The industry controls the security research," says Hilbeck.
The track of the stones
Uli Gsell also has itself which one gets, about in total 400 kilos.
At the Monday evening it stood before the Stuttgart railway station, the tuba on the back.
It was demo.
It snowed.
The history is known: In September the diggers had moved up and had begun to break off a big piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was not the same one anymore: Zigtausende demonstrated against S21, the billion-heavy Tieferlegung of the railway station.
When it resulted in the construction stop, a majority of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, used in between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
It safeguarded a few of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You must not disappear."
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and erdenhaft."
When he sawed off one, that one smelt of cigarette smoke.
He does not know what it will do with the pieces yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The track of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest near Tübingen onto a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen established his stone-empire.
The 44-year long one sells old stones.
He bought all which accumulated with the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a disgrace, they would be milled to gravel or in the dump disappear," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen that once was a guard cottage.
Sworn and threatened one has it, he tells when in September in the newspapers it was that he bought the residues of the north wing of the breaking off entrepreneur.
But he talked to the S-21-Gegnern, for days.
And it declared to them, that it nevertheless nothing now at all for the demolition can.
And if it happens now, it is nevertheless the most reasonable thing then if the stones were reused.
About 200 S-21-Gegner took along then one the on average 80 kilos difficult ashlar, unit price 6,50 to 14 euros.
As souvenirs, unites, however, also in the hope to be able to return it at a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 big truck loads.
About half stores still in the forest, the rest is for a long time sold.
Gartenbesitzer, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
From everywhere they came and would have way-lugged, which trunk and supporter could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the impulse changed for a long time into "Mäuerle" or in limitations of cabbage beds.
"Actually this stone is not anything special," says Rongen.
"The political component would not be."
It climbs in his ground cars, a tour does through his 20 hectares big empire.
He studied and broke off law, late biology, then he was interested in computers and finally Steinhändler became.
And stone lover.
It stores 40000 tons of stones.
From whole Germany it carts his treasures together.
He says he is the tallest old stone trader of the republic.
It brakes.
In the snow lie artistically hewed sandstone.
"You belonged once to the Dresdner Marienbrücke," he tells.
Yellow Elbsandstein, warm, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It works the way high through the forest.
It points at a heap: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruher of Bahnhofs.
And wider.
"Beautiful travertine."
Once the ashlars belonged to the bleacher of the inhabitant of Stuttgart Neckarstadions.
Everywhere in the snow stones and histories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the cathedral Sankt Blasien, tuff of the Heilbronner hospital.
Which work, which efforts, which sweat.
If Rongen thinks of that, were hit as the stones formerly by hand and they were moved with simple tackle blocks and ox carts, he becomes very reverential.
"Nevertheless it would be a scandal, when one would become so some schreddern."
He did not become empire, stone-rich already not at all.
But the stone trader employs 14 people today, in addition stone-cutters, a sculptor, a smith, a glass blower and a garden farmer sat down above in the forest.
"We work in a hard way, but it is satisfactory," says the Resteverwerter.
Soon must it to Cologne.
Saving stones also there gives.
Talent fight for High-Potentials
There is it reger crush at the sideboard.
16 students push themselves around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweet.
The Technical Brunswick University and the car builder Volkswagen invited the machine building and design students to a Workshop.
In a kind of idea competition should they together with VW developers about the car of the future fachsimpeln - and to become acquainted with Volkswagen very incidentally.
In the contest around the cleverest heads many enterprises go in the meantime into the infighting and set, as VW, on co-operations with the universities.
Your mission: To recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls before they come to the labor market and are umworben by others.
And because the universities no installations over the services of their students hand over, attempted to spot one the exception talents in practice projects and to tie to himself.
On the second day of the Workshops at the TU Brunswick the car company group solicits the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ball-point pens, rubber bears and folders with VW-logo.
It tells the hopeful young talents about practical training programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the company group.
Nico Selle of the TU Brunswick is in charge of the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both pages: "The students get into contact to the industry and gain experiences."
Students can become acquainted with VW simultaneous, interesting candidates look at themselves nearer and consider who as employees into consideration would come."
Such co-operations are not, according to Selle, unusual.
It is new that the students are wooed so offensively.
"Otherwise the emphasis rather lay on the professional project," Selle says.
The fight for those ones fresh to graduates will become presumably even harder.
In many branches the enterprises can not select themselves their employees more from a big crowd of applicants.
But they must recommend themselves and especially around highly qualified workers croon.
There are particularly graduates from the engineer disciplines in an excellent negotiation position in this case.
According to the association of German Engineers VDI more than 40.000 engineer places remained in October vacant.
And the so-called engineer gap will become even bigger according to VDI-predictions.
For the economic examination and consultation enterprise KPMG Roman Dykta goes onto the talent hunt.
He organizes extensive Recruiting-events as about the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern escalope hunt, at which the participants must find their way by means of GPS-coordinates.
The enterprise wants to send eight promising students so in the next year through the USA crossways.
Very incidentally the participants can have a look at KPMG-branches and become acquainted with the enterprise.
Who with may, decides in two selection rounds previously.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies into the USA.
In the case of the blanking and twinge around the High Potentials at the universities the guns become increasingly bigger according to Dykta.
"We want to remove ourselves with the Race from the mass."
"Only one simpler Segeltörn was us too little."
For talent hunter Dykta the bill seems to open.
"We have until today contact with all participants of a similar action in the last year."
"Some stand shortly before their end and want to apply soon to us," he says.
Next to the direct beloved at the campus particularly small and medium-sized enterprises go also very classically onto the deerstalking in the case of professional fairs.
"We attempt to reach graduates on trade fairs."
"About on the Intersolar," Sitha Stübe, personnel head, tells with the heliotechnology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner enterprise employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the junior staff problems.
Currently 35 places are advertised on the enterprise web site.
"It is just very heavy to fill vacant positions."
"That costs a lot of time and money," she says.
A further way is the contact about the uni-professors.
Solarworld co-operates with different colleges, about the university, in Freiberg.
"The professors give tips, that one can do practical trainings with us or write his master's thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns are not announced with the solar specialist.
For that the enterprise attempts with other advantages to advertise itself: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and slight communication.
"A big concern can often not offer that," says personnel head Stübe.
Money does not play the title role anymore for a long time during the job search.
Flexible working times, child care or good rise possibilities are further decisive factors.
Solarworld occupied the 55th place with a study of the Great Place to Work Instituts among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The institute creates an annual Bestenliste of German employers.
For this purpose employee consults it as in a satisfied way they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the general conditions for the employees.
Personnel head Stübe expects also pluses from the placement at the job-searching ones.
"I think that applicants look about a potential employer especially according to external evaluations," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Akademie advises enterprises which want to establish themselves a good call with a long-term strategy as employers.
He recommends his customers more authenticity.
And that means, aloud Kriegler, particularly internal measures.
"The best way to make oneself attractive as an employer leads about the own employees," he says.
In the branch jargon that is called internal Employer Branding, that is employer brand education, within the own staff.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If one treats his people well and they identify with the enterprise, then they would advertise their employer very by oneself with friends and acquaintances.
"That is as a game with gang," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new drilling for oil
Before the coast of the Florida US Federal state in the golf of Mexico there will not be in the coming years any new drilling for oil.
The government issued a corresponding prohibition in Washington - and so that finally their former plans revoke.
Also before the Atlantic coast new drillings keep on being forbidden for the time being.
Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar informed of this on Wednesday.
Trigger for the strict prohibition which at least is supposed to be valid for the coming five years is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the misfortune, that eleven workers the life cost and to the greatest environmental disaster of the USA led, president Barack Obama had signaled on pressure of the opposition and the industry his willingness to approve new drillings in the eastern part of the golf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce in this way the dependence of the USA on oil deliveries from the exterior.
Who bears the responsibility for the disastrous oil pollution in the golf is not until today definitively clarified.
In the center of the criticism the British bp energy company group stands which is confronted with billion demands.
An investigation commission in the task Obamas is supposed to present their results in the course of December.
In October Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had canceled the drilling-stop imposed after the explosion.
In the connection different oil company groups had made immediately requests for new drilling-projects.
With sharper controls and more severe safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster.
Currently the responsible control authority which had fallen into disrepute after numerous corruption reproaches is reformed basically.
In parallel to that Obama announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas company groups.
The industry warns now in public against the supporting-amount turning out in the golf through a more severe regulation in a clearly smaller way than up to now.
"The plans of the government are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," the result of a current branch inquiry says through the consultant company BDO - still before the drilling-prohibition of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance laments furthermore the insecurity in the branch: "Nobody knows what will be changed with the regulation exactly."
Investments in new promotion projects would be postponed for the time being - at the expense of the growth.
Ogoniland burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells as at the service station: Billions of liters of crude oil run out destroyed the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
The people live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means it well.
"Does not trouble you off," the eco-activist calms the journalists: "You will get today still enough oil sludge before the lens."
The 37-year old Nigerian pursued the attempt to photocopy one up to the breast in the water of wading boy with the striaes surrounding it: In the regenbogenfarbenen water shine the scene seems almost pretty.
That under the surface brown crude oil swaths float is not to be seen.
Formerly it collected here bucket-wise prawns, tells Esther Badom at the shore of the Bodo-Jetty-river.
Meanwhile the sluggish fluent waters are completely dead.
Five years ago vast quantities poured from a burst pipeline crude oil into the gigantic wetlands.
Fisherman from the small town seemed likely now six hours must row Bodo in order to reach fish-containing waters: The Ogoniland sited in the heart of the Niger delta is regarded as one of the most badly verpesteten regions of the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps durchzogenen of courses the whole extent of the devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of the motorboat churns up bright water brown gravy who his hand dives into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen jut out as black licorice poles from the ground, sadly palms to be found occasionally leave their whisks.
Bird flocks as they are usual in wetlands otherwise one searches in vain: As soon as the outboard motor keeps quiet, spooky rest expands in the former paradise smelling as a service station.
"What happens here is an ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly: "We live in constant danger for the health."
The war comparison is made.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield umkämpftes since decades: Here the first Explorateure penetrated from Europe more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance organized itself in the 80er-Jahren with the later exekutierten writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the shell company group had to stop in 1993 his production because it became too dangerous for his oil workers.
Still today the return is refused to the enterprise according to Ogoniland: During from the entire delta region of the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling-sources and 7000 kilometers of pipelines daily more than two million barrel of the black gold are pumped, the oil fields are fallow in the Ogoniland, the situation is too unstable to the company group.
All paar a Hundred Meters jut out stählerne frames as bizarre sculptures of the water: "Christbäumchen" is mentioned the heads of the boreholes much too gently.
You are up to 50 years old, most to in the mark corrodes.
Again and again such a chuck breche auseinander, thinks Akpobari, then a constant stream crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion liters flowed into the ecological system of the delta after expert estimates in 50 years: Year for year the amount of oil, as it penetrated the sea with the average of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago before Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of the mankind.
Who is to be made responsible for the continuous ECO-DISTRICT, people argue about that.
While the shell company group is making responsible sabotage and the organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting chucks and leaky pipelines as main causers.
Shell lays down considerably lower security standards in Nigeria than else in the world usual, the US scientist Richard Steiner reproached to the company group in 2008: Only the rate of defects at the lines is "higher around a multiple than elsewhere."
At a place, that from the distance as a left, oil-blurred workshop in the open looks, emerge from the mangroves figures: You are splinter-naked and oil-blurred up to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, that in part with tubes united, to define in part arbitrarily scatteredly on the ground are, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel the crude oil is heated up above the fire for several hours, declares Michael, the head of the group.
First gasoline penetrates the absorbing-pot through the tubes, later kerosene and finally diesel trickles at the end of the management out.
So Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of diesel à 300 liters: "That is 34.000 Naira to us worth" - about 22 dollars.
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel scarcity in the biggest oil state Schwarzafrikas.
Nigeria is in charge only of a single refinery.
The diesel price ridiculously low with just 40 euro cents per liter the illegal cookers can undercut still: Because they get their raw material for nothing.
It comes from "Bunkerern" who tap the pipeline net right through Ogoniland: In this way daily at least 16 million liters of crude oil disappear to the country according to experts in the entire Niger delta.
Only one disappearing small part of the provisionally interbedded raw material is refined, however, illegally: Organized criminal networks which also politicians and hochrangige militaries are supposed to belong to into tankers and verscherbeln it on the international market fill the lion's share.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is owed to the machinations of the population or the lax production method rather, the activist Akpobari holds for academic in that.
"If the oil societies would not be perceived as intruders and if they would not have destroyed the base of life of the fishermen so thoroughly, neither there would not be sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
Meanwhile the Ogoni particularly to shell is the relation but in such a way it destroys that only a withdrawal of the company group would come into consideration: "Maybe other nationalities as the Chinese turn out than better."
There Michael becomes nervous.
"Highest time, that you disappear," the muscular oil man says.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
The illegal Ölveredler are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, indeed no arrest threatens them, presumably however a painful bribe.
Also the soldiers coming from the country north above all want to profit - as all Nigerians - by the raw material.
"This condemned stuff brought our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari.
Observers discover dangerous building defect in A380-engines
Apparently the A380 has a great security problem.
Observers discovered during the investigation of a need-landed machine a possible building defect which can lead to a "catastrophic engine loss."
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer now.
The passengers of the need-landed Qantas airbus had confessed at the beginning of November apparently much more luck than up to now: The Australian air law enforcement agency found a great security problem at their investigations at the engines of some A380 machines - and warns now against a possible building defect.
The potential defect would have difficult consequences: With an oil line connection it could produce tiredness cracks' and leakage's, it was called in a comment of the authority ATSB published on this Thursday.
This would have been able to lead to "one catastrophic engine loss."
Engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce are affected in 20 airplanes of the A380-row.
Under that the Qantas airbus is found, the one notlanden on the 4th November in Singapore must.
The Australian airline introduced now legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
She submitted a complaint reason near an Australian federal court which further juridical measures make for him possible against the enterprise into Sydney.
Qantas-leader Alan Joyce said his airline will demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire of the engine parts had solved themselves and damaged the bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce formed an oil fire as a cause for the damage.
After the incident 40 engines must be exchanged now worldwide up to.
The Australian observers announced to carry out further security tests at the super jumbo jets which are equipped with the affected engines.
The security recommendation is the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB-speaker Martin Dolan.
The security problem was held for sufficiently important in order to inform all concerned persons.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas-machine the airline had held their A380-fleet for weeks at the ground.
Singapore Airlines let about three of his eleven A380 in a temporary way at the ground.
The Lufthansa exchanged the engine at a A380 as a precaution.
The double storey airman is the biggest passenger plane of the world.
National snowfall activates traffic chaos
Germany completely in white: Overnight country snow fell almost as a whole.
There is chaos on many streets, trains and flights turn out.
In the case of car accidents at least three people died.
The winter frostet Germany: With icy temperatures snowed almost the whole republic in the night on the Thursday - what leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east partial 15 centimeters thick snow coverages lie.
On several motorways and many streets the traffic is strongly restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in the continuous use, did not become with the snow waving constantly again, however, ready.
Furthermore vehement gusts swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The federal office for navigation and Hydrographie (BSH) expected of 1,2 meters at the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein of the morning at tidal waves with water levels about the standard measure state.
In Saxony the snow banks led to the motorways and Federal roads to considerable problems.
According to the tempest headquarters Meteomedia alarm level was violet in the Saxon Switzerland therefore announced - the highest stage anyway.
In part fresh-fallen snow fell there 30 centimeters, fresh and strong winds provided Verwehungen.
There several trucks and cars got stuck in the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt the police announced great troubles on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led traffic to be faltered and jams.
In Thuringia the A4 and A9 were affected from the snowfalls.
According to German Railways Thuringia comes it into Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and in the north of Bavaria to considerable troubles.
Snow on the rails, overturned trees on the rails or destroyed overhead-contact systems and flanks are the main problems.
In Saxony the long-distance traffic had to be stopped from Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In the thüringischen hall field an ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied with blankets, Essen and drinks in the train by fire department people and rescue helpers.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
On big German airports the snow winds lead to numerous flight failure rates.
In Munich already some cancelings are announced to the flight information headquarters according to a speaker.
In Frankfurt on the Main already 40 flights were deleted according to a Fraport-speaker.
The winter service is in the continuous use.
Indeed only few stranded passengers are at the airport, in spite of that still just 400 campbeds would be prepared for them.
On many streets it already at the Wednesday evening to accidents came.
At the evening a truck-driver died during the collision with a train on a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The train driver became slightly injured.
Near Nuremberg it came due to snow-covered streets for a similar accident: Also here a truck was captured on a level crossing because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver died.
In the train four passengers were hurt - the stretch of Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore spaced until the morning hours.
Furthermore a 30-year old woman died after it had somersaulted with their car near Aschaffenburg on smooth street.
Nevertheless the meteorologists have a good information, however: Indeed the snow will be still loose and pulverig and swirl up therefore already at light gusts.
But the wind will diminish.
Only the Baltic Sea is afflicted by fast and blowing winds.
It remains, however, very cold - place-wise to to minus 15 degrees.
German bank searches a buyer for their twin towers
The German Bank wants to separate from their landmark: According to a newspaper report Käufer searches the money house at their Frankfurter head office for the two office towers.
The Immobilie could insert up to 500 million euros.
Just first the German ones bank did pretty their company group seat: The twin towers in the Frankfurter bank quarter were modernized; meanwhile might the bankers again onto their old job back.
However now the finance company group wants to get out the costs apparently again for the renovation - and searches for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes under appointment on a speaker.
The speaker did not name reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it is more reasonable immovables to have himself or to sell and to rent afterwards back," he said.
In this way Germany's biggest credit institution already gives his headquarters again off after short time.
The bank had taken over the double towers from the investors of an in-house ground first in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros and renovated them afterwards extensively.
The energetic reconstruction cost according to the information about 200 million euros.
A sale would bring presumably a lot of money to the bank.
Branch experts estimate the value of the towers meanwhile renamed in "Greentowers" at about 500 million euros according to the newspaper.
Whether a fund is disposed at of the buildings once again in the possession of the bank or onto an independent investor, is currently still open, the speaker said.
Thousands mourn for dead pals
More than 10.000 people thought in New Zealand of the spilled miners that were declared as dead after several explosions in a mine.
Yet the corpses could not be brought out because the security situation keeps on being precarious in the misfortune shaft.
Just two weeks ago it had resulted in a vehement explosion in the pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners in the age between 17 and 62 years were spilled under days.
A probe had been let into the misfortune shaft, had not discovered, however, any track from survivors.
Due to the high concentration of poisonous gases and further following explosions no rescue teams could descend from safety reasons.
According to the second vehement detonation the authorities and experts had assumed that there is not any survival chance for the pals anymore.
The corpses could not be brought out up to now.
Now members and friends with a commemoration reminded of the dead.
Ten thousand people had met near shining sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand south island.
For two minutes they were silent.
In honor of the spilled miners 29 tables were set up, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the pals were to be seen.
Also pictures and personal objects, under that garments and surfboards, found here their place.
Before the government buildings of the country the flags at half-mast waved.
New Zealand hoped for the miners coming onto the surface "from the depths of the earth" again, said the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemoration.
"But they have never come home."
It can not close with the death of his son as long as he did not see his corpse, said to Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was spilled in the pit.
Next to the Prime Minister and members of the victims several foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration.
During the first explosion on 19th November also miners of British and South African origin were spilled.
Rescue workers began with putting out a fire in the interior of the coal mine on the south island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are replaced, people begin with chilling the glowing temperatures in the interior of the mine, said chief constable Gary Knowles to journalists.
To the hell, warrior!
Does splatter fit to the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn plumbs old genre-borders again with his fighter-epic "Walhalla Rising."
Which public does the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn like to have thought of when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A caught Viking warrior only with an eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees from his tormentors and kills his opponents in rows with almost superhuman strengths - rings ideally for young masculine spectators in search of bloody Action, just because our hero uses gladly aggressive killing methods and tears his enemies the bowels already once from the live body if he has bad mood.
On the other hand it does not tell Einauge the whole film about any word how in fact it is called, and also the other figures can be forced at most into one or two sentences or a few very painful death screams once.
Else is kept quiet and feasted in the weirdly beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, that the Viking world of about a thousand years ago the scenery offers.
Ideal rather for grown-up film makers with interest in existentialism and very quiet tracks.
Beautiful if a film has several target groups damages only if they exclude themselves mutually.
Director Winding Refn is regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and gestylten drug dealer trilogy "Pusher," refuses, however, stoically to make to the main stream or a little to little brutality his works with something accessible to the Arthouse more humor.
Most art cinema friends might make be deterred from the around splashing brain mass and the bowels.
The Action-fans die at the latest from boredom then if Einauge opens for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and pins an eternity in lull and fog before apparently the team arrives in America and keeps on being silent there.
No miracle therefore, that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any cinema rental company in Germany and appeared only on DVD now.
That is a misery especially because of the splendid pictures, however also, because behind the prätentiösen one to blood-dripping facade a piece of cinema exciting occasionally hides, that earned some attention.
In this film it is not a question of dialogs or a stringente action, it is everything atmosphere, a film-become fever dream.
And from that there is not for the spectator any escaping.
Refn does not grant him hardly a moment of the relaxation and ties him up the throat very slowly with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, vor allem, however, with the incomprehensible hate that entgegenschlägt to him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small fair boy who stands loyally to one eye to the page preserves himself something as innocence, all others are driven from anger.
Most most of all the one-eyed hero whose that, however, become from the hell sometime for enemies and allies in a temporary way to the warrior motives are never explained possibly to the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means ruin, one maybe, however, also only for those ones anyhow Spoiled.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film which one can hate and admire to the annoying, annoying and astonishment.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The atomic energy authority IAEA has new references to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country defends itself, however, to take position for this purpose - nor it does not approve controls.
Against midnight of the 5th on the 6th September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attack a mysterious, die-shaped building in Syria.
It stands at the shore of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Your name emerges in documents of the International atomic energy authority (IAEA which comes off from the stream) when it is a question of the reactor which Syria supposedly built with help from North Korea in the ashlar, hidden in a valley.
According to a briefing of the US foreign secret service of CIA of end April in 2008 the reactor common also under the name of the near small town el-Kibar would have been well suitable to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes on the other hand the technique is hardly worth from the fifties.
The CIA demonstrated a video presentation with blurred satellite photographs.
By computer animation she inserted, where which components of the reactor are supposed to have been before the destruction that is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the atomic center Yongbyon.
Furthermore she presented photos, which show the building from the proximity or quite the interior.
The reactor stood shortly before the initiation, it was said, been not loaded with burning-sticks, however, yet.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, hardly more is known than then, the puzzles became with the time rather larger.
The former US president George W. Bush revealed youngest in his memoirs that that one was quite indeed sure of CIA that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but did not see hardly clues about there being in the country "an active nuclear weapon program" before the attack.
Some Geheimdienstler in Europe are even more cautious there more gladly and speak only of an "alleged re-actuator" even if they hold the CIA-presentation for "plausible."
You lack hard proofs, in the same way as the IAEA.
Asked how surely it is to have a reactor before themselves, a high UN-diplomat answered in the summer only succinctly, the IAEA has "material enough in order to ask questions."
The Syrians created the debris of the alleged "unused military building" urgently indeed aside and leveled the ground thoroughly.
Nevertheless an IAEA-team found in June 2008 tracks of uranium which had been made by people under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar.
Furthermore the IAEA about a member state received satellite photographs of commercial providers from the time directly after the attack, which might be more expressive than those ones of the CIA presented.
However, these photos are not to be gotten on the market, because the unknown customer has bought - maybe Israel - excluding them.
The IAEA can not verify therefore their genuineness independently.
Syria always declared to never have practiced a secret atomic program or to have built a reactor.
The uranium comes from the Israeli arms, declared Damascus.
However, the IAEA rejected that to analysis of the particles as improbable.
Since then Damascus refuses to discuss about that - just the same as about the satellite photographs.
Furthermore a second inspection into el-Kibar and the access to the ruins of the building bombed out refuses it to the controllers.
But also Israel is silent iron.
"We will never comment on that," the prime minister Ehud Olmert current in the attack's times confirmed recently the official position.
So the investigation of the case is dragged since June 2008 without any result there and "develops increasingly into a serious plausibility problem for the authority," as a high western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna grants - finally a difficult violation of the nuclear weapon blocking-contract stands in the room which the IAEA watches over.
The IAEA sees as keys to progress during the clarification apparently three more facilities that are supposed to stand "in functional connection" with the probable reactor - and still to exist differently than this.
Neither in this case the inspectors did not disclose up to now which installations it is a question of still which function they have or what makes her be appeared suspicious.
According to information of the South German Newspaper they are called Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah inside at the IAEA, in turn carried off by cities seemed likely.
The independent institutes for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and did on satellite photographs a complex of buildings at Masyaf ausfindig with which it is a question of one of the suspicious objects most probably.
It is possibly in or immediately next to a military base - refused exactly with this reason Syria of the IAEA the access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA is vorgeschickt by the USA in order to spy out military areas.
Because the nuclear detectives had become attentive through a tip of the US secret services onto the facilities.
The IAEA has tips, under that satellite photos, that between the three places and the ashlar at the Euphrates material hin- and was transported.
A high western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the installations could stand "in connection with the combustible production."
There are, however, "no references to sensitive activities," therefore uranic enrichment or reprocessing; Processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is practiced indeed with uranium which is not enriched.
However where the uranium should have come and gives where from that the plutonium should be separated later for the bomb, for these central questions it at best plausible suppositions.
It is also unclear whether ruins which could hide valuable tracks were stored at the three places.
As if the hundreds of truck loads would have disappeared from the earth, nobody wants to have information about that, where the debris stayed.
The only few kilometers of salt mine al-Tibni sited from el-Kibar on the other hand of the Euphrates that Syria examined for their suitability as warehouses for radioactive garbage in 1998 the IAEA is regarded as improbable.
The former IAEA-inspector Robert Kelley had brought it recently from satellite photographs in an analysis for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor in touch.
Photos from the orbit show, however, that Syria carried out at the three suspicious places earthworks and removed big containers after the IAEA Zugang had demanded.
That can be coincidence, if clearing the suspicion hardly contributed, however, to that.
Furthermore it means in diplomat circles to keep possible military secrets, the IAEA that should allow it to Syria put many months into developing a plan there for inspections - only the expenditure shows how in a large way the interest of the inspectors is.
While, Damascus ironed also this proposal off.
Western diplomats had appeased in Vienna still a year ago, the reactor is destroyed, therefore the thing does not have any high priority, it deprives for instance US ambassadors of Glyn Davies since a few months of so-called special inspections ins Spiel, one of the sharpest means that has the Viennese atomic authority of controls to put through.
IAEA leader Yukiya Amano already indeed has that would have to suggest these inspections of "an option, for which I am open in the future" spoken, nor, however, he does not hesitate.
A high risk lies in this way: On the one hand a majority needs it for that in the governor council of the IAEA, and many of the there represented 35 countries are keen on an escalation all but.
On the other hand, as a diplomat gives to consider: "What is if they do not find anything at the end at all"?
Love in times of the war
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work at their still nameless direction debut has begun, there is annoyance.
She herself wrote the screenplay, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
One does not know many more about that - however already that suffices for noise.
Stubbornly the rumor the woman, a Muslim, falls with their Serbian rapist in love during the Yugoslavia-war holds itself.
Bosnian woman associations protested immediately, woraufhin unites into knack days planned to Sarajevo at short notice to Hungary were laid out.
Meanwhile the film turned away in Hungary and in the postproduction, however protests still in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of feminine war victims wrote to Jolie over the UN refugee public social aid UNHCR and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper told now - Jolie is even an ambassadress of the UN refugee public social aid.
It is not diplomatic - she offered to the women before weeks already once a meeting in Hungary, which those ones, however, refused.
The meeting must occur in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
There were not love stories in rape camps, and betrays Jolies attitude opposite the victims their enough about the screenplay.
Your organization recommended according to the UN refugee public social aid to release Jolie as an ambassadress, tells the guerrilla warfare.
What exactly, however, did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that their screenplay agreed to read gave a knack permission Back and Forth after some for Sarajevo - it is not very clear why Jolie did not come then in spite of that.
Declared the young authoress herself she does not hunt any political intentions with their film incorporated with a lot of effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, want to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all shared pages.
With the contents it stays, however, vague.
So another second synopsis for the film in the net nevertheless to ring quite differently then circulates: The loving ones knew themselves in that already before outbreak of war and meet again when it, a Bosnian Muslim, is verschleppt into a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What nevertheless rings considerably differently than the variant "Rape victim verknallt in torturer."
That Jolies begins film in fact already before the war - so much is secure.
The pressure on them is, according to Jolie, "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now can provide their presumably only still that one hacker of Hollywood peace: When they the screenplay, as already so many before, to put into the net illegally.
Nothing as away here
At this evening it runs at last once again correctly about for the Irish.
No track of grief.
For that the home team dominates his guests too very much from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
The fans howl with joy at cracking loud music, they stamp with the feet.
The Bailey pub in the south-Irish Cork trembles because the players fling table tennis balls over a three meter distance in beer glasses - and hit.
"Bierpong" names himself the bizarre rackets, it gives 500 euros of victory premium to win plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill drinking-game and the reserved information scientist, that does really not match.
And nevertheless the 26-year long one attempts at distracting oneself from the piercing question, which will bring the future, to amuse.
On his plan game fun does not stand in Las Vegas, it will lead to the January application conversation in New Zealand.
"I have a ticklish feeling in this case," he says.
"It is so far from home and nor I do not have any work there."
After all: His friend waits in Auckland already for it - "they had ruck, twitch" the young man says "their wish job as an event manageress, maybe a good sign," and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home already two searched three siblings their luck abroad from Tanners.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin has now a place as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As at the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100.000 Irish will presumably leave the country in next time, predict experts of the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin.
To 2015 they reckon even 200.000 emigrants.
For the small country only with 4,5 million inhabitants a vehement loss.
If the predictions Bewahrheiten, it results in an emigration wave comparably with that which Ireland suffered from in the eighties.
After a decade of the upswing which brought great prosperity with themselves for the Irish dreary chimney spreads now once again.
The depression verunsichert in this case particularly the young, well trained Irish for whom it went up to now only uphill.
Job loss and social descent seemed in the boom years absurd.
Everyone was needed, there was money in plenty.
Meanwhile, however, three of ten women and men are less than thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are zuhauf reader's letters of young emigrants who complain: "Everything goes into Ireland the creek under that."
"There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - however who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation in this way."
"The last one does then the light from asks."
Jurassic-student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a dark future coming up because the government practices only eyewash and does not offer the young people any prospects anymore.
"You reduce the minimum wages, but they do not have any strategy as new jobs are supposed to be created," says the 20-year long one.
She observes, as their fellow students of an unpaid practical training to the next hangeln.
She says, your greatest worry, it is to have to emigrate in four years themselves.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
In this case men as Stephen McLarnon attempt to fill the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair which offers a Rundumservice on the topic to works abroad.
"Nevertheless for professional beginners the work is abroad a splendid chance to do the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his web page photos show surfers in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: To work abroad is not a galley service, but brings also freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan knows to establish something somewhere else, as it feels, since half a year.
Because not doing anything more for the 29-year old engineer in Ireland gave, it works now with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they pull up just a fashion house.
In January it goes on to Hanover or Berlin, for the next project.
Meanwhile only still O'Donovan sees his home rare, because it does extrashifts in order to be able to pay off the credit at home for his house.
"The situation is already a little mad," he says when it goes over the threshold of his house after long time for the first time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland in which I am as good as never again."
He laughs a little in embarrassment and goes through rooms cooled down.
The small house stands in one fine residential area's with well-kept front gardens, in the entrances big, expensive cars park.
Together with a sister O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380.000 euros - 100 percent credit-financed.
There were mad times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
He is afraid, that it could go wrong with the credit?
O'Donovan considers a while, pours hot tea after and says: "I do not have any children, that I must feed and am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can begin anew."
The civil engineer does not like the lamentation, that it hears at the time of often.
"Nobody has to hunger - nevertheless our situation is not as dramatic here on the island by far as in former times, "he says."
"A while abroad work, that is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we feel ourselves through that first as Irish."
He laughs and tells then about his father who went to England in the last great depression.
"After seven years it was again there and the life went on into Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
The future leave open and simply once look, how it runs with the life somewhere else.
He really already has a few years of work in London behind himself and why it should not run into New Zealand also well for it and his friend?
A thing which worries him appropriately in these days is still there, however: the celebration to his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could degenerate into a farewell-party.
"Only not too many emotions," he says and drinks a great sip of his beer.
"Farewell, nevertheless that rings frightening."
"Let's mention it more gladly a going party, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The demokatrische routine
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, so as the support of private enterprises.
Criminality is a greater problem than the unemployment is.
In many parts of the region the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States is.
For these results the Latinobarómetro inquiry came, that in 18 countries carried on and excluding in The Economist was published.
This inquiry is carried out since 1995 regularly and shows so the opinion change in this region.
Two facts fall in the this year's inquiry of September and October especially of in's eye.
Firstly the good atmosphere in Latin America
and secondly the wachsende interest at democracy and their most important institutions.
In numerous countries at the South American Pacific coast the democratic movement increased strongly (see table 1).
In Peru e.g. where the economy increases since 2002 annually around approx. 6% the number of the democracy proponents climbed from 40% per year in 2005 this year 61%.
Also in Mexico, where the economy recovers since the strong burglary in the last year again, such a trend is to be recognized.
Nevertheless only half of the interviewees in Mexico and Brazil, the most densely populated countries of the region, convinced democrats are, what lowers the regional average (see diagram 2).
Declared to approx. 44% of the interviewees, that they satisfied with the democratic practice of their country be. Those ones are so many as in the last year, however, 25% more than in the year 2001 (Diagram 3).
In about 34% trust the congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, show, however, a clear rise opposite 2003 (17% and/or 24%).
A decade ago Latin America's depressions untergruben the endeavours towards more democracy.
That this also during the world economy crisis lasted, is due possibly to the countries of Latin America experiencing only a short recession phase and recovering quickly again.
In addition the paupers were caught by a stronger social net.
(According to reports of the UN economic commission for Latin America of this week the poverty rate went up in 2009 into Latin America only insignificantly and fell this year around 32% again.)
However from country to country there are strong atmosphere differences (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the parting president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects in a spread progress thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more strongly perceptible and power crimes increased, this is the case less.
First for the second time since inquiry beginning many interviewees see a greater problem in Latin America in the criminality in their country than in the unemployment (see diagram 5).
Approx. 31% state that either she herself or a member of the family in the last year became victims of a crime. However, opposite 38% in the last year the values sank and reach thus the lowest state since 1995.
The increasing economic achievement reflects in the stronger support the Private- and the market economy against: approx. 71% of the interviewees indicated supraregionally that the private enterprise is indispensable for the development in the year 2007 it was 56% (see diagram 6).
Approx. 58% declared that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared with 47% in the last year.
Interestingly enough 62% of the interviewees retained this opinion in Venezuela (and 80% are for a private enterprise) although their left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private enterprises.
Brazil followed the biggest weight according to 19% of the interviewees (18% in the last year) in the region from the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% in the last year).
On the other hand to see the interviewees in Mexico and most countries of Central America in the USA the most influential country near which this role is taken over by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A choice setback
Nobody had expected that the choices would be perfect on the 28th November in Haiti.
But the facts surpassed the apprehensions of the election officers that were urgent for the shaken country for the help by far.
Full ballot boxes, multiple given voices, voter registration cards in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidations were only a part of the problems.
Polling stations opened with delay lasting for hours.
Many Haitians from whom many had become homeless through the earthquake in January roamed in search of an option.
Finally some completely gave up.
A dozen premiership candidates, under that unites supposed top riders, demanded due to an alleged fraud the cancellation of the election results.
In the whole country it resulted in in part violent protests.
Nevertheless Edmond Mulet, the conductor of the UN-mission in Haiti, referred to the choice "as quite good in many interests."
According to a cautious statement of observers of the organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities" do not "make the process necessarily invalidly" to like to be so seriously it also."
In other words, the show goes on.
The choice authority which is supposedly obliged to the unpopular parting president René Préval and to his candidate, Jew Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7th December.
The expected second ballot is arranged for January.
There is still hope into the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap-musician Michel Martelly and the former ridge-Lady Mirlande Manigat, pulled back their initial nullity complaint.
When Jew Célestin, that at the voters only small or no approval at all finds, declared as the winner of the second ballot by the Wahlberhörde, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera-epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents a small poll was feared.
Many Haitians were hindered the choice day through lacking organization at the voice delivery.
Shortly before choice beginning approx. 250.000 identity cards which are needed for the choice were not distributed yet.
It stands a lot on the game.
The giver countries consider a legitimate, acknowledged government as an important step during the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Secret in the middle of
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, found out a wave of sympathy which drove their popularity rate up onto more than 50% around 20 points. That is the highest value since their choice in the year 2007.
Whether this helps her to a re-election, however, in the next year depends on whether the Cristina Fernández mourning visibly is more willing to compromise than their late husband, their predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for that are not unequivocal.
Néstor Kirchner, who controlled the economic policy also after the choice of his wife, made frequently budgets which did not consider the tax yields, the economic growth and the inflation fully.
This allowed it the president pair, to distribute the extragains according to own discretion.
On the paper the Fernández-government lost in the last year the majority in the congress.
Nevertheless the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27th October led to further disagreements.
Some dissidents from the rows of the ruling Peronisten positioned themselves behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (in the case of which a parliamentarian beat to another into the face and others accused the government of the bribery) the congress did not succeed in adopting the budget for 2011.
"I" will not "discuss" about that," according to the president.
The budget 2010 is valid now also for the next year, through what the president has distributed still more occasion money according to own discretion.
The economy run hot: probably it will increase this year around up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is currently near 11,1%, however, numerous private estimates - and wage demand of the trade unions - drive the value onto almost 30%.
Kirchner that took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was joggled from depressions declared growth and poverty abatement as his main aim, and not the inflation lowering.
He refused the cooperation with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned the National Institute for statistics and Volkszählung INDEC, that then the official inflation statistics schönte.
Can Fernández take a more moderate way now?
She appealed to the private enterprise and the union leaders for conversations.
And according to official statements wage increases are supposed to be restricted in the next year on 18%.
The high world market prices for Argentina's farm products gave a strong impetus to the economy.
Nevertheless the inflation untergrub the growth push through a great devaluation in the year 2002.
Possibly Cristina Fernández would like to connect Argentina again finance-economically for this reason to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year the government found an agreement with security holders who had refused the former debt rescheduling of the country in the year 2001.
Now it seems to push Fernández onto an agreement with the financiers from the Paris club, that they approx. $6,7 Mrd. owes.
The Kirchners had always refused an inspection through the IMF, as somewhere else usual.
However, in the last month the minister for economic affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will perform "technical support" during the creation of a new national consumer price index. It looks as if this were the first step to the purge of the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active on completion of their term of office also without the support through their husband.
When yes, she needs the support of the middle class for that, that has most mainly enough of the Kirchnerismus.
If the Argentines return in March from their summer vacation, the wave of the Sympatie which was brought to her will have faded away.
If she liked to win a further choice, she must decide, whether she puts aside many for political decisions of their husband quietly and quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters come closer slowly to a narrower connection to the mainland.
What holds Taiwan of his tall brother beyond the straits?
On 27th November more than 7,5 million voters did themselves, those ones are open 70% of all elective, in order to elect mayors and town councils in the five municipal districts. This is evaluated as a wide evaluation of the president Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the construction of epoch-making business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is even a symbol figure for the relationships to the mainland. His politics changed the relation into the Chinese land of origin lastingly for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the examination, however only just.
Although his Kuomintang-party (KMT) sets three of the five mayors, she did not receive any majority of votes.
Instead of this the Democratic progress party (DPP) which approves a greater independence of Taiwan received almost 50% of the voices, the KMT received 45%.
At a premiership choice this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his choice two years ago the voice part of his party has fallen around approx. 8%.
For the first time the DPP moved in even together with the KMT in the town councils.
During the choice it resulted in the incidents usual in Taiwan as truck convoys with rioters, flag-waving mass moves and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the compulsory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT kept a speech to the eve of the choice onto a KMT candidate,
when a man fired to him from the amount into the face. Lien was wounded and killed a spectator overleaf.
Bizarrerweiser is not clearly whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or attach a quarrel with the candidate.
Independently of that the assault influenced the choice according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, and moved the DPP into a bad light, which brought the KMT more voices.
Possibly China was the tallest winner of the campaign.
Remarkable proofs became the relationships to the mainland not thematisiert.
Instead of this the candidates debated on plans to council houses and the job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and refuse China's military threat.
For this reason the KMT does not put their relationships to the government gladly into the foreground in Peking.
However, this time also the DPP avoided to stir up the anti-Chinese feelings too very much.
It reacted to the new consciousness, that Taiwan's economy without China can not survive.
Ma for his part would like to be able to confirm himself that the majority of the Taiwanese approves his China-politics.
The government in Peking will keep on pursuing his strategy, to lure Taiwan with economical stimuli back into the community.
China sent immediately an agent to Taipei in order to prepare a summit conference to investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly also a political integration wants it. But the most important thing first.
It maintains in this way more gladly to the premiership choices in 2012.
Meanwhile the DPP invented herself again.
Two years ago it was strongly weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was because of corruption in the prison.
During his premiership of 2000 to 2008 it kicked in vehement for the absolute independence.
Nevertheless under Tais regency developed a new generation of moderate politicians and the DPP fights for the voices of the working one and the youth.
Tsai found great approval, as Su Tseng-chang, as a premiership candidate of the DPP among Chen.
Your party does now everything in order to show that also it is in the situation to establish narrow relationships to Peking.
Tsai plans an idea forge as a contact point between the DPP and China. This presupposes, however, unprejudiced discussions.
Tsai declared in public that their party offers a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas of rash approximation to China.
Chen shines about this change very annoyedly.
From his cell it declared the candidates of the DPP would have done better at insisting on Taiwan's independence.
He even asked the pragmatist Su to renounce the premiership candidacy.
Also without Chens interference the DPP is for herself heavily to elect their possible candidate.
The KMT will have to subject herself to an own selfanalysis.
Mas values are bad, in spite of the rapid economic growth; the KMT-candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without it.
Seeming to be unemployment and the increasingly further scissors between arm and empire the main reasons for his unpopularity.
According to a KMT-speaker it will reshape his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP lets to presume that Taiwan approves a re-approximation only restrictedly.
Most Taiwanese see the economical cooperation with China as inevitable simultaneous.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there "is" not "already any back anymore.
Grammy-nominations: The jazz-singer Esperanza Spalding was distinguished surprisingly in the category Newcomer of the year
When you on demand a president auftritts, the people will notice it.
Esperanza Spalding asked president Obama himself for performing during the ceremony on the occasion of the Nobel prize awarding 2009. Now the 26-year old jazz-bassist and singer was nominated überrachsenderweise for the this year's Grammy in the category Newcomer of the year.
Faced with the fact that Spalding is already a celebrated star since their album "Esperanza" In 2008 in the jazz-scene the nomination appears a little bit unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy-rules according to which an artist may have handed over at most three white poplars for publication of the album which he became known with in the wide public.
Your ambitious album from the year 2010, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward. And one can compare Spalding quietly with their exhilarated voice and a good feeling for pop, radio and Latin Music, with Norah Jones 2003, who great success comes in the year 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category the nomination Spaldings nearest.
Further "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer trio was nominated the album in the category instrumental white poplars. This darling of the critics experienced a huge success through that.
"Moody 4B" of the practised saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the Keyboarders John Beasley belong to the competitors Iyers among other things.
Trombone Shorty, a robbery-united favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," Contemporary jazz in which otherwise white poplars are rather to be found by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber was distinguished in the category.
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk-musician Darcy James Argue received in the category major group presumably earned attention. He competes thus with the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber-jazz and the adventure-merry Dave Holland and his octette that Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bass player as a democratic Bandleader.
Grammy-nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical period categories
The classical period nominations for the 53rd Grammy-Award contain a colored Mix at musicians and composers from all world.
The list is led by Michael Daughertys "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestra work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to south-California the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony is no. 4 "of Los Angeles." This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonikern and 2009 in the Walt Disney Concert Hall uraufgeführt.
That in L.A. resident composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical period nominations are divided up in 13 categories, of orchestra, opera, choir up to solo photos.
In the category of the classical period producers five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical period nightmares Bruckners symphonies are Nr. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Rot orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by different artists; and Verdi's "requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.

Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous promise of the local planning committee after a five hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics reproached the project to support both the terrorism and traffic jams.
However according to a statement of the commission of the Wednesday evening, the new religion center corresponds to the local regulations and an aesthetic eye appeal will become.
"The project is supported by many good people - of Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," declared Hadi Nael, chairpersons' of the Islamic center of Temecula Valley on Thursday tomorrow.
"As an American that makes me proud."
It shows, that there is justice."
"There are only few opponents," he still added.
"You are only very much loud."
"In this valley wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center almost lasted until midnight at which the voices were quite evenly distributed on both pages according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate kept on being led on the web page of the newspaper.
"There is not any America anymore," a comment said.
"It is another planet of the monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty lies in a dead way in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic Centers led to protests also in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the town of New York on 11th September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for nonviolence.
His municipality with approx. 135 families lives for years peacefully in the Riverside County. However they wanted a larger and better to locating, as the warehouse that they rented together with a manufacturer for water filter installations.
The new one, approx. 2.300 m2 big mosque in the mediterranean style is supposed to have two minarets and become about 13 m high.
They is supposed to arise on that approx. 17.500 m2 large plot at the Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still make objection to the project with the town council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could facilitate new ways of life on the earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterium kind which can live on arsenic among other things opens new possibilities for new ways of life on the earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on the earth, it is according to their opinion a sign for a life also without the elements up to now taken as vital being possible.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic for the increasing."
"That turns it into something very Special in spite of its being almost a kind of foreign way of life," declared Paul C.W. Davies of that one Arizona State University and co-author of the report that appears on Thursday in the online edition of the magazine Science.
Up to now six main elements were considered as vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, as the scientists found out, the bacterium also still keeps on growing in the Californian mono brine if it replaces phosphorus by arsenic.
"Nevertheless there one wonders what otherwise still is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar by that one to Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step during the search for extraterrestrial life since scientists must recognize lives and his forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes which were found on the earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details for the discovery were announced gave reason to widespread speculations in the Internet, that the report could deal with the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "it "shows" declared Charles Cockell that in other planetary systems organisms with the aid of other elements biochemical processes can get going and that" the 'standard elements' that are completely vital in our opinion "are" not "absolutely firmly set," professor at the Planetary and space Sciences Research institutes of the Open university of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not a part of the research team.
"This work is a Novum, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by another" added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiologischen Institut of the NASA which led the study chose the mono brine due to the high arsenic salary.
Since arsenic and phosphorus resemble chemically, she picked up that microbes which are exposed to both can replace an element by the other one possibly.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is based particularly on its behaving chemically similarly as phosphorus."
"Through that it falls to the organisms heavily to distinguish an element from the other one."
"Nevertheless the difference that arsenic works differently than phosphorus is so great. It reaches our biochemical system, where it smears everything as it were," declares Anbar.
The researchers released the bacterium GFAJ-1 of an increasing arsenic concentration. It was adjusted and increased.
The microbe grows indeed into phosphorus better, however, that it can survive also in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based way of life can occur of course either on the earth or on another planet or moon on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, university lecturer for microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by Arsen is not new. However, up to now there was not yet any functioning example.
Arsenic occurred in the early earth years more frequently, she says, therefore the science assumed that early ways of life had used it.
"That gives" Forster, who was not a member in Wolfe-Simons research team, "reason for the assumption that life can have developed also differently than in the early earth age" so.
The studies were supported by the NASA, the energy ministry and the National Health Authorities.
Remaining stolen exhibition dogs found in Comptons
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that were stolen before a Bellflower-Motel were found sheriffs of the Thursday according to the Los Angeles county.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when strangers stole Chevrolet Express-Van in which the animals were before a Bellflower motel 6 at night placed from the 2006, so the authority statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, declares.
"The good information is: the dogs are fine," according to Whitmore.
"You are in good repair."
"They were returned to their lawful owners."
Whitmore did not turn any exact information to the place of finding of the dogs into the circumstance which led to their discovery yet.
"The investigations still run."
"We would not like to say more with regard to that," declares Whitmore.
"We follow some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
You received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district animal home in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs at different places in Comptons.
The Akitas - trace, a 3-year old male dog, and Didi, a 10 months old bitch - were unharmed according to authority statement.
Nevertheless the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners on the competition, kept on until Wednesday Evening missing.
There were Peek and Rickard which live in talking-thing at this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in the city in Long Beach because trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times informed on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba-show at other competitions.
South-California is a stop on the almost one month long tour of the pair from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening Peek and Rickard in the motel checked themselves in.
You stay at motels the night frequently and park their van before their room window.
You took along three more dogs - a boxer pup, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was there cooler.
You let the window to a slit widely openly so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard announced their car on Tuesday at 6:00 o'clock as stolen.
Peek promised a finder's reward to everyone who can give a reference to the Corgis. Microchips for the identification were implanted to the animals.
On Thursday was not yet certain, whether a finder's reward is paid.
The lion roars again according to judicial permission of the MGM-restructuring
According to 18-month long turbulences and insecurities MGM got now at last green light for a new start.
A New-Yorker bankruptcy judge blessed on Thursday that one offiziel Gläuberplan "prepares" off, around which to pay off debts at the level of $5 Mrd and to smooth the way for the 86-year long conversation enterprise for new films and variety shows.
According to the statements of the Thursday the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the management of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing more in the way stands. Barber and pear tree will protrude to the studio a little slimmed down as main managers.
The employee number is lowered by more than 400 on approx. 320.
For MGM Chapter 11 comes into force first in fact if JPMorgan Chase has finished a planned loan of $500 Mio for the financing of the new MGM-productions.
At the moment a consortium of the investment bank which brings in even $75 Mio, the enterprise, leads. The financing is supposed to stand until middle December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the task onto the investment bank Mölis & Co to help the management which fought with interest payments at the level of $300 Mio/year at the solution of their financial problems.
In August the manager Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO with Enron and restructuring expert that became known through his activity with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Mölis & Cooper to solve the finance worries MGMs and to pay out the more than 140 Gläuber of the studio lasted longer than expects.
After discussions lasting for months the parties decided at the end of 2009 on offering the enterprise for the purchase.
Nevertheless the auction attracted only few bidders and Mrd did not want to pay any the $2 demanded by the believers.
In the spring this year's all of front began, than the MGM team began with the redesign plan that was signed by the believers after debates lasting for months and internal quarrels at the end of October at last.
If MGM has survived the bankruptcy officially in the next weeks, Mölis and Cooper for their work receive a bonus at the level of several millions of dollars.
The part for Mölis & Co., that already kept $1,2 for Mio, amounts to $9,5 Mio.
Co-opera, to whom for the management of the enterprise $375.000 was paid monthly, Mio receive a "success bonus" of $4.
Barber and pear tree to intend to resume the production at MGM. This year the studio brought out only a film and created a year plan with seven or eight films that are supposed to come into the cinemas at the beginning of 2012.
Further they plan two films after "The small Hobbit" in co-production with warner Bros.
The studio needs for this purpose a separate loan for his financial part of these two films which are supposed to arise under the direction of Peter Jackson between $265 Mio to $275 Mio.
The investor Carl Icahn that financed approx. 18% of the MGM loan attempted a fusion of the studio with Lions gate entertainment whose tallest stockholder he is.
Nevertheless the last negotiations between the two enterprises did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys holds your present budget in the balance
The this year's favorite among the presents is the iPad, possibly followed from a Microsoft Kinect Videokonsole. Both games can tear a considerable hole into your present budget.
An iPad tastes so much as five BMX wheels for $99, during the price for a Kinect game about 10 classical jumping-ropes or approx. 48 cans Play-Doh corresponds.
But you can protect your present budget.
Recently I visited three national toy traders in search of three electronics toys under $80 - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Of Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I realized immediately that Moores law had come into force. This year the technology toys are more efficient and cost simultaneously a little less than in the last year.
And although less new toys with own web page appear, a wider offer is found on the best known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
Comes more and more button cell-practiced toys onto the market, and many contain wiederaufladbare accumulators.
Here unites recommendations.
(If not different indicated, all prices of Toys are "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs that sing a note if one presses onto their stomach.
To press once corresponds to a note, through repeated pressing one can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Respect: If you have begun with the pressing once, you can not stop anymore.
For a combination of Gesand and dance the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On basis of the Elmo Live-Technologie developed in the last year the animatronische doll offers interplay as 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheel blocking it dominates the Moon-Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. Your parents complained, however, about the missing volume control.
If you are a child of the eighties, you remember certainly Alphie, one of the first computerized learning-toys.

Police actions in China become gentler
As a training officer Tang Shenbin strode over an urban place, checked his nervous subordinates and gave in this case commands with military Authorität and lowered voice.
He wanted his feminine members of the Chengguan - China's robust guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their inclination for the power - to impress the spectators.
"Answer!"
"Look straight ahead"!
"Shows to them," he whispered to them "as pretty girls are so"!
Four girls, hardly the teenager age entwachsen, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and trousers stood tight.
Four pairs of black court shoes stood in straight row.
Four tidy hats were perfectly on that with blue-white striped bows held hair.
"For me they look average" Mr Tang notices contemptuously.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments attempted already to polish up the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city all new applicants must have a college end.
The province Guangdong imported a radiantly blue uniform instead of the grey-green one.
Wuhan in central-China replaced power by low stiffness: In 2009 50 officials circled according to reports a snack car properly not put forward and stared at the operator until this packed after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a municipal district in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would like to change the image basically.
Since 2003 13 women intensify the urban police cars. You were selected specific due to their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
You are supposed to give a softer, feminine aspect to the gross police.
However, unfortunately also Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad picture which the Chinese of these city commands have.
With right, so the critics.
Differently than the police officials may put through the urban laws these only with the aid of fines or other administrative punishments.
Nevertheless the Chinese media show another picture routinely.
In January 2008 officials beat a spectator to death in the province Hubei when this filmed it with his mobile at how they suppressed a protest action against a dump.
In the last year a training manual of the Pekinger officials was stolen and published in the Internet. In that it is described how delinquents without bloodsheds can be beaten up.
This year a Shanghaier watermelon trader suffered brain injuries after a brawl with five officials.
A video game bristling with power, that from the Internet can download, shows in China trained officials at an attack on barrowmen.
"Chengguan frightens the government," the national newspaper complained China Daily in the last year, after further controversies concerning the tactics.
The newspaper required a "really thorough purge."
Sceptic are the present approach for clearly inadequate.
When the Distrik in October by advertisement searched eight feminine recruits, an Editorial put news into the Beijing Evening the question whether the women would have real tasks or are supposed to be used only as optical diversion.
Probable both.
According to job advertisement women were searched in the age by 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonious features."
You should be large above average - over 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 customs.
The employment relation ends with attaining of the 26th year.
According to the officials the activity is physically too hard for women over 25.
"The most important is their image," an unnamed district official served with the quasi government web page Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, as size, weight, features, and so forth
Then temperament and "internal qualities" come.
"Is feminine Chengguan as flower vases," he said and added, "nevertheless in addition they still have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy conductor of the municipal administration of the district, would not like to agree with this description,
admitted, however, that in China size handicaps are not uncustomary in job advertisements for two kinds of sex.
The same one is valid for regular features.
Whether that is to be equated with good appearance is controversial in China.
But people with hindrances or physical deformations do not need to apply.
"We can use" here more leider no cripples or hunchbacks," according to Mr Zheng.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, that of a cloister near on the Baoguang place patroliert, is 22, has Apfelbäckchen and a presumably shaped mouth.
They empfindetes not than sexist, that so big value onto their appearance is put.
"You think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic look.
Your colleague with the dimples, the 21-year old Xu Yang, comments On "our having the task of representing the image of the city."
According to your information they do not regret the short attitude since they would have more ambitious career plans than simply to chase only traders through the lanes in order to hinder her at the business-doing.
Every morning the patrol deals with approx. twelve barrowmen that attempt on foot or to sell many rolls and Tofugerichte if possible on the bike before they are chased away.
"Herr Wang, you disappear here please."
"We already so often said that to you"! Ms Xu declares to a trader, that had fled on foot and in this case his attached on a bike cart noodle kitchen temporary in the prick had let.
According to the officials the activity is monotonous rather than hard.
"It is almost every day the same one," declares Huang Jing, 20, that studies marketing beings in the leisure time.
"Everything routine."
A reason for that is, that the feminine officials may confiscate the goods of the traders not, as their masculine colleagues.
You can threaten delinquents only with announcing it to their masculine superiors.
That is supposed to protect her against public ill will to which officials are frequently misfired in China.
Hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the province Yunnan, rampaged this year after the rumor circulated, Chengguan officials would have killed a trader.
More than one dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were hurt during the nocturnal incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or fire was set to them.
Xindu kept on from such power outrages being spared to up to now.
However, riots are not to be excluded.
Only two blocks removes from the quiet Baonguang place, at which the feminine officials at this morning patroulierten, more than 50 persons met at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, that was repaired towards the rules on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15-minute hesitation the officials with grim face cleared the way to their vehicles and left with the motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the masculine patrol, stayed behind. At in order to remain anonymous it turned round his white label.
As their colleagues the coordinators - men above 40 - play a role supporting in that.
However, they were not trained in presenting a clean image.
"Sometimes we go ahead verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," Mr Li declares soberly.
"The people with the quarrel begin most time."
Public prosecutor will not accuse senator Ensign
Public prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice absolved senator John Ensign from the accusations which were raised against it after his Affaire with a former choice helper and his attempt to provide their husband with a lobby activity, announced the attorneys of the senator on Wednesday.
This decision ends the hardest right reproach against senator Ensign, the republican from Nevada. Up to the scandal, that provided headlines nationally and moved a damper to his career, it was regarded as a possible premiership candidate of the republicans for 2012.
As senator Ensigns announced to Büro, it was highly delighted about the judgment after the one year long investigation.
The ethic committee of the senate could impose, however, another Disziplarstrafe.
According to statement of Ensigns attorneys they were informed of the Ministry of Justice over that that the investigations were stopped against senator Ensign and that Not To Accuse any further in this matter are there.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethic-attorneys outside of the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion there were sufficient proofs of Ensign disregarding the Lobbying-prohibition.
Interviews, E-Mails and other documents that were disclosed to the erstenmal in October 2009 in the New York Times gave reason to the supposition that to Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election officers, to lucrative tasks helped in order to buy his silence over an Affaire with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was active during a choice campaign of Ensigns as a treasure master.
Ensign contacted to some political friends in order to provide Hampton Arbeit. According to the documents and interrogations it took over lobby work for them after the attitude Hamptons.
Since Hampton was a choice team recently still in Ensigns, was it was not allowed to take over any lobby work for a year for his former employer or the entire senate.
According to ethic-experts the unusual agreement offended between Ensign and Hampton which were before the Affaire eng befreundet against the so called prohibition of the Drehtür-Lobbykratie.
According to the published indications "it is" a question "according to all appearance of an agreement and of the violation of the revolving door statutes," according to Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney which people specialized on the defense of clients which people stand in the visor of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice was refusing it officially to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign-case, Mr said. Fire and other ethic attorneys, the ministry shines very cautiously from defeats that were pursued by the media with great interest in the picking up of political accusations after a great number, including the decision in the last year to make the accusation against the former senator Ted Stevens because of error behavior on the part of the public prosecutor fall.
Public prosecutors "are obviously nervous," said Melanie Sloan, the chairperson of the union of "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization that objective is the abatement of corruption in parliament and government circles of the USA), a group of lawyers, To Accuse the different one against Mr. Ensign in court has brought.
"That means fundamentally that superior government officials can assume now that the laws do not apply to them" she added.
Paul Coggins, main defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he received on Monday a call of a public prosecutor and another on the next day, in which he was informed that the ministry will not raise any complaints against his client.
Mr. Ensigns defenders had co-operated with the public prosecutors in order to convince her of that that the senator has acted," as his office repeated in a declaration on Wednesday once again, "in agreement with the law.
Mr. Coggins refused to explain the legal arguments which he had put forward opposite the public prosecutors in a more exact way.
"To me is not presumably at going into the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: We believe to have made the correct decision," he said.
Last month the federal choice commission decided on stopping the investigations because of a separate complaint through the ethic group after which a payment of $96,000 of Mr. To expel Ensigns onto the Hamptons parents against the federal choice law has.
The choice commission said, it did not give enough proofs that the money was something else than a present.
NV Energy, a big company in Nevada, the long time the senator supported, one of the companies was, in which Mr. Hampton thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyisten-Arbeit found.
An E-Mail of December 2008 proves, that, after the company Mr. Hampton than lobbyist brought, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had in which it informed him that he "contacts" with the Ministry of the Interior because of a thing.
Mr. Ensign was in addition with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, to the lunch agrees and asked the Minister of Transport for arranging a meeting on behalf of the airline, after this Mr. Hampton for the purpose of lobby work had prepared.
When last year for the first time information passed about this affair at the public, Mr apologizes. Ensign with his voters and his position in the senate gave up, where it had been in the order of priority of the republicans at fourth place.
After it had not become noticeable anymore many months, Mr told. Ensign two weeks ago reporters, that it strives a third term of office in the senate.
In the announcement, that Mr. His press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, declared not to be Ensign longer the objective of police enquiries, the senator hopes for the ethic commission following the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and stopping his investigations.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire-appointment makes attentive on Twitter
Half a dozen of them typed in the riots in the courtroom away.
In the minute time they sent their reports above Twitter about horrible testimonies.
At the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140.000 Twitter-announcements about the process around rape and children chained to beds in a house which opened in flames.
On Thursday the attentively pursued process of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused, finds three members a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed, an official end if the judgment falls about the death sentence that the jury expressed.
However, Mr. Hayes attorneys submitted already requests near court which reasons for an appointment explain and which will employ the courts onto years.
That one is one of the provozierendsten reasons, that it has come through the intense reporting about the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter through average reporters - to a "circus atmosphere" and one so far spread, going around penetration incendious details', so that the jury was influenced by the public indignation in improper manner.
This objection could lead the Appelationsgerichte to occupying oneself with the question whether to made the new technologies new rules in the courtroom become necessary.
"So as I experienced it during this process, I believe that it is really a danger if the entry of the new technologies into the courtroom influences the right of every individual to a fair process," Thomas J. Ullman, Mr, said. Hayes main defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Uppermost Chamber Court, rejected last week the requests by decision succinctly, than he said, that the New Media carefully would become, and that it would not give any proof of that that the jury was driven from passions.
However, that was not the last word with security in this thing yet.
Since decades court objections have stated that the reporting makes about famous-notorious cases doubts about the fairness of a process arise.
In his historical decision of 1966 the Uppermost court of justice of the United States canceled the judgment to an osteopath from Cleveland that is supposed to have killed his wife against Dr. Sam Sheppard, and it said in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media.
Some believes, that the TV series and the feature film "on the Run" based on this crime.
Some lawyers say, court objections, which Mr. To consider Hayes later condemnation half a century, could follow the argument that new rules became necessary in order to control the communication paths from the courtroom that were still inconceivable in the case's Dr. Sheppard times.
"There is a good reason to be worried about the influence of the New media in processes that are pursued by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at the Stanford Law School that examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report it is imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated from the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication could make out of the courtroom the processes fairer.
The Twitter matter is only one of many, that the lawyers of Mr. Explaining Hayes in order to discuss onto years and to put off a condemnation thus.
The defenders also claim for example, that Mr. Hayes already would be condemned could, than judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential Juroren when one showed them horrible scene photos during the Jurorenauswahl.
Some of the Juroren said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have given her disgust.
The defenders say, they would question also the constitution moderateness of the death penalty constitution, and they argue, that the judge exchanged by mistake a Juror that a critic was to the prosecution and that it would have carried out improper manner pressure on the judgment, than it had made the uncustomary decision to reserve the jury over the weekend.
The Juroren were not isolated.
Maybe the greatest interest draws nevertheless their arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting about the process onto itself.
In a judgment contestation that they submitted last month they stated that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate.
You argued, that the New Media would have provoked the flames of the emotions again continuously about the case.
Maybe "one" did not experience "such daily crush of the media beeps, cameras and reporters outside of the courtroom" even nationally yet "before still," the lawyers wrote, "in New Haven and."
Your emphasis onto the reporting through Twitter is controversial.
In interviews some journalists said, that the claim, this direct news is aufwieglerischer as reports that are refunded more slowly a technique-hostile look is that the reporting about future processes becomes impoverished.
Nevertheless some lawyers said Appelationsgerichte would be confronted often with the argument, social and technical changes would need the adaptation through the courts.
Mr. Hayers lawyers intensify this claim.
In their objection they related themselves to the decision of the Uppermost court of justice of 1966, in which the condemnation was canceled by Dr. Sheppard due to the reporting and did clear, that the New Media require new rules.
"These case, so they wrote, Sheppard represents against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can politeness combine the separating thing?
After a campaign at swearwords and Negativität little politeness broke out this week in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real two party cooperation or a factor of the illusion before one returns quickly again for the fight of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and spitzes of the congress did not bring any breakthrough in the great questions which one had to occupy oneself with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decisions anymore are made.
After all to the, what one hears, was not to rule over it either a polite discussion between two different pages or an observation of their divided responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party dot compiling.
The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was likewise civilized, in spite of the political differences that keep on existing between the members.
It seems to be clear that a narrow communication makes over a period of months a mutual respect that the ideological fissure that keeps on separating the members from each other veils arise.
That is not hardly enough in order to say a new era of the cooperation broke.
Both pages are now in a test phase - in which one of the other sign of the cooperation and compromise willingness demands while one himself is attempting to consider the borders of the public opinion and the patience the voter after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore the meeting on Tuesday itself and his assessment were restricted through the participants onto a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too great and too deep, than that one could expect a fast change of the atmosphere that predominated in the last two years.
Identical whether it is a question of taxes, donations, health or candidacies, the two pages are away of each other in a miles long way.
In the End the November choice Washington tuned at least for short time mild.
"No question, the accent changed itself," Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government that now for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works, said.
"That is after choices inevitable.
Choices raise party passions which again die.
And that is good so."
In some questions, especially in those which stand on the agenda of the "lame duck session" republicans and democrats do not have hardly another choice than to find a solution."
Bushs tax abatement ends at the end of the year, and nobody approves that.
Both pages want to find a way, around some or quite all too keeps, it is now temporary or durable.
In the same way a compromise is to be expected concerning the increased unemployment pays, when also only, because the republicans can not afford it, that one believes, the favored tax abatement for the rich men, while they are refusing unemployed workers a support.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House the optimism increased, that one can agree in these questions during the "lame duck session" and contract ratify also the New START simultaneously.
However William Glaston des Brookings Insitution warns against the lame duck session" not having to lead "a successful cooperation" to a durable cooperation of the parties compellingly "in urgent questions" if the new 112th congress will call in January.
Instead of this, so he says, a phase of the Nichtübereinstimmens is more probable, maybe even unavoidable.
"After the things which must be done are done, this short-term psychology will change in confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is divided by many - that leads politeness to true cooperation.
"I see as Vorkampf, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012 many things which happens from today to 2012," he said.
The reasons for that have to do a lot with the getup of the new republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters, that those one education were useful.
To know, as gotten the republican leaders like to be also over their playing poker too highly, it that they must attempt their promises, to lower the editions of the government and to annul the health reform, to stop.
These party lines already in the first reactions concerning the recommendations become clear to the deficit commission which a tax reform and the emphasis of some taxes as well as the increase of the retirement age and the lowering of the government expenditures contain.
The Deputy Chairpersons Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took over one of the most difficult jobs into Washington and have, according to their own assessment, so very much close on that to put the deficit question on the public agenda.
To need it, however, within the commission 14 of the 18 voices, around their plan to the to do official recommendation and they fight very much in order also to come only into the proximity of this number.
The biggest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the committee, there in finance questions, at least today, only little elbow room or little sympathy for compromises is.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the republicans in the congress.
The first fight will occur next year in the form of party collisions, when the republicans challenge Obama with regard to the national budget, the taxes and the health system, later then followed from a phase of greater two party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proved, that, in spite of the partiality of the current choice, the majority of the Americans still always wants, that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end as it happened in 1995 then both parties must pay attention to the public reaction carefully.
Who is condemned to the losing will change the course and will search will have the compromise.
That likes to be in fact an optimistic viewpoint.
Partiality and polarization are today greater than in the middle of the 1990th years, and to seem it to be a bigger ideological fissure between Obama and the congress republicans than at that time between president Bill Clinton and the republicans.
Simultaneously the activists of both parties see as a pure prelude by far in 2010 for one at consequence more comprehensive choice 2012.
So seen the politeness which is borne this week for the show likes to be welcomed by many Americans.
However very much more effort will require on both pages, to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two from each other.
Moscow portrays seeped US document as a harbor of the corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Kleptokratie" and she passes on a part of the bribes and the protection money which she collects to the Kremlin. So the American message told in February in Russia in a Memo.
Both police and the Staatssicherheitsdienst extort high protection money so so that they can hold their expensive standard of living in Moscow it is said.
You collect money not only of legitimized businesses, but also of organized criminal bands.
Every shift of the bureaucracy - what prime minister Vladimir Putin referred to as "A perpendicular of the authority" - takes his part of the money that the ladder moves up.
The Memo which was sent to Washington under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his home page.
The Memo is based on sources whose names were revised.
It was written, during Yuri Luzhkov Moscow's mayor was still, and accuses him of the corruption.
It was fired in October by president Dmitry Medvedev, however, there is not hardly a proof of people having tidied up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a known building firm, rejected corruption reproaches again and again over years, and he won numerous slander complaints against such accusations.
In September it declared a Russian television broadcast station it is corrupt when he was asked for a documentation which suggests: "It is mad, it is dirty, it is dirty."
> An incredibly great number at Russians believe, that their society is corrupt. Inquiries showed that.
But it is unusual that, happened as in the report of the ambassador, single persons are named, and it is unheard that this happens through a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the government of Moscow with the criminality it resulted for this purpose in the government rather acting as a Kleptokrat that some designate it as "faulty" and come to the conclusion than a government," according to the Memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy one "kryshna" (a concept from the world the criminals / the Mafia, what in a word for word way means "roof" or protection), that above the police, the state security (FSB), the service inspectorate (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor just as extended as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands at uppermost place."
"FSB, MVD and the militia stand on the second stage."
"Last the vulgar criminals and the criminal inspectors on the lowest stage follow."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some fields because the city does not offer any help."
The report passes on, that the FSB money of the biggest companies takes the money and that the police arrests small businessmen.
A source, so is called, "declared that Moscow's proprietors understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (and not of the organized crime) since they have not only more arms, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected through the law."
"For this reason the protection is through criminal walk's no more as in demand as formerly."
The Memo notices, that, while the compiling of the money is being comprehensive, to be the protection itself very modest no; even the ones who pay are arrested sometimes.
Those that do not pay find their business very quickly closedly - due to the one or other pretext's.
Medvedev talked repeatedly about opposing the corruption, said, however, simultaneously that it did only little progress.
The Memo of the message contains descriptions of men, that go with with suitcases that were presumably full of money into the Kremlin.
"In his fight against the corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of when, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he is a part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not a part of the political class because a political class does not exist in Russia anymore."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of the powers, so he says, corruption is inevitable.
National, so estimates when, the corruption Russia costs more than $ 300 billion per annum.
The country shunts on place through the nonstate organization Transparence International in 154 of a newer investigation for the global perception of the corruption (countries are performed of "the least corruptly" too "the most corruptly").
The disclosure of the Memos of the American message that happened after Moscow time late in the evening will activate disgust with security within the Russian government, although it can be also a possibility since Luzhkov can be accused for the errors of Moscow for the Kremlin to say that one solves the problems.
Claimed in an interview with Larry King for CNN Putin, that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted furiously to the disclosure, that American diplomats mentioned it Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is" a question "of our communication which is an important factor of the inside politics in this country," he said.
"Aber in order to be honest, we would not have expected that this happened to such arrogance with such pressure and in so unethical way, you know."
Khmer rouge forced to veterans for the confrontation with the past
In a weakly illuminated, concreted classroom with walls dirty and flaking off, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds leaders Ta of the man that uplifted it at the later Khmers Rouge Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Confessed because of his brutality during Khmer Rouge domination as "the butcher," the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the north-west of Cambodia, where it hospitals and bridges built, which developed infrastructure and where thousands' of former soldiers still always live.
Nevertheless this year, of 12 years according to the capitulation of the Khmers Rouge opposite the government, long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April a local truth and conciliation forum allowed the victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June the government distributed a school book which for the first time the history of Khmers Rouge tells to children of former soldiers.
And in July a community tribunal of the UNO and Cambodia condemned for the first time a former member of Khmers Rouge, than it the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng Folterkammer, Kaing Khek Iev, better known than Duch, to 35 years of prison condemned.
With each of these developments the fear increased to veterans Alnlong Vengs under Khmer Rouge, complicated their endeavours towards conciliation and re-integration into the society of Cambodia.
"There are still refusal and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they do not have any power to do something," said Chhang Youk, conductor of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them the life was glorious under Khmer Rouge, but the regime became a symbol of the evil."
"It divides up even families."
During the Khmer rouge domination in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1,7 million people were exekutiert or they died of illnesses, reworking or for hunger.
When the Vietnamese came in and in 1979 those ones flung pole Pot-Ied Regierung, the remains of the regime and his military fled onto the border of Cambodia according to Thailand.
Here they spread noise until December 1998 when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their basis in the west of the mountains and jungles from Cambodia, Ta Mok drew the next generation in Anlong Veng.
However in the middle of the 1990th years, when led a peace agreement supported through the UNO in 1993 to the first democratic choices of the country, great groups of Khmer Rouge Fighters began to overflow to the government, which led to the capitulations from Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 a natural death's, and Ta Mok that had not given in was arrested in 1999 of government strengths with the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he waited for his process.
When their patrons did not protect her longer more, most former Khmers fled rouge fighter into the zermürbende poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Also when of a few kept elitist official of Khmers Rouge their local government posts because they laid down their arms the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people profited only very much little by the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the center for justice and conciliation which holds public forums in whole Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng
"You are anchored into the utopian Agrarideologie of the regime."
"You grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, of 55 years, who had connected himself in 1974 as teenagers of the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he sat down in 1998 in order to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"The life under Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Eating something gave everyone Ta Mok."
"However now the life is difficult because we must take care of ourselves ourselves."
The walking Khmer rouge tribunal called worries also here in an awake way.
At the beginning of next year that attempts court's, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to put in court.
It is the task of the court to condemn the old leaders and those ones that are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
That helped little to moderate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations are had on In the Chaem, 64 year, concentrated, which during the Khmer rouge domination in the late 1970th years district leader had been in the province Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007 she had told to representatives of the documentation center of Cambodia it led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms a project, at the thousand of mandatory workers presumable died.
At a hot evening came back In the Chaem from the work to the fields to their wooden house at a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun flung long shadows onto the verdorrte grass In the Chaem it leaned, to discuss about their past with Khmer Rouge.
If the court should summons her, she would refuse so to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," she said.
If "there were not any pursuits anymore, war would be here."
Prime minister Hun Sen in addition repeated that fled in 1878 of Khmer Rouge warned against the situation becoming unsure the court would accuse more suspects although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do in order to be able to go forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Conciliation with the Khmer-times means collating of the broken pieces," he said.
It is our duty so to set these broken parts together that as everything can understand."
The center created the first school book approved by the government about Khmer Rouge, the 75-sided "history of the Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the education ministry which contains less than four pages about Khmers Rouge.
To know as often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng only little about the Khmers Rouge, in spite of the connections of the city to the regime.
Understanding an important part of their history said to Touch Valeak, of 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, that the new school book helps the students.
But his parents reacted sceptically, in order to read it, than it the book with home brought.
"My family leans many parts of the book and the court off," he said.
"You are mistrustful because they are not sure as many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance does the conciliation process in a complex way and complicatedly, said Sok Leang.
He said "To attain the public forums, the school book and the court, however, after and after influence."
Still Khmer Rouge has a powerful attraction here.
Above in the Dangrek Bergen a way überwucherter from shrubs and dirtied with plastic garbage leads to a rectangle from black soot, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pots body had been burned here after his death 1998 on a tire heap.
Nuom Sothea, of 31 years, a mobile vendor at the street edge, said she does not know much about the man who had been burned here.
"Aber he went a strong spirit and many people here to it in order to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later on day it wanted to go to Pol Pots last resting-place, where she will lay down a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that it brings their luck.
Belarus is agreed on not keeping on collecting arm-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for president Obamas campaign to the worldwide protection of nuclear material the government announced from Belarus on Wednesday, which is a critical component of nuclear arms, that one will not collect more longer highly enriched uranium.
The deal was announced to the exterior minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Byelorussian foreign minister Sergei Martynov in a common statement after a meeting in an additional article of the security peak.
The US government had attempted for years to convince Belarus of that not to collect more highly enriched uranium and it seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
However official of the US government told to the Washington mail that in the last two months two secret agreements were hit with Belarus in order to remove 187 pounds of arm-capable uranium from a Byelorussian research institution.
That prepared the stage for the accord on Wednesday, to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee that remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obamas To "Nuclear security peak of the 47 nations" of April that had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough in order to safeguard the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next peak 2012.
"I was really enthusiastic of the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear security peak (of 2012)."
"That proves to me that it functions," said Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of Global Security, a group for the promotion of the nuclear security.
Clinton named the agreement "a very significant, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to safeguard all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then the US government helped six countries with becoming their highly enriched uranium loosely.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen of countries put it under the government from George W. Bush.
At this time Security Peak Nuclear of Obamas the Byelorussian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared, that the nation will give up never their uranium.
"As keep highly enriched uranium -" Lukashenko said "hundreds of kilos, what is basically arm-capable, and less enriched uranium," then.
"That is our raw material... We will not make any dirty bombs from that and we will not sell it to anybody."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that is everything."
Nevertheless Belarus approximated to the USA few months ago, when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first run, to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was especially complicated because the material was light verstrahlt, say official.
It was loaded into a special train, that more than 1.300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, official say.
The second run was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official ones by airplane.
The US government pays $ for these efforts to 14 million at which a majority of the money flows into the Byelorussian research with weakly enriched uranium which can not be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely cautiously coordinated and synchronized in order to establish confidence" that led to the descendant that was signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the energy ministry that works on the Global Danger Reduction, said.
The James Martin Zentrum for studies not to be passed on estimates, that Belarus had this year of at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium as well as hundreds of pound at highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dissolve his warehouse according to the common descendant to 2012.
The relationships between Belarus and the USA were for years strained, in the first place because of Lukashenkos harsh disregard the human rights'.
But the statement of the Wednesday suggests a possible approximation.
"The progress of these global security questions welcome being called, the United States of America and Belarus announce, that an increased respect for the democracy and the human rights have a central topic in Belarus in the improvement of the bilateral relationships and it is essential for the progress of the country and his citizens," she declares.
No objections of the Spanish government against CIA-flights
The Spanish government did not have any objections to the CIA flights with Taliban- and Al-Qaida-caught about Spanish state field after Guantánamo, as from a telegram of the ambassador of the USA. in Madrid follows.
The documents seen of Wikileaks enhüllten and onto the daily paper "El País" (by cables) reflect that. It is added that the former deputy head of the government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded the Spanish government is supposed to be informed "in order to prove that foreign airplanes which fly over Spain are controlled adequately."
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid to human rights-despising practices in a Duzend was accused countries, under that also Spain, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The deputy head of the government added, the report of the council affected Zapatero in the offside and confirmed, Spain does not have to hide anything in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined Spain does not have any objections to the secret service flights about Spanish state field."
"You" would only simply like "to be informed" in order not to be surprised in an unprepared way, tells Aguirre by cables.
Also the former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government of "this matter does not want to give any great attention although the government has only few influence possibilities since these would lie in the hands of the judges."
The public prosecutor Vicente González made to the message understand for his part in January 2007, that it the judicial initiative which to apply for would not block Deklassifizierung of the documents of the Spanish secret service headquarters (CNI) and the defense minister about the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any loading or sensitive information," declared the ambassador after a conversation with the public prosecutor.
In spite of that the USA about the "apparent coordination were more worried "between the Spanish public prosecutor and the German public prosecutors" than about the deklassifizierte information of the CNI's and the Ministry of Defense's.
"This coordination between independent lower seekers becomes our efforts for the discrete use between governments verkomplizieren," Aguirre laments.
At a lunch in March 2007 which the ambassador of the USA and the Spanish Minister of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated in latter commented, that "although the Spanish judges are concerned about their independence insanely strongly and would do what they hold for appropriate" it his employees instructions has given, "to avoid in order to make the tension fade "blown up rhetorical comments."
The ambassador expressed also his concern on the approach of the PP in this matter.
"In spite of their in general pro-American attitude our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt about that from a tip, that the government Zapateros tolerates actions of the USA that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights or ignored them deliberately, capital will beat even if these disclosures could affect the government of the USA negatively" he emphasizes.
The child murderess confesses she complained in the Internet about the "hardship" of the motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child, was as this already dead and she had one blog: "Terror in Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is in the Internet "Muki."
Under this surname, that they leads of small on, it holds contact with a cousin and at least a friend. They both come from Noia, a village in the province La Coruña in which she was born.
The communications are 2008 from the year.

It held a year.
In a word after it had solved their relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know whether the baby of it is, but his ex-con never made him carry out a DNA-analysis.
Already shortly afterwards she entered into another relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man, from Lousame, a neighbor municipality.
With it it long lived together time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went onto the Balearic Islands in order to look around on the labor market, the small one stayed with their partner who accompanied it for even a week according to Palma.
But it can be concluded from the contents of their news that their love relationship was broken and they separated.
In March 2008 it is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and acid because I came for the working."
"As I informed him of that, he found it good, however now he notices natural, what it means with the boy the whole day long only to be able to do to be and not to be free, and let which he would like."
Later she mentions a communication which she received just on the mobile: "I would like, that you come back this month or to receive to me an address let, to which I can send you the boy."
She complains: "If he does not like that I let to the boy with my mother, I fetch it if I am back."
In May it speaks of the return into their village: "This week I go there, but I will stay only up to the 19th there because I must introduce myself at the 20th to a work if I do not want to lose that one."
It declares that she takes along their first-born if everything works well.
"He will be at that at which he must be that is, with me. Never in the life I become it again with somebody except for with my mother let," a doubtful intention, if one takes their bad relationship into account.
In July there is a further mail.
When she writes these, people go out from that that the boy who came to the island at the 1st of the month and was supposedly murdered at the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand it is with me and he likes the place a little, but on the other hand it must go every day into the school."
It speaks of a move to Majorca.
"There he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenditure on the nurse."
At the 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss of César who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says," he sent "me" to E-Mail any videos on the. You see if he wants he finds me, such manure."
At the 30th another one: "The boy is fine. It goes into a summer course in order to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, their present partner, there is one: "He advances me money."
In the Internet, in Anime- and Mangablogs, there are communications of it.
It even had one own blog in MySpace that is now spaced, and in that they "Muki, that" named "Gefängnisentlasserin."
"Terror a la gallega (Heading) ."
The last man who lived together with her, a vereidigter gamekeeper, declares to have twinges of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can not understand that everything happened because she had not told to him that she is a mother in an alone way raising.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the center by Palma for court prisoners on Menorca into the province prison.
The court-appointed counsel, Carlos Maceda, declared she can not remember the course of the facts and she did not have the intention to add to the Small Damage."
Before it had stood, however, drowned César in the bathtub and packed his corpse in a suitcase have.
Defense and prosecution applied for a psychiatric expert opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in the congress for this purpose and PSC lost 9
With the results of the 28th November the PP could play Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona in the cities a decisive role
According to the significant voice and representative increase at the last regional choices the PP already focuses their look on the parliament choices - preferred or not. Your expectations are more than positive, because the voice number which achieves this party at these choices is usually twice as high as those at the choices in Catalonia are.
So the Catalan people's party received 610.473 voices at the parliament choices of 2008, during this digit at the regional choices in the year 2006 only 316.222 was.
On the last Sunday the PPC achieved 384.091 voices.
If this tendency going up - result of the detour of the voice part of the PSC and the link of the electorate of the PP - should halt, the analysts of the PP predict, that at the parliament choices the PPC could climb up from 8 onto 12 congress representatives, while also CiU four (she has 10 now) would be winning and the PSC would be losing at least 9 representatives (of 25).
These calculations prove the basic importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the people's party the ERC would lose a representative - currently she has three - while ICV was can hold their representative or win one.
The choice calendar should be kept, however, the next appointment with the municipality choices falls in the 2011th May Also then the people's party (PP) can be the tongue at the scales in order to prepare an end for the socialist dominance, and indeed in four provincial capitals and with their majority in the town council of Barcelona, one of the municipal administrations with the greatest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the people's party agree, that the PSC the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which neither the socialists do not achieve a majority still to be able to access to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV), to lose becomes.
According to the republican collapse it is not erroneous that this party will lose their representation in the district council of Barcelona, in which it would have to achieve 5% of the voices.
On the other hand the PP recorded an increase of their voice part in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive strength in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced, the title role in Tarragonas change be able to play. There they had ruled before the present mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
The PP suits to En Lérida only 500 voices behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relationships to Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met repeatedly.
Also in other important places, as for example in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus the people's party could record a significant increase.
Currently the PP is represented in 34 municipal administrations of Catalonia and the education of lists strives in so many places as possibly.
The Catalan cell got Al Qaida thousands of passports
Except for the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis arrested by the policemen of the secret service place of the police of Barcelona and the Nigerian formed the dschihadistische cell operated from Thailand, that different Al Qaida groups, under that the "movement for the liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lax cirque e-Taiba" (Let) - latter was authoress of the assassination attempts in Bombay that required 2008 106 dead - with passports supplied.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior assigns a great importance that it is possible so far that he insures to these investigations with the "Operation Kampai" the forgery apparatus Al Qaidas "was weakened" worldwide and thus their action ability.
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where these were forged and sent after that onto the groups which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida consists of in this way whose "fighter" unpunished the borders of European and other western countries could cross.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the dschihadistischen net which was active in Europe. Therefore also other European police units participated except for the Thai investigation organs in the enquiries. Excluding is not that it will result in similar assassination attempts as the one that was exported on the last Tuesday in Barcelona on the field of the EU in the next days.
In coordination with this operation (that Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another at which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested was carried out in Thailand.
You had led from Bangkok the cell settled down in Spain and other European countries.
Pässe stole the Catalan net - a part of them had been done in the year 2009 to the ground - in particular from tourists according to the handicaps of the so called "International Islamic front."
That means that the documents had to be made out by men in the age of 25 to 45 years on the names and be valid still several years; they were not allowed to show any visa stamps.
In investigation circles it is underlined that to now no connections between the ones arrested in Catalonia and the assassination attempt in Bombay be proved could although the author of this assassination attempt, "Lax cirque e-Taiba" was, one of the receiver groups of the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
In spite of that should be reminded of some days in front of the assassination attempt from Catalonia by means of a money transfer enterprise several thousands of dollars that "were invested" in the purchase of Prepaid-cards for mobile telephones that later were used by the members of the "command" that prepared an end for the life of 106 persons having been sent.
The police confiscated an extensive documentation.
PP demands a prorogation of the tax agreement from Mas
The chairperson of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, perceived yesterday the occasion to present their conditions to Artur Mas personally for the support of his assumption of office as a Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These do not distinguish from the already during the election campaign set ones and make summarize with the Vorrangigkeit of the economical re-upswing and the refraining of regionalistischen independence adventures, as a finance compensation agreement, that the regionalistische leader wants to suggest on the climax of his mandate.
The chairperson of the Catalan people's party turned with the security to Artur Mas, which the 18 representatives that she had won on the last Sunday lent her - a digit that is more than sufficient in order to feel indispensable. Because the candidate of the middle class regionalistischen party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining during the vote with his assumption of office.
The future alliances which the regionalists want to enter into at the coming parliament choices in the congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. The conversations which Mas at this time with the remaining party leaders leads are, however, about Catalonia.
What affects the party chairperson of the PPC, so this demands, that to the support of the assumption of office "all discourses, which affect the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the finance compensation between state and the Autonomous region - similar as in the Basque Country - and that the party leader of CiU wants to submit even a referendum, to be done behind.
It is common to both political leaders that they make the political apparatus of the regional administration blown up more slender and want to abolish the inheritance and present tax.
With the details of the negotiations for the assumption of office of Mas occupy vonseiten the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas met already Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today it will come together with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric home confirms that the deaths are not to be put down to "missing measures"
The owners of the home for the elderly in Olot do not exclude that their nurse killed more than eleven older people
The persons responsible of the geriatric home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference in which they put out which damage had caused the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse that had killed during his work at least eleven old people for whom it was responsible - the equipment.
The conductor of the geriatric home, Joan Sala, performed in company of his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced, "La Caritat would like to accuse the person responsible (for the deaths) ," but "the right and our liability duty force us to that to accept "the process and the civil law liability."
The equipment does not have to accept only a social renown loss because she had not found the criminal actions of the nurse in time, but pay now also a high indemnity which is charged the dependant of the victims by the legal representatives.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that he killed since then further.
The judge arranged the exhumation from eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric home - since he presumed that no doctor examined the deceased personally, but the formalities were run due to their age and illnesses by telephone.
The conductor of La Caritat denied this point flatly and declared that "absent measures keinerzeit could have been the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there would not be any indications" in the lawsuit for negligent actions of another person as the accused person."
The one already Baptized as "A death angel" confessed eleven murders the day before yesterday and declared, the first crime on 29th August 2009 verübt and one months later the second old lady have murdered.
In This Case it killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime in the case of which he had given a mixture of different tranquilizers.
The conductor of La Caritat declared the access of the personnel to the medicines is to be controlled only heavily.
The insulin syringes and that the nurse fitted in tranquilizer cocktail from nine committed crimes at six in order to free the patients with the death from their suffering.
However the results of the laboratory research will present, whether Vila lies and chose for his first victims in fact one little cruel death or whether he burned out these from inside in his giving them paleness lye that he murdered between the 12th and 17th October as he had done it according to confession with three women.
In La Caritat one does not give any belief to the statements of the nurse, not even what does not affect the number of the stood murders that more could absolutely be. This attitude is justified with Vila having done very different statements in court and it not turning any sense to change his approach suddenly after eight successful murders.
You say they provided it for themselves for this reason and for the clarification of the range of these incidents of the justice.
Threatening-gestures of the European central bank (EZB)
The investors reacted yesterday sharply to the threat of the EZB president Trichet that warned, "our capability of reacting should not underestimate the markets."
The risk impacts of the Euro-Peripheriländer increased dramatic and the stocks of the European banks around more than 5%.
Nevertheless we should not underestimate the possibility that the EZB can deceive herself and the euro hardly increased points, which leads to the worry.
The events of yesterday are typical for a frozen market, that in the measure, in which it collapses again recovered, however due to the closing of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will long yet not lose his fear.
Today a month ago the European Central Bank asked us to cancel our Liquiditätmsassnahmen after what that EZB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still many must do Male in the future, a moving-snag.
The Federal Reserve demanded the ending of the plan for the purchase of national debts since these are ineffective as well as the cancellation of all extraordinary limited liquidity measures. Only a one week long unlimited access is supposed to be retained.
After the Ireland crisis we expect, that the present liquidity measures "at least extends "until March" and the quarterly announcements with unlimited access at the quarter end to the guarantee of the liquidity until at least June will retain.
We also expect, that the program to the purchase of obligations continued and will distribute a strengthening signal.
If the created expectations are not met, is reverberated the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday again and if halstarrig that is insisted on, that we to take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
In the same way as not to take the purchase of state fault papers into account during the EZB meeting in May in the case of which the bank confirmed and collapsed the markets then, this history could be repeated tomorrow.
The EZB must be credible and persistent.
In May it showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said to have bought already a lot with which it provoked a new breakdown of the market.
Yesterday the auction of one year long state titles was quite weak in Portugal.
The state property administration distributed only 500 million to 5,28%, opposite 750 million to 4,81% in the preceding auction.
In spite of that the interest rates fell into Portugal around 30 base points in the entire curve and reflected in this way a perception change of the markets according to the words Trichets.
In Ireland the numbers of the fault hole were published by Allied and Bank of Irish country.
The sum becomes at short notice on about 10 000 million and possible wider 15 000 estimated. There is time until February, in order to get private capital or to become these banks nationalizes.
Although Ireland completely lost his plausibility after the problem with the stress tests had not recognized it in July, the numbers are acceptable within the framework of the rescue plan and help with reducing the uncertainty.
However, the government must receive on the coming Tuesday the parliamentary approval for his new budget. Since it does not have the sufficient support yet, Ireland is also furthermore sources of the uncertainty.
Angela Merkel formed their discourse with regard to the peak of the heads of state and the government on 14th December moderater. There is political unit in demand in order to show that we play together the the same score.
The problem is, that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethovens.
The Spanish government president presented yesterday the measure plan which is supposed to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous regions as at the finance institutes, disassembly of the state deficit, liberalization, denationalization and work procurement measures. Measures which ring in the ears of the investors as Vivaldis Four Seasons.
The double effect explained to Zapatero and Trichet why the Spanish stock exchange put on about 4,5 percent doppelt so viel as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
In the comparison to February the reaction was fast and convincing to the government and to the Spanish central bank, and we profit by the surprise effect.
Today there is a leading auction of a three year long state loan which will profit from the Trichet-effect. Therefore we back on a strong demand which will remove all doubts about our debt rescheduling ability.
For Spain the ordering of an auxiliary plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros availably, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and the access to the markets would be locked without notice.
In spite of that woman should correspond to the motto of Caesar our strategy: "Now not only the existence, but also the appearance counts."
Only courage we create that!
The executive board chairperson of owls fight on request of his children the companion meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owners of the societies of owls and El Enebro, does not drop.
David Álvarez, founder of the Unternehmensgurppe, will trouble the companion meeting of El Enebro, who will occur on request of five of his seven children at the 16th, since he holds it for "completely vain." His children will attempt to receive a majority around the administration organs of the company - holder of the vinery Bodegas Vega Sicilia - control.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new justice chapter in their quarrel around the control of a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest holding companies for enterprise services seems to be not ready to give in his lawsuit around the control of the organs of El Enebro.
From the administration council he was knocked out by five of his seven children. These appointed themselves on the shareholders' meeting of the 18th January of this year, that in the commercial register already than troubled is entered, to administration councilors.
The companion meeting of El Enebro, who was called by the judge of the commercial court number 2 from Madrid for the 16th, activated a new clap of thunder in the lap of the family Álvarez.
The invocation of the judge to the Anberaumung of the meeting is the only juridical way which guarantees the calling of the companion meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz becomes of David Álvarez when one "despair means of the proposers laid out - his five children -, around by means of legal hairsplittings, fraudulent machinations and to make acknowledge the meeting of the 18th January declared as vain of right abuse," as official speakers declare.
This argumentation is the basis afterwards for the contestation of the meeting, around them than to declare "completely vainly."
The same protagonists who wrap themselves in discrete silence attempted in June already unsuccessfully to call a meeting on judicial way.
With El Enebro - property society and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, next to other capital values -' seven children 'control David Álvarez' 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand the founder of the service group demands the usage right according to family protocols over 51% of the capital.
That is the actual background of the thing which the judge has to decide on in the hearing for the treatment of the contestation complaint for which yet no date was defined.
Talk Bull triumphs in the F1 with a secret arm of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull 2004 penetrated the world of the formula 1, their history is shaped in this exquisite universe of the speed of surprises and successes.
At the beginning nobody gave the newcomer observation and in spite of his career going up steeply during the last seasons they all put on the victory of the Ferraris during the final spurt in last November from Fernando Alonso.
To want to reduce without the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the achievement strength of the engine of Renault is the "secret arm" that the Multi Siemens put Bull Red into the hands, and created a winner team in this way, become for the legend.
In reality is about an efficient software for the simulation from processes that the German enterprise launched in 2007 to purposes that do not have to do with motorraces.
This computer program referred to as PLM was used for the development by arrangement chains in factories on the whole world, energy works and high-precision instruments.
A true reproduction and/or simulation of a product or process is aimed at before in fact this is built in order to avoid so errors and superfluous costs.
PLM relieved the development of the cameras of Canon, the airplanes of Sukhoi and the most famous utility vehicles from Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, conductor of the industry department of Siemens, declares, that with the use of this software in the formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in few hours, almost in real time the changes and improvements that are found on the races and at the tests, project and can carry out."
Russwurm exports that in 1992 in the running-stables ten technicians who could introduce at most three or four improvements in a season worked on the average.
In Red Bulls team are today 180 highly qualified young people occupies. With efficient EDP equipment they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the racing cars.
The Siemens manager that is PLM software in the situation declared to analyze all components of the racing cars of Red Bull and improve, except for the engine for which Renault declares itself responsibly exclusively.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety members are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator thanks to advanced manufacturing plants and Hightech-autoclaves within less than 24 hours into the reality.
The 40 million dollars are the only border that is set to this mad technical perfectionism, that one formula 1 - team for his races in a season may distribute.
Talk Bull built up his Hightech factory for the development and production of his racing cars in a 50 kilometers of London remote place.
It is a question of two buildings in which visits are - especially of journalists - strongly delimited.
All which happens there is top Secret.
The staff grasps 580 persons, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and marks Webber.
But Red Bulls of true formula 1 - hero is the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell doubt-free.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the Energy drink manufacturer puts into the services of his participation on the grounds further protagonists hide themselves, whose support is inestimable and their fame same Zero.
The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey, stresses that one five years ago could still say that the progress contributed to the victory in the field F&E for racing cars with 50 percent and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the part values changed. The technology forms 85 percent of the success while the contribution of the pilots is being estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they "are gladiators not predictable."
HP will open in two years twenty own shops with local Vertreibern
Hewlett-Packard (HP) initiated yesterday his first excluding shop into collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes in Barcelona.
It is the first of a sale net consisting of twenty businesses with each 80 to 100 square meters which the Multi intends in the next two years in Spain to open.
The society agrees this initiative with the already existing 16 sale fields in the increase brand company, as for example PC town, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairperson of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned the rebuilt shop as an example at the grain Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, who HP cooperates with since thirty years.
The North American company group intends to 2010 in Europe to fit out 200 sales offices, of that 20 subsidiaries in Spain.
The first were initiated last week into Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the coming openings, it did not exclude, however, that Madrid could be the next objective.
The deputy chairperson, that also head of HP Personal is system's, assured the philosophy for the loading opening is always identical. It is based on a local Vertreiber with experience and knowledge of the trade.
The North American company group advises these and takes over the excluding loading equipment (with interactive products for the touching). In Europe all shops will look identical.
In addition HP is responsible for the training of the loading personnel.
Helena Herrero said, it is not a question of a franchising system and he emphasized that with the excluding sales office net is intended "the customer service and the consultation of Small- and Kleinstunternehmen during the purchase and after optimizing even the packagings."
The shop in Barcelona has an engineer pilot program which solves the technical problems of the HP-devices with guarantee.
An online service sets up a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way we can solve in ten minutes problems which use sometimes up to two days."
"This system became in particular for Small- and to Kleinstunternehmen as well as private customers develops, because the large-scale enterprises have already their service contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herroro declared yesterday."
Sabadell wants 'to steal' his rival in three years one millions of customers
The managerial board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers are. He believes that in 2001 a hard year will be for the banks, at first, however, a new liquidity crisis rejects and the end of the fault war prophesies.
In spite of that he foresees a burglary of the interest margins which the banks attempt to compensate for with rises of the fees and the prices for loans.
Sabadell expects, in three years one to catch millions of private customers - a compartment to still be withstood.
Sabadell found the way to empty the coming three years and to survive so in a very complicated economical environment.
The bank will introduce in 2011 a new Dreijahresleitplan.
The objective does only not say to survive without using the public aids from the FROB but in addition the share of the market about one millions of private customers - 700 000, if one removes the customers that the bank will lose - increase. That is the great challenge before which this bank stands, because until now she dedicated more attention to their business customers than their private customers.
This year she has to manage 250 000 private customers and 50 000 enterprises.
Your share of the market with private customers is near 3,5 percent while the business customers are forming more than 10 percent.
A further principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the rise of the productivity, speak Austerität, cost reduction. She will present the challenges which the bank in this way faces together with annual account report.
Only few banks dare in these difficult times of objectives to define and to publish since through the financial crisis all plans of the banks got messily worldwide.
Sabadell will finish this year their four years ago defined leading-plan Optima. This was initially laid out onto three years, but due to the market it was prolonged around a business year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main aim of the bank.
Guardiola accentuated at a breakfast organized by the APIE, in 2011 a "difficult" year "with great range" would become.
The manager starts from that, Spain would come only "slowly" out of the crisis.
In addition it would be "very difficult" to create Work in two or three years - basic for the survival of the banks.
Even if it goes out of the war around passives - that punishes the interest margins - fading, the loadings, the banks and savings banks for their emissions for the receipt of liquidity will have to pay, shifted as a compensation for profit margins fading away already onto those ones price for credits.
"The topics of liquidity and financing are more structurally kind and they will exert pressure on the credits."
"We did not wring the cock, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto distributed on Thursday already the order onto their branch net, to restrict the allocation of long-term loans and to increase the interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of the 22nd and 27th November).
The manager also admitted to increase the fees, however, the banks currently pursued the Stategie "within an embossed from the competition frame."
Sabadells leading-plan is based on an organic growth even if the group does not exclude corporate businesses, as always.
Not for nothing he assures that in Spain "greater enterprises are necessary."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
It stresses, that the need for capital at the time of "enormously climbs" and it does not exclude that some Spanish finance institutes will slip into red numbers.
He thinks the FROB can replace the money market at Kaptitalaufstockungen.
After he assuring that Sabadell can survive also a temporary closing of the markets, it invalidates the argument of some bankers who prophesy already a new liquidity crisis.
Stressed it one can not bring anything into circulation, however, unlike the incidents in June, one can achieve short-term financing above Repogeschäfte and catch the crisis in this way.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of the savings banks
The president of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility yesterday, that it can result in a fusion wave of the savings banks and stressed the quickness with which the branch is restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not insist on that at the first phase participate. You reserved yourself the second round.
On the other hand the president of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured this second round would not occur.
"I believe that the biggest part of the fusions is finished. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica can not be considered as a second round, it was a question rather of adaptations."
"The biggest part is finished. It can be, that we start of siebzehen thirteen or fourteen have, but all important processes are already accomplished. You were controlled by Banco de España, who supported all processes strongly."
At a breakfast organized by the association of the managers and managers of Aragoniens (ADEA) Olavarrieta exported, that the concentration process "as fast as possibly was carried out and that we must be satisfied with the period of time just course, that was defined in former times, not now," within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España," it stressed.
"The crossing of 45 savings banks with 28 000 million on the average property supply on 17 with each 75 500 million is a historically incomparable process. The number of the finance institutes was reduced by 62 percent and they are now very much much larger, with which we fulfilled the Baseler agreement," he emphasized.
Olavarrieta declared "there would be a series of unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, the Unserioesität and Unsinnigkeit" revealed, because "Banco de España warns us fristgerecht before end of the year close."
The president of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain of one of the most rigorous financing systems of Europe and "maybe" the whole world has and complemented that those ones, that that anzweifeltenn this "without deeper knowledge" would do.
The manager noticed that we "do not have to work" ourselves in the present economic economic situation "any worries" about the situation of the finance institutes and the savings banks that went through a concentration process "meaning very much" that "is carried out "as quickly as possibly.
It reminded also of that, that the Spanish banks the stress tests, that the EZB carried out in July, very good had existed.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin decided for the Beibehalt of the euro, but made conditions for the entire European Union simultaneously.
The tensions on the markets activated a double answer of the government.
On the one hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero presented new adaptation measures, begun with tax reductions for Small- and Kleinstunternehmen, the regulation of time work enterprises or the cancellation of the 426 euros of support for unemployed persons that do not get any unemployment pay, up to the denationalization of 49 percent of AENA, of the administration of the airports Barajas and El Prat as well as 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand the deputy head of the government, Elena Salgado, supports the criticism with the aid of the former government president Felipe González at the chancellor Angela Merkel as persons responsible, that the present crisis has sworn.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated, that Merkels is position no error of their public relations.
On the contrary, it is a question of a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro.
In this case Germany takes a basically new perspective for the organization of our future which collides with the maintaining of the traditional traditions of a majority of his partners.
Faced with the resistances in Europe one begins more than three possible ways out in Germany from the crisis too spekuliern.
The First: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries during which south would have to leave the euro room.
The Second: The Reintroduction of the German Marks - although that rings at the time of rather according to Science Fiction -, supports from a majority of the public opinion, approx. 50 percent of the population.
The third parties: A conversion of the euro according to German proposals. That means: more macroeconomic control; severe housekeeping; Penalization of the countries which infringe the handicaps; möglichereweise the failure of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adaptation measures onto the private sector.
The German position is unequivocal and emerges already for some time. Therefore there are not now any excuses.
First 2009, than both the IWF and the European commission created stimuli for deficits and a constitution reform pulled the German government out of the sleeve in order to prevent this from 2016.
That was the first sign for the drifting between the, what Germany held for necessary (severe tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of his European partners, including France.
The Central European country put the second sign when Merkel postponed the decision for the rescue of Greece painfully.
Then that was criticized strongly. But fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public one and the published opinion were absolute against a rescue of Greece.
Finally Merkel comes in the last October days again with an unequivocal position. It demands a reform of the descendants of the European Union in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and to engage the private lenders simultaneously to bear a part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, there they the Ireland crisis and following everything drove forward.
But their proposal, although something sweetens, was accepted. In the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union which is supposed to facilitate these measures from 2013.
Germany drew a red line which proposes not to cross it.
It says it to all of them that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken - there will not be the old mode of operation of the euro from this appointment anymore.
In 2013 the year of birth of a new currency room will be in which the contravening countries in a hard way are punished, can be forced to that to declare oneself in an insolvent way and in this case the private sector must take over a part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we must break a hard growth course with high saving and investment rates, moderation of the consumption, improvement of the productivity and competitive capacity as well as positive aussen-economical balances.
The other alternative that is based on indebtedness and building trade with gigantic holes in the balance of payments so as it was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will not be accepted simple.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly at not understanding it.
It is not a question only of driving the state deficit up to the year 2013 on three percent.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing which we could do under these conditions is to deceive us ourselves.
I hope for the present turbulences changing into more rest.
And that we will use the possibilities which are offered to us up to the spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood that also so, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the large-scale enterprises on the last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) refers to that, that in spite of the criticism at Merkel the hypothesis, to create order in the own house, their way has prepared.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like this that something would be changed at that.
Under the possibilities taken into account that one is that we would have to leave the euro room crammed with few serious countries not to exclude.
In This Case Germany could say still to us it warned us.
Sport and rule avoidance
Tricks as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, however not the will, to avoid a sanction.
The exclusion supposedly instigated by two players of the real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of the 23rd November against the Ajax in the champions League led to a lot of ink being spilled about that whether it around an unsporting action or not acted and whether possibly both players of the UEFA should be sanktioniert.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before time Playing (their team had won already unequivocal) and several fouls played so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will fulfill the stipulated sanction during the next league game against the Auxerre and get so into the next game phase without cards.
Finally the Disziplinarkommitee of the UEFA punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the shared players with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is to be found rather frequently in the world of the soccer.
You are so widespread, that she is a part of the Ethos - the rules unwritten, but followed in this event.
Part of the arisen debate around the represented case goes back, that a team of the soccer club played real Madrid (that sets noble-mindedness and honor in his hymn and had punished his players on other occasions for similar incidents) in this case the title role, and onto the dramatization through Mourinho that more added an episode to his long history as a theatrical and provoking technician.
That is in Any Case the debate turns around whether this behavior not forbidden expressly from the statutes contradicts the principles of the sport, whether these actions represent a rule avoidance. In fact this approach sticks to the statutes of the sport, to seem to avoid his sense, however.
With this matter the damage caused to the sport spirit should be examined.
The sport spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect which was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
A further aspect of a clean game consists in avoiding that the contravening players draw an unjustified benefit from the Gegenteam. Also that did not happen.
The paradoxical thing of the action of the players of the real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually mean by wrong game or rule avoidance, because the avoidance of the rule was not carried out secret in order to avoid a sanction but it should be as striking as possible so that she is punished by the referee.
The players waited and accepted the sanction gladly.
Another question is which kind from advantage the contravening ones drew from the deliberate fouls.
Here should be emphasized, that neither the rival was not brought into a more detrimental situation still advantages for the played game were demanded, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to play with less players.
It is not also a useful strategy for the next game, because the club is not in charge of these players then.
The advantage consists obviously, that the players begin the next game phase of the champions League without cards that their participation in a future game could threaten.
But it is a question of a long-term one, to advantage uncertain to a certain degree, since the team could also drop out sometime. In addition the players with this approach receive a sanction and change into the second card cycle in which they drop out because of card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle.
In this way it is not so clear whether it is really a question of an advantage.
Finally direct such approaches not against the sport spirit which also strategic decisions appertain to in order to draw a maximum benefit from the rules.
In This Case the players did not want to avoid any sanction (that would be in fact an unequivocal case of rule avoidance), they rather wanted to choose, when they subject themselves to this.
You made a strategic decision without evading a punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the border is blurred between inventiveness and rule surroundings, I believe that it deals itself with inventiveness with this matter around a clear case.
I have the impression that the polemic arose due to two factors: Because it was a question of two selfexclusions and because of the kind of the intentional rule transfer.
The damage that was added to the principles of the sport by these actions is less ethical as rather aesthetic kind.
Offer offensive for the touting for group Christmas Eve chimneys in Barcelona
This year makes the dictatorship of the calendar fall an avalanche of reservations onto the 16th and 17th days December.
The ones wide of celebrations paid to employees themselves from. You want to spend not more than 20 to 30 euros.
As the Turrón and the Christmas lottery there are in the consecrating night time group suppers which provide the restaurant and leisure time trade of Barcelona with oxygen also again. But due to the depression they activate a price offensive in order to catch also the customer segment which represents the big mass: They almost all would like to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a noon or evening food, confirm the consulted entrepreneurs and associations.
In this way the accountancy still a little complicated becomes, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) made all orders fall into the week of the 13th December, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of suppers onto two Spitzentager (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders weekdays in front of that.
Since 2008, than the bad times began, many enterprises stopped the group suppers for budget reasons.
In order not to have to renounce this tradition, many employees pay these from their own bag.
How the economic situation is ever, Niedrigstpreise are demanded, confirms the chairperson of the restaurant committee of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the roof truss does not dare until now to predict how the holidays will look in this month.
"The people consider it 'zig time, before they reserve."
"You would like to go out gladly, but they pay attention to the prices strongly," it stresses.
The business will go at those "that offer quality to good prices with a good service" well he adds, and calls us into the memory, that the customers save in times of crisis, for which prices about 25 euros most strongly ask about.
With an inquiry in various centrally sited restaurants it turns out that the evening of the 17th December leads the providers to the collapse.
The group of Soteras says, the demands for this Friday with the intention to spend less than 30 euros would become boomen. The group fit their menus with complete offers to between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana who maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others) the particularity of the calendar led to preferred reservations, even from beginning of November.
"We made the impossible thing possible in order to maintain the previous year prices with menus for every taste of 19,95 to 30 euros," it declares.
At AT Grup that guides El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and in total 23 restaurants one does not lose the optimism, after since the second quarter the gains flourish again and good, although onto few days of concentrated prospects for the Christmas business is expected.
Sources of the company group emphasize that also the 18th will be a hyperactive day with friend groups which celebrate Christmas.
A Christmas menu was added to the six group menus for 30 euros or more than price hit. One has to spend 10 percent more the impression that the customers are ready than in the previous year and to want more details in the corresponding train, as for example Cava.
Also in some companies one sees green rungs sprouting, for which the employees are invited again. That provides the impression that the group chimneys are again in the upswing.
Vonseiten of the roof truss Fecasarm (with alliances as the pub, restaurant and leisure time association of Barcelona), familiarly the deputy chairperson, Enric Gomà, to see the end of the tunnel on that and notices that the reservations are quite in total "lively" although the customers gain a maximum.
The fun at the celebrating regardless who pays did not go back, however.
The Pakistan nuclear program arouses great concern in the USA
Islamabad makes nuclear weapons "faster than any other country.
Disclosures of Wikileaks confirm relationships between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the North American message in Pakistan and the US state department revealed from the internet portal Wikileaks confirm which enormous worries the Pakistan atomic program Washington prepares.
On the fringe of the clearing and juicy details that offer the documents about the contents of the conversations and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad these reveal that the cooperation between both countries is not intensified as regards atomic security, but on the contrary it "decreases" and that the unstable Asiatic country manufactures more atomic arms "to a faster Rhytmus than any other country."
In particular the characteristic of the Pakistan atomic program - that the arms are not put together, but to be stored their components in order to complicate their destruction at a possible attack - sleepless nights prepare Washington.
The ambassadress counts following risks in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report in front of the visit of the former conductor of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some atomic installations to the field attacked by the Taliban, the presumable spreading of the nuclear material and the delicateness of the transportation of nuclear material."
The great person number, that are implied into the nuclear arsenals and the missile programs, not more only of the USA becomes, but also of Russia than escalating and noticed about Grund to make caution prevail.
"Pakistan must employ severe faithful personnel for the guard of the atomic installations; due to the low one Education- and cultural levels have extremist organizations more possibilities persons that cooperate in atomic or missile programs, too reklutieren," the expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Department of State said in a discussion with his North American colleagues."
Again at the documentation revealed to Internetportal by Julian Assanges is, that the cooperation between the USA and Pakistan as regards nuclear circulation decreases and increased that speed, in the Pakistan nuclear arms makes.
In May is declared from an office of the message that describes the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating": "Frequently there is not any transparency; onto auxiliary offers we keep no answers or they are refused."
In another communication Peter Lavoy, official of the state secret service for South Asia, confirms that "in spite of the economical disaster Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly produces as no other country."
The ambassadress Patterson asks Washington during a visit of the uppermost army conductor, general Ashfaq Kayani, the person responsible "to explain" that "Pakistan's army has to stop his silent Überstützung of terrorist groups."
On the hunt according to Wikileaks head
Obama appoints a high person responsible the prevention of new disclosures for the antiterrorism fight.
Interpol gives a red warning to the pursuit and finding from Assange.
All which is associated with Wikileaks and his founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts in an only difficult way can be cleared up.
Yesterday Interpol gave a "red warning" to the "finding and pursuit" of Assange from.
However, it is not a question in this case of a traditional order for the arrest.
In addition it is not new, it comes from the 20th November.
She does not have to put also anything with the last disclosure from more than four million diplomatic documents from the USA, but with the accusations of sexual abuse which the Australian must be confronted with in Sweden.
Further the attorney of the founder of Wikileaks, mark of Stephens, assures "the police would know where and how it can contact Mr Assange."
Already at the 20th the international police with seat distributed the order in Lyons (France) on request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday according to receipt to the authority through the Swedish authorities.
The things are like this. The 188 Interpol countries are dependent, to identify Assange and to discover "in order to arrest him temporarily and to hand over."
Although Interpol can not order the arrest of one of individual affected by a red warning, many member countries consider according to statements of the organization the red warning as a charter in particular for an Arrestierung - that must be carried out by the national police - if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, where Assange presumably stays, as it is the case of Sweden and England.
The procedure indignant Assanges attorneys, the gesten ones a letter published, in which they informed of the 39-year old founder of Wikileaks being ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
You also remind of Assange applying for the departure from Sweden and obtaining the corresponding permission from the state attorney that is compared with the sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief safety officer of Stalin.
"That is as a hunt, not as a legal pursuit," is accused in the writing.
While the world is searching it - and declared his mother by Australia the innocence of their Sohns - Assange stays at an unknown place, however not keeping quiet.
On Monday it gave an interview to the conductor of the magazine Time by Skype from an indefinite place. At the conversation he applied for the resignation of the state secretary of the USA, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to ausspionieren the UNO and so that against international agreements signed by the USA offended, she would have "to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who referred to the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not sure, why we should put value onto the opinion of a type with a web site," it declared to the CNN sender.
Obama himself charged a high person responsible the prevention of new document disclosures for the antiterrorism fight, Rusell Travers.
The attempt of the speaker of the Präsidenden Barack Obama to give Assange less attention conflicts too the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators in these days announce.
To examine the congress representative Peter King that will chair from January in the Nationalen Sicherheitskommitee of the parliament, the state department asked, the possibility to put Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "in order to confiscate their money and everyone, that supports her or achieves a contribution pursue."
Tom Flanagan, consultant of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, had gone even wider, and it must his statement Assange must revoke "to be murdered."
"Obama would have to change it into a target and use a not manned airplane or something like that."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible premiership candidate.
"Whoever it was, that made in the government information seep, it is the betrayal guilty and everything what no execution is, eiine too mild punishment is," it declared to the sender fox terrier.
Puigcercós searches the Carod too with a wink peace Being Close in the ERC
The republican leader allows the party a secret vote about his living on in the office.
Huguet suggests a more pluralistic government and the end of the plenary session principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a prescription, around for the zigsten time one internal riot to avoid in the rows of the ERC direction-free to the loss of 11 representatives and half of the votes.
The party chairperson is conscious that his resignation threat does not suffice to those being close of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as weakened as their mentor himself and will not bring him the same head fragmentation as other former currents do.
Therefore the leader of Esquerra attempts with a wink to win the new critics, which would safeguard his position up to the next local choices.
For the beginning told yesterday at, that the more than 200 regional councilors of ERC could comment on his remaining secretly in the office.
With choice notes, not with higher hand.
If the Carodisten wanted to give a ticket to the Präsidenen, they could do this without having to fear reprisals.
In fact the head would like to avoid both the impression of split and that of subjection under his person.
It strengthened in several interviews, it would not be confirmed with half of the voices plus one feel, and he added without specification of percentages a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod Nahestehenden demand more from the president than to provide his office only for the party. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the uppermost organ of the congresses.
But since they are not in charge of a sufficient majority for the promotion from resignations, they will agree a procedure plan of now until May with the executive board.
For that they expect, at the preparation of the document about strategic reorientation, that the management will present to the council to be able to participate for the vote at the 18th.
It is your intention to vouch for Puigcercós. In the corresponding train this is supposed to promise, the congress to bring forward into the fall 2011, which the party top already holds for a fact.
The party chairperson of the ERC thinks, the "polyphony" damages the stability and he strives once and for all for washing their dirty laundry behind closed doors to bring the organization into the situation.
In this sense the article which the current Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Faced with the one that Puigcercós is an ideologist the holder of Innovació held it for a fact that the party chairperson is supported "in the exchange against different objectives."
He counted five from which two stand to the fore.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the executive board, in this way these at least 90 percent's of the party members represents, that is called the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment.
The Second could be the great piece of news.
Huguet suggests, ERC is supposed to give up the plenary session principle at last as a mode of operation.
In this way it defend a reform of the statutes, to keep off that is supposed to facilitate it the congresses with elected delegatees.
From the termination of the plenary session model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós is 'Team that fought for that already on the last two congresses obsessively.
In fact the party leadership was charged the inspection of the plenary session principle on the trembling meeting by 2008 on a congress which should deal with the reformation of the statutes.
This appointment is pending still, there infogle the internal Aufruhe of the last years the starting of this matter not advisable was.
Now, without which critical sectors are on the lookout, the time could have come in order to pick up this matter again and to finish forever.
23 murdered ones in November, 290 in the year 2010
According to the counting of MILENIO four cases were noted in México in less than 2010.
In November 23 persons were murdered in México, according to the countings of MILENIO México that are four less than in the Vormonat.
Among the murdered ones three women and the find of two amputated bodies in the valley of Mexico are to be emphasized.

Obama supports the law in Twitter for the benefit of undocumented students
"When you for the discharge of the Dream Act - law's are, call your senators then and insist on the discharge of this law," twitterte" the president of the United States in the popular social net."
The president Barack Obama supported today the national mobilization to the support of the Dream Act - law's for the legalization of undocumented students with an information on his personal blog in the social net Twitter.
"When you for the discharge of the Dream Act - law's are, call your senators then and insist on the discharge of this law," twitterte Obama."
His short communication contains a Cyberlink for a more extensive document which asks the public to get with their senators into contact unterzüglich since the vote of the law approaches immediately.
"With your voice which we wait for the time came, to listen to you," it stresses.
The information was spread after the 42 republican senators threatened all voice to jam for every law, except for the expansion of the tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be expanded.
Such a blockade that was announced on a letter signed by the 42 republican senators could onto the vote of the Dream Act - law's and other projects as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the circulation of nuclear weapons affect.
Questioned about the blockade of the republicans of the law of Dream Act and other projects, the premiership speaker Robert Gibbs said he trusts in a schedule being able to be made if the tax topic is once solved for the remaining projects.
"I believe, we have still a lot of time..."
"All we agree, that the tax matter must be run before end of the year..."
"I believe, that we can reach an agreement about that at any time and after that we can "plan" the course of the rest," he said.
The chairperson of the democratic majority in the senate, Harry Reid, told on Tuesday at, "he would become the vote on end of the debate" propose, in this way the Dream Act - law with which the initiative for the legalization of undocumented students can be synchronized from the coming Thursday in the senate although the next week would be more probable.
The version of the Dream Act - law's and/or. the law of the American Dream would have lived about 800 000 young people that immigrated to the United States when they were not yet any sixteen years old during the last ones five years in this country and written at a higher educational facility or near the army are, legalize.
But the advocates of the law need sixty voices, for which they are dependent to republican onto the voices of a handful, for the discharge of the initiative. At this time the organizations of the intercessors of this project organize an intense influence on the discharge of the law.
The democrats, of which to support the majority the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, the senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska said, he would vote against that and only a republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
Therefore the defenders of the Dream Acts must get several republicans onto their page if other democrats should decide to turn the back to the initiative.
Those ones belong to the the most umworbenen republicans from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the senator George Lemieux from Florida that took over the mandate of the senator Mel Martínez.
Further republicans that supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared not to support it more in another occasion.
A further republican who had spoken out for the law, John McCain, did not define his attitude up to now yet.
Although the House of Representatives has another version, the analysts agree on that, which the Dream Act stands in the senate before the greatest obstacles.
Putting the finger into the wound with literature
The second round of 'the' a walk in the case of which the participants made themselves strong for the story was 'pleasure in the language'
"I understand that with the sex in the language, however... The finger in the wound? What is "expected" by me"? the writer Luisa Valenzüla asked that should open the second round of 'Lot placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and used the subtitle of their question on this occasion (on another event the Round Table was dedicated to the sex in the language, it declared).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," the Argentine Schriftstellein spat sweetly towards the public, which mainly consisted of young people that came together on the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) which Valenzüla, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated in in order to attend to rounds moderated to this by Marisol Shultz table.
Luisa Valenzüla read out a text which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz characterized as a splendid story after that. Luisa tells in first person and is the protagonist that on the search it is to find out what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from which she receives indeed no answer, but tips for the guide of their story.
She leaves the Infektologen convincedly: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that is my wound."
To the end, after a frustrating approximation to the traumatologist that robbed her of the breath right on the walk, and that declares her, however, that Wunde is not a scientific concept enthült the psychoanalyst the secret: "the wound is the really Open one, the symbolic thing is the scar."
The central figure of the story sighs facilitatedly and closes, that they "of the wound only found out that this is really open and does not "exist." But it is convinced, that the pleasure in the language and their traps mix.
Valenzüla, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez introduced also a delighting story that he mentioned 'Praise of the invention', and that does not mention in that of the fingers in the wound indeed, but that is discovered.
With allusions onto the magic realism it tells about a famous magician that touched the clouds, returned far traveled men or reconstructed the virtue lost by a girl. The story did an about-turn and reported about America, the great novel that from the beginning did not lack his own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo that criticizes the abundance of the histories told by the Eroberen.
"Cervantes that invited us all (the writers) mocked the deceived witnesses that emerged in the histories represented as true, however, in another manner the history of Americas would never have been told - with fancy that lost even the shame."
However, he emphasizes, "it is the madmen and liar, that imagine the things best," and there reality and lie, where one does not know to which page the story belongs anymore, where the fictitious literature reaches the peak, approximate to each other.
He mentions that the 'tradition Cervantes' in fact.
"We inherited from him, to be what is told."
When it was up to Mayra Montero, she commented and the writer praised the variety of the interpretations which the FIl had contributed the invitation to to the Round table 'The finger in the wound'.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican dedicated their contribution of the large wound of the social power that strikes their country - as whole Latin America - as a result of the fights for the drug traffic.
"I believe, that to contain good literature, good poetry, good songs" a silent, deliberately not planned engagement," she declared, after she had emphasized that literature is communication and obligation that builds themselves "up" between the author and the readers as at a "chemical re-action."
The Spanish poet Luis García Montero concluded the evening, whose contribution also this finger of the engaged writer in the wound of the writer hevorhob.
He noticed that in a short-lived world also the intellectual habits and the control of the consciousness come to dogmatisms, and will forget "that behind every confirmation a small refusal stands and behind every denial a small yes."
"Around in the possession our thought and the reality be, we must nuance: And nuancing means frequent, to put the finger into the wound and to bother those ones that feel a lot of wohler if they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in preassembled ideas without nuances, and to bother also the powerful ones that prefer it, to divide the world into black and white it noticed and invited to rediscovering the sense of the writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back upon three defeats in finals, he has on the and Abs in his career experiences, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey during the final two styles different, set by their respective coaches in addition face, and of this meeting characterized from contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back upon three defeats in finals, he has on the and Abs in his career experiences, but three times he had decisive games, and up to now it held itself well, for which this occasion of very special importance for it is.
The Argentine blew up with the medal to the second champion, he fell behind the winners a step and strange to say he delivered with the same team consecutive finals.
The santistische strategist achieved the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia with which he found out a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2 had the reins in the hand; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' it achieved the decisive duel that he lost to Rayados also with 3-1.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' at which they played against Los Diablos Rubén had to put in a setback again since the game with 2-2 ended undecidedly against Los Choriceros after 210 game minutes, however, during the penalty it got on with 3-1 and got two possibilities to put in his title, however, ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to one 4-3.
Rubén had lost already two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his tall rival. Therefore he would not like yet to be followed once from the misfortune and to free from the bad charm in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time although he confirms that for it the most important thing is the game itself.
The helmsman commented, "I would like to become champion, I would not like to break any statistics, that is for a club, for my affection which I devote myself to, and therefore the title to me will come, but what happens before, is the most important thing," when one questions it about the lost finals.
He had the last final still strongly in the memory, he assures to have learned a lot from that: "The only lesson that we can draw from that is, that until the referee does not whistle the end, we can not celebrate, we are not at the line prepared, the players also, because we were already the last time with two penalties it prepares for that to drop out, and I believe that that is a lesson until the game is not ended, there is not any reason to the celebrating."
Knowing that this series could be decided on by penalty-firing does not worry him, because he trusts in his players: "One never during the penalty-firing wants to arrive, one would like to close in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is not any alternative and one must be prepared for that, above tour were we prepares, however unfortunately the fate prepared a bad game for us, sometimes due to nervousness or the vehement aim to hold the title already in the hands that left something to us for this final, and we hope for its not resulting in that this time."
It suits in Romanso Macht not to be only a second champion anymore and to taste the fame that the titles with themselves bring for the first time.
The USA changes the rules for the receipt of a visa
The persons must introduce themselves before their conversation near the consulate near the service places for the visa ordering; Costs will become waiting times so reduced.
From the 10th January 2011 the procedures for the ordering of a visa are changed in the message of the United States and in the consulates.
With the new procedure most proposers must introduce themselves before their conversation in the consulate near the service places for the visa ordering (ASC, the first letters in English).
The personnel of the ASC incorporate the biometrical data of the proposer which are checked by the consulate before the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, number among that:
The total costs for the handling of the visa sink, because it is not more necessarily the appointment agreement to pay the processing of the visa request and the transport services with which the document is given separately.
The proposer achieves only a single payment which covers the three services.
The present price remains unchanged: the Gegenwerit to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with request (including visas for time workers) and 390 dollars for Händer and investors.
Those ones which would only like to extend their visa do not have to lead any conversation in the consulate, they must introduce themselves only at the nearest ASC where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometrical data are obtained in the ASC, the proposers who need a second appointment for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than formerly.
Those ones who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nüvo Laredo do not have to pay the service impact of 26 dollars anymore.

14 supposed drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday Estrie were carried out within the framework of the suppression of a production and sale net of cannabis around the ten house searches in the administration region.
Fourteen persons were arrested in this case and will be set opposite different accusations.
The house searches happened in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, to be supposed to have served at the places that one mainly the drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that the production was used for were confiscated," gave Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker of the security police of Quebec.
In total eleven men and three women from whom two of the men who are regarded as main wire-pullers of the drug ring come from Sherbrooke were arrested.
The arrested persons are supposed to have appeared already to their arrest before the court house according to hours in Sherbrooke.
You could among other things the accusation of the production of cannabis, whose Besitze to sale purposes, to be accused of the plot as well as the service of crimes.
These house searches had occurred in consequence of a laborious investigation activity which went for more than a year ahead.
"The information obtained from public authority made to carry out these arrests for us possible," specified M. Ruel.
Around the 70 policemen of the regional investigation unit of Estrien of the security police of the Quebec, the police service Sherbrooke as well as the police Memphrémagog had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be pursued without problems
The draft of the conservative that is supposed to control the problem of the ships loaded with secret immigrants according to the government pulls down all foresight after after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they can not approve the proposal.
"I revolt with emphasis against this charter."
"I hold with a party which put you fetters onto the feet," declared Michael Ignatieff, head of the liberals, after the weekly Caucus-meeting in front of the gathered representatives.
The liberals claimed, the draft that allows everyone of one than identified by illegal immigrants to the transportation to hold sea-going vessel coming person up to a year, the Canadian right and freedom constitution hurts so as suggestedly.
It pointed out to Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, in the same way not to be able to support the draft since it opposes the wrong target group.
"On the other hand we are and it seems that all opposition parties on the other hand are therefore we become" M. Duceppe declared "to wait, which the government undertakes."
The criticism with regard to the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, expelled the critics from the hand that demand their party would not behave steadfastly enough opposite the secret immigrants.
"We are the neo-democrats so that understood that one takes measures against the stowaways, and now this attempt through mediation of another draft, the C-35, put through," Chow mentioned.
We do not approve the draft of the conservatives therefore because he searches the fault with the refugees and "detains children" for at least a year," declared Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties, to play with the politics and to ignore the will the Canadian.
"The Canadians inform the representatives insistently that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration these criminal processes that affect Canada and that treat the country as a foot doormat."
"You expect the reaction so that Canada takes hard measures" minister Kenneys.
"The government did not announce any vote of confidence concerning their draft which could have led the country to choices which would have refused the government.
A conservative expressed, however, opposite the agency QMI, the government would call a vote so that every opposing representative declares himself immediately opposite his voters.
The new unit does not find any unanimity
In spite of the announcement of the possible foundation of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest numerous observers keep on demanding the education of a public investigation committee on this topic.
Robert Dutil, minister of the public security, claims, this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted already last January the New Yorker Department of Investigation concerning this topic.
The metropolis is in charge of a standing unit since 1870 against the corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday surprised more than only one.
One must say with regard to that that this measure was in the least not discussed on the occasion of the meeting of the constant committee of the Quebecer police service on 29th October last year in spite of the presence Robert Dutils.
It was not missing either, that this announcement as regards "rakes" Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, public security as "a rabbit conjured out of the hat" as well as "at a table end made solution" qualified.
Minister Dutil had turned for his part in turn to those ones who fear that the political power has too much influence on the unit standing into consideration, future.
"You will see the result if we will announce it" he was satisfied confirm.
"One is conscious of this problem to oneself."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the realization of a public inquiry.
"Per more M. Charest on wanting to prevent the education of this investigation committee persists the more the people become as she and I think that he has to hide something" declared it.
"The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the resignation of Jean Charest," so Yves Boisvert declared for his part, university lecturer for ethic and political systems at the ENA (staatl. College for the training of high administration officials).
In order to come out of this dead end, he suggests to the Quebec to grant a specific mandate to the finance examination control in this way this enquiries corresponding about corruption and secret agreements can start.
"One should be capable to expand the mandate of the examination control," so he decided.
He represents in the same way the opinion that the Quebec of the examination control could grant the same power as superintendents which would allow her also to oblige the people to the statement.
The education of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest.
The Quebec will demand from Ottawa in the same way to change the criminal law in such a way in order to be employed better in this way of crimes.
This demand comes from the senior public prosecutor of the operation Marteau that informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier of the jurisdiction not being unequivocal in this kind of the prosecution.
Vic Töws, Minister of State for public security confirmed for his part, his colleague of the justice, Rob Nicholson, sits down at the time of with amendments certain, affecting this dossier from each other.
During the operation Printemps 2001 that affected the groups of the motorcycle policemen 131 persons had been arrested, although the criminal law not novelliert was.
Ottawa put through the law due to that against Gangstertum.
Rivers under severe supervision
Several courses keep on staying under severe guard due to the high fallouts that have poured since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
Into Shawinigan, in the administration region Mauricie, it came in the Wednesday afternoon for a landslide.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
At the evening a further landslide happened in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administration region Lanaudiere.
A street zusammengesunken in this case in itself.
Of Tuesday on Wednesday evening strong rainfalls of 40 poured themselves up to 70 milliliters fallout onto several regions.
Between 20 to 40 more millimeters fallout were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The fields north of the river as well as the valley of the region Outaouais were most strongly affected.
Here up to in total 100 millimeters of rain showers had come down.
Since still the snow fusion which already accumulated itself in certain subareas is to be added to these fallouts, the overflowing of several watercourses is feared.
At the Wednesday evening were called out from the Quebecer security service concerning warnings about the high tide alarm the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the region Lanaudiere.
The courses in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentinischen Bergen and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of the high tide supervision here and stay also furthermore under observation.
In the region Lanaudière the vehement fallouts involved the overflowing of some lakes in Sainte Julienne Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte an avoiding-bridge was torn away due to the strong rainfalls.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais the overflowing of certain lakes has the closing of several streets, in particular in the Mansfield-et-Pontefract municipality causes.
The security service keeps on remaining in alert and controls the situation exactly, according to security counselor Annik Bouchard.
The Quebecer country high tide center handed over Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, for his part on Wednesday.
Dupont partially zurechtgewiesen
The Quebecer radio presenter Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback just the same before the Canadian supervisory board for radio norms (CCNR) because of his controversial comments above social welfare and Haitian as because of his aggressive speech manner above radio.
FM team represents the opinion, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 to the CCNR indeed the right to own opinion comment would have, however, certain comments would have "inaccurate information about the social welfare and without authorization negative representations of the Haitians as well as also a so rough speech manner that is not measured to the during the day broadcast broadcastings for contain."
The supervisory board had also end-deduced that a discussion about suicide that contains the circulation of the names of two persons that committed suicide offends against the codex of the radio broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments done during the broadcastings broadcast by 2008 and 2010 in the period.
The first decree was inserted "commun" due to a complaint of the "front the personnes assistées sociales you Québec."
The activist organization had complained, that the amounts mentioned in the broadcasting are inaccurate.
The presenters should give information rather sound than misleading.
With regard to presenter Stéphane Dupont had represented the opinion to the topic's suicide, the suicide is an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the supervisory board members had drawn the conclusion, the provided message is at that that suicide must not be regarded as solution of life crises.
"The majority of the supervisory board considers that the consequences of the broadcasting "Dupont le midi" standing into consideration would have touched a sensitive topic in family-oriented and suitable kind and manner."
Therefore it was not reserved with any reproach opposite his person.
The last quarrel point affected the statements that had referred to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given a media-effective quarrel conversation concerning that, that an amount of reactions caused.
The CHOI-presenter had declared not to have donated for the benefit of the Haiti-help since one would not know with security whether the needy also really received the money donations.
The supervisory board thinks that these comments of character not improper were, that, however, their cumulative effect presents a without authorization negative representation of the Haitians.
"I atoned for already my three day long suspension punishment in this thing."
"My file is since one years virgin," the presenter declared.
In all decisions the supervisory board denounces the circulation of a rough diction.
In all cases the CHOI-FM radio announcer acted "beyond his obligations."
The consequences for the radio station which had been supposed to inform of his decisions among other things uniquely during the prime time within a period of time of three days are insignificant.
A king of the Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealer of Algerian origin, broke a very special course.
The athlete who is brilliant in "Sanda" (Full contact Kung-Fu), in the kick boxing as well as in the Thai boxing climbs now onto the Tatami and into the boxing rings of the world in the search for new challenges.
"I began with combat events as Kung-Fu and kick boxes 12 years ago in Algeria," declared Zemmal which is resident since 2008 in the metropolis in order to develop among the pros.
I personally search the fight allerorten, since for those ones that do not like the on-the-ground wrestling as the mixed combat arts present it competitions are rare in North America."
Recently that of his sign had worked as a security guard as well as done in the company UPS his rival bad news gives, in which it achieved during the world championship of the amateurs delivered between the 23rd and 30th October in Edinburgh, Scotland, two gold medals of the World carats as well as the Kickboxing Association (WKA).
"I achieved the victory in the categories of the full contact kick boxing and the Thai boxing," it declared.
"At the time of I prepare me onto the world cup in the San Shou in China in front of."
"The fighters from every category who had positioned themselves during the last world championship under the first four had been invited."
"I gotten to babe 2009 into Toronto bronze."
"In 2005 I became Achter in Vietnam."
"In 2007 I ended the tournament in China on the fifth place while I was becoming third parties in 2009 in Toronto," he added.
It is erwähnenswert that I did progress at every competition."
"With this rhythm I will become this time or in the next year First"!
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines coming from China with which punches and kicks are permissible just the same as ground throws.
The duels are played usually on a platform, rarer in a boxing ring from.
The most renowned box fighter to follow from this kind of the combat port is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le who is presumably known in the world of the combat arts.
Nacer Zemmal should keep only a single event back in his career, he would call his presence like this here with security during the super-tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the rank-highest and" most "looked" in China," declared the agreeable great bloke.
"It is a little as the equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee (the biggest stadium of Thailand)."
"That was a super-experience."
Zemmal had gained his first fight in the semifinal of his category (80 kg) before he lost then in the final.
"The one that conquered me was a real pro," so it analyzed.
"There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals stumble in each case on each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of every category offer the forehead in order to crown an only champion the king of the Kung-Fu."
450 million in contracts without announcement
Hydro-Québec granted on friendly terms project engineering companies 450 millions dollar at contracts for the waterpower project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
Right in this avalanche of more than 100 contracts a consortium stands, existing from the Skilled BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that received the most important part, that is the one of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without announcement.
This consortium, mentionedly "Énergie gérance," überantworten this important, hydroelectric project to the private sector in 2004 as a concomitant of the decision of Hydro-Québec their responsibility at the level of a sum of 5 billion dollars, educated.
At the beginning of 2005 the consortium "Énergie gérance" got the lucrative contract without there having been a public announcement.
For the Parti Québécois the going back represents on enterprise consortiums a serious ethical problem which causes the risk of the Wettbewerbsverdrändung as well as a price increase.
"This is a new kind and manner of a fixed game and invalidates the competition."
"That means, that" one instead of fixed games instead of in secret way now in open form carries on," Sylvain Simard, representative of the PQ, declared yesterday, on the press conference.
On the early morning Simard had raised the question before the national assembly, because it seems hardly understandable to him as the interest of the public can be operated in this way.
Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon to that when she vehement denied that it would have been a question of a fixed game with this contract.
"I remain loyal to my line," she cursed in her confirming, the PQ went on "dishonest" and "it lacks hardness."
She said "it is the least thing" that the PQ apologizes.
The model of the consortium is worldwide usual practice.
It is a question usually of a within a given time so limited alliance that allows two or several enterprises to bundle up their expert opinions with regard to a commandment onto an announcement for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" shows a high complexity level concerning his work extent.
The construction method is in process and is supposed to be made to 2012.
Nevertheless the contract was assigned without a competition having been able to occur; there had been already negotiations.
Furthermore the model of the consortium does not represent an exception by any means anymore in the Quebec even with relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted down last week, object of government investigations is the model of the consortium used in the field of the civil engineer and consultation being.
A short flying of the Quebecer enterprise register allows it, to designate more than 200 consortiums, from those ones to be some of continuous duration to seem.
In this way the company Dessau cooperates for example with the majority of their nuclear competitors which CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult number among in partnership.
Any linking, and from that there is several dozen, leads back to the very same juridical person, indeed on Dessau.
Concerned something the consortium "Énergie gérance," minister Normandeau stressed so, that "the territory of the Baie James is subjected to a special worker dynamics and that Hydro-Québec expresses bill to this fact since the seventies in special kind and manner."
Réal Laporte, the tall employer of the Société d'énergie de la of Baie James (SEBJ), gave a declaration, that the nose made about the fact that the contract was granted about the project management according to accord turn up.
"When you do an announcement and gives it only few applicants, your prices will shoot up."
"You have therefore two possibilities: either you take the people, which are on this Mart and say to you: one will negotiate a satisfactory accord for a good price."
"The thought is, however, that the price is not decisive but the expertise of the persons," confirmed Laporte.
This contract granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts over more than 50,000 of the Parti Québécois preserved dollar.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After inspection the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineer and consultant contracts, the companies or their branches, under that in particular resource labs, between 2002 and were granted March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had gathered 22 contracts onto himself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without including their participation in "Énergie gérance" at that.
All these contracts were negotiated.
They amount in the Gesamt to 449 783 344 $, locked up in that the contract with "Énergie gérance" above 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain Simard had made be announced, that the four companies, who form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) the "Parti libéral you presumably confessed to Québec" are.
Minister Normandeau had made remember, the PQ is equally united with the companies that "financed" it before she specified that it is rather a question of their managers.
Barometer of verantworungsbewussten consumption - The "green" label is not confidence-raising
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence in the main protagonists of the lasting growth, however, in the same way little for the labeled brands or the eco-markings which are supposed to control his choice.
Damage although it swims in a media-effective universe, where it teems from information for the benefit of a more responsible consumption only so: the barometer of responsible consumption has to lament a lack of credible information, an inadequacy showed that looks recognizable as a brake of his engagement as the first reading that yesterday was kept off.
Although they drove forward the consumption of the so called socially compatible products in the year 2010, nevertheless the Quebecer seem to express credit little to those ones which these attempt to sell.
Two thirds the Quebecer population admits to give little belief to the environmental engagement of the companies just the same in fact as to the green enterprise advertising so the instrument worked out from the responsible consumer center of the university Sherbrooke betrays.
Another discovery: half of the consumers doubts about the trustworthiness of the certificates official, added to the supposedly fair products, but also the plausibility of the products and brands which declare themselves as ecology-minded, so the barometer.
To same pattern the discourse of the politicians is taken on this topic only by 14,6% of the Quebecer of population seriously.
The information with regard to responsible consumption shines nevertheless importantly for the stimulation of this consumption segment which is stimulated in approximately only a third's of the Quebecer consumers times.
In Fact emptiness and doubtful character of the information subdued the eagerness of 46% of the consumers.
This is the second according to the higher price of the products, on the part of the barometer brake identified.
In addition a third of the Quebecer of the indicated efficiency of the green products and services that one is bothered to them to put onto the hand stands mistrustfully opposite.
According to another communication over half of the consumers their habits had already changed in the year 2010 and changed mainly the brand of a or several products in order to give Ausdruck to their conviction.
According to barometer they had favored also to 61% of purchases with traders of their quarter and favored the purchase of food built on in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of the ecology-minded consumption had reached this year one 64 of the maximum value of 100 - the homo consumus the Quebec's loves it, to present oneself as a king of the recycling that attempts to reduce his tracks left behind in the environment in his seeing to the animal protection.
Nevertheless the social and ecological consciousness seems nevertheless to stop for his car, so the barometer: just once 28% of the Quebecer declared to have used 2010 public means of transportation in the year or to have preferred the going-headquarters in order to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Were approved also by 39,1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavior inquiry that feeds the stereotyped ideas the resting-walking as well as the bike driving.
State loan for the takeover of eXcentris
The Quebecer government that was asked to participate in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris financially by the Société Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle declares itself with a cooperation understood, however, only in shape a competitive loan.
The developer society Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle that eXcentris had hoped for a donation of cinema complex belonging from the Ministry of Education at the level of seven million dollars for the takeover of the Daniel Langlois on the boulevard Saint-Laurent around this again his actual cineastischen function überantworten, do not receive apparently, which they demanded.
The government accepted indeed to involve oneself, however, in this thing for their own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation offers the Quebecer government rather a loan in smaller than the height initially hoped for that could start up a viable solution to useful conditions at least in opinion of the sources entnehmbaren from the state rumor kitchen.
A first plan as well as an inquiry for 12,8 million were rejected already last spring by the Quebec, the petition was corrected since that renewed sum-moderately down.
Was sent already onto minister St-Pierre that leads the acts eXcentris a proposal together with a plan from the president of the "Société de développement of the entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola.
Several days ago he had made a last feature be attributed their.
The counterproposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, however, on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus answered now this up to the 31st December.
Anyway the premise of the state donation seems to really have been pushed to the page.
We call ourselves into memory, that the Quebecer owner community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had revolted against a direct state investment to the support of the takeover of eXcentris when she put forward the argument, the cult minister does not have to give any financial help for immovable projects there, that it has been able to receive cinema halls not also other.
Several other market participants of the segment demanded, however, in contrast substantial, economical help.
Cinema leader Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema to the construction of the cinema in an own way financed for more than ten years under great difficulties in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception position on the part of the treasury.
The lack of cinema halls which show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to hold his clientele near the pole.
The Société Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top of, head for her part for a privately financed Campagne, of which they a sum 700 000 $ to hope in order to stimulate the acquisition.
Since the spring 2009 only a single canvas leaves with showing films in eXcentris Le Parallèle indeed.
Objective of the future acquirers is it, the three cinema halls at the 27 February of next year with the demonstration of the very succeeded film of Xavier Beauvois Of "the hommes et the dieux" to open again.
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not recall the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what it and his group of the down corrected proposals which one made them hold.
Secret of the in a complex way joggled Canada ventilated
The new, American diplomat lines that were spread by WikiLeaks ventilate the secret about what the United Nations judge under the inferiority complex of the Canadians opposite the Americans; they lay, however, the superiority feeling with the same stroke last-named open opposite Canada.
Subsequently the American diplomats were amazed about the Canadian voter not having the Canadian-American relationships during the ballot in the sense, and they believe, that the visit of president Obama would have helped the conservative government with putting through their budget of 2009!
The four new communications between the American message in Ottawa and Washington that yesterday was spread in public, still more piquant details as the bare substantial contents offer which one has to puzzle over.
One of the 22nd September 2008 connection dating back, that is reported in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was contained in the full walk over from which point the United Nations do not participate in the actions discussed by their political heads anymore.
For the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the ambassador's employed in Ottawa, American.
Mr Wilkins offers different declaration possibilities of this situation.
"One the Canadians almost inherent inferiority complex necessitates arranges possibly the Canadian, political managers a lot rather in order to talk about internal disputes of the everyday life as the United States during this choice the black Peter shut (as 1988 during the campaign about the free trade) ," so he describes.
The United Nations, so he concludes, is "the proverbial Goliath of this choice" thus: omnipräsent, but potentially too alarming, in order to speak of it."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" even less since the two countries have intense political and economical relationships.
"Logically," so assessedly it, "it "should be the ability of a candidate, a party and still much more a party leader for the leading of one such essential relationship, that of the voters with the urn walk as a key factor in the sense has."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads itself in that on the 22nd January 2009 of Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, sent communication, that is supposed to prepare president Barack Obama for his first visit in Ottawa.
"Your journey will help with guaranteeing the wide heir stand of the government with the vote of confidence about the federal budget at the beginning of February in the case of which Canada" will announce" "his first deficit after more than one decade to arise due to a stimulation program in the height of 30 to 40 billion dollars," Breese describes.
Nowhere he had not mentioned that the government had had to adjourn the sitting of parliament before Christmas in order to prevent that the parliament would be flung from the coalition and the so conditional wide heir stand of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the suggested stimulation program.
Another, communication dating back of January 2008 and written on the part of the ambassador Wilkins notifies to Washington of the always negative becoming picture, that the series radiated over CBC, dramatic spread from the United States.
The ambassador is worried about broadcastings as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe few subtle allusions at Maher Arar, the "No-Fly cunning" or also payments for the purpose of through muscleman of the CIA of examinations carried out.
Again another communication reports to receive certain prisoners fully about that as Hillary Clinten asked with their French colleagues Bernard Kouchner during their first bilateral meeting for whether Europe is ready from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should the question with yes have answered, however on the basis one individual "case to case" decision.
Àm at the end of the meeting, so described, "Omar Khadr gave a paper as regards to the state secretary it, to one 15-year old Muslims of Canadian origin."
"The state secretary promised to check the acts once again."
Finally still let's say that the feelings are aroused with regard to the web page WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an old one and Stephen Harper of consultants standing very closely, had declared over CBC that those ones should "be killed" to persons responsible for this massive leakage.
He had reported here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for the renewal of the light
The UNO suggested yesterday a plan for the renewal of the light in Cancun from budget, trade and industry in 100 countries with regard to the obtaining of a decrease of the hothouse gas (FCKW) that corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that must be realized in order to stabilize the earth climate to 2020.
This ambitious plan takes his position in the step of the concrete large projects which the UNO hopes for rendering into Cancun in order to compensate the absence of compelling reduction obligations of the industrialized countries.
According to the yesterday proposed plan the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1,8 billion tons (Gt) of the FCKWs passed on due to the light onto the earth, when the white-hot pears that up to now still of 50 to 70% represent a monopoly on the market through fluorescing or better even, through LED (LED) would be replaced.
The light is responsible for 8% of the worldwide emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the waste gases of the worldwide vehicle fleet.
In Copenhagen last year had themselves the tall waste gas emitters as the United States, China, Europe and others under which also Canada counted, obliged to voluntary reduction plans that 49 Gt should turn down the global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt.
From this balance one would have to deduct, however, another 5 Gt in order to stabilize the climate rise from today up to the year 2020 around 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent that this gets out of control.
In the white-hot pears escapes from 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact phosphor pears the energy consumption reduces by 75%, with the new LED electric bulbs one reduces this energy demand again around the twofold thing.
The compact phosphor pears hold on average between 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED electric bulbs, as for example the ones that the manufacturer Philips launched this week - this society participated after all in the UNO study - have a durability of 25,000 hours and 80% of little energy use as a white-hot pear, which a hint of the saving-possibilities of the exchanging plan provides that is supposed to be used in 100 countries.
Next to the fact, that iese completely novel electric bulbs only to give very little heat, they can function also with a rheostat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists showed that compact phosphor pears show reserves since they contain mercury and that one must dispose it therefore as a requires special disposal, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except for to set the producers a counter availably.
The compact phosphor pear does not represent the main sources at mercuric emissions on the planet, however, according to the report, but rather the coal-fired power stations that emit more mercury considerably in order to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot pears.
Only in the United States these coal-fired power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report explains in detail the profits which every country would erwirtschaften thanks to this international program.
Indonesia would save so for example a billion dollars annually CO2 during the purchase of electricity and eight million tons, that means an equivalent of 3,5 coal-fired power stations whose edification Indonesia would cost 2,5 billion.
Ivory Coast expects annoyed the announcement of the election results
The "immediate" publication of the results of the premiership choice of the Ivory Coast claimed UNO-secretary-general Ban Ki-moon directly after their period of time course.
"The secretary-general underlines the necessity of the independent choice commission to receive their work and to announce the provisional results without further delay" so emphatical a press agent of the UNO leader.
"He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast for proving their responsibility and refraining to every initiative up to the announcement from the provisional results."
In spite of the pressure exerted on the part of certain foreign governments the choice commission had made the Deadline that was defined on Wednesday around midnight, three days after the choice on Sunday, without Veröffentlichkung of the results be spread.
The president of the CEI on televison had confirmed approximately forty minutes in front of period of time course, that the commission carry away with the work would become in order to announce the results.
On Wednesday multiple calls became loud from the whole world, nevertheless the CEI likes to call out the name of the winner of the second choice round at last among the Laurent Gbagbo retiring from the office and his adversary Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo-warehouse reckons, however, the canceling of "fraudulent" voice deliveries in the north through the Verfassungsrat that were achieved by the ex-rebel warehouse of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup d'etat failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, conductor of the premiership campaign of the Ivory Coast, had confirmed, that the maneuvers practised on the part of the FN for the intimidation of the voters in the north of the country had quenched the supporters of the president, to go for the choice.
The entire choice could be canceled if the complaints inserted by Gbagbo are considered by the Verfassungsrat.
The Gbagbo opponents think, however, there now more that the highest court of justice of the country is not neutral it of Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely united with Gbagbo is led.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north that denies any connection to the ex-rebels judged the delay as "unacceptable" with the announcement of the election results and asked Gbagbo for respecting these even if it has not gone so far to demand the victory.
His Bündnisparter confirm, Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results since he knows that he lost; and to submit a complaint before the constitution court after one hindered the choice commission at publishing the results seie illegal.
Was held for the coronation of the union and conciliation process of a country that was divided up in two parts over years the second round of the premiership choices on Sunday.
The United Nations had warned on Wednesday the politicians of the Ivory Coast against that, it can be held in the case of possible outrages responsibly for these.
Laurent Gbagbo had brought the first choice round at opposite the 31st October with 38% of the voices the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of the former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as a top candidate behind himself.

Accused to Alexandre Guérini and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, conductors of a disposal company and brother of the president of the general council of the region Bouches-du Rhone (Hp), a preliminary inquiry was initiated and it was committed to the prison in the course of a preliminary inquiry about the markets public and standing under fraud suspicion into Aix-en-Provence, Luynes near.
Complicity was accused to Alexandre Guérini of embezzlement of partnership assets, embezzlement of common properties, receiving of stolen goods, in corruption, unauthorized bribery and arm possession, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini combat-ready and plans to comment on all questions that the prosecution will ask him instead of spreading pipe dreams."
"It is simple to assume to him a series of punishable charges it is another thing to prove these," his lawyer Florence Rault declared the AFP (Agence France Presse) in front of the hearing of his mandator.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the hp (Parti socialiste) in the department, had considered it important, to receive to the judge before his hearing by means of his lawyers a Memoradum for his justification let.
A member Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was accused at the Wednesday evening also and arrests.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon their mandator had never done something else than to keep his dump which it had to lead to the operation.
With regard to the commercial jurisdiction or the destination of the grounds combined with that it would have never knowledge had, according to Simon.
In this Affaire also Daniel Pinna, former president of the Public service of the conurbation Aubagne, on Wednesday was accused of embezzlement and complicity, set onto free foot then, however, under the edition to keep oneself away from the protagonists of these right acts under judicial supervision again.
"My mandator could supply explanations about the facts which he was reproached for."
"The leading public prosecutor considered, not to rob him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more persons had been charged and released from the custody from the night of Tuesday on Wednesday, under that two of them under juridical supervision, so the deputy senior public prosecutor Michel Raffin.

Also the longtime companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused the "receiving of stolen goods and embezzlement of partnership assets."
Stéphane Brunengo-Girard belongs to the persons that were confronted with Guérini, recently arrests due to a similar Affaire of fraudulent machinations from public authority that had affected Corsica.
The investigators suspect his society, contributed to having, from "high" criminal circles to wash coming money.
The investigation against X because of probable fraud during the allocation of public tasks, here in particular in the disposal branch, is led in April 2009 due to anonymous writings in the acts of several open preliminary inquiries.
It follows from near investigation sources that the investigation focuses especially on the conditions of the surcharge as well as the company of a dump in La Ciotat that in the same way waste from the field of the Aubagne, as also from certain cities of the urban catchment area Marseille (MPM) gets.
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée-palace exaggerates his mediator function for Syria
Within more than six months, of July 2009 until May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher that was held in Iran because of "espionage," the French public in breath held, the diplomacy moved into alert and the deterioration of the relationships between Paris and Tehran accentuated.
This all among the attentive looks of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and checked from the newspaper "Le Monde" give away some backgrounds of this crisis.
You describe advice for the contact with their own crisis of "taking of hostages" to these as the Elysée had explained the Americans his strategy that went so far in Iran (a small group of hikers) give.
You show how the French persons responsible attempted to convince Washington of that that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman not the release of Majid Kakavand, a detained in France and from the American justice of Iranian searched due to trade with material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program to the Gegeleistung has.
Finally they set the kind and manner with which attempted to manipulate the French executive committee the media for the purpose to do to these the idea plausible the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad played a central role during the liberation from Clotilde Reiss, into a garish light.
In truth he had not done anything in this respect.
One on the 12th August 2009 into Paris' revised diplomat telegram carries the title "Iran: French comments on the kind and manner of the contact with taking of hostages."
François Richier, Elysée-consultant in strategy questions, talked in company of Patrice Paoli, director of the quay d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle Orient with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
You explained her the French method.
Those ones recommended the Americans to plant everything daran in order to reduce their own citizens that would be held violently in Iran.
"Noise does," they said, clearly and incessantly" the words "Basic human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media, "articulates.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime which pays attention to his image very sensitively.
"Practices this all the more more especially as you the Iranians ask for not doing that."
Because "Remaining silent does not dissolve anything," past the discussion attempts over on inconspicuous way, the Iranians are "Masters in evading manoevre."
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common, Iranian tactics": "Taking of hostages for the purpose of political blackmail."
It announces, the release of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (that should be achieved on 16th August, on the day at which she flees into the French message) "the payment of a great sum of money demands onto the Iranians" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he lets verlautbaren, the Elysée anticipates further taking of hostages, a phenomenon that will intensify.
The Iranians could arrest "in near future another of the about 1,800 French citizens, that live in Iran," so he said.
28th August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from the prison twelve days ago, keeps on being held, however, in Iran.
An information was circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand whose delivery the United states demand due to illegal trade with sensitive electronics material onto Iran was released from the custody according to decision of a judge in Paris.
The American message surrenders, as numerous other observers, questions about this worrying coincidence.
For Washington, that the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of that for the nuclear program pursues designated material, the release of Majid Khakavand represents a bad piece of news.
Did France accept a horse trading?
The liberation of the Iranian against that one of the Frenchwoman?
On the occasion of a renewed conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4th September François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, so he says, was only "completely does not surprise from the decision of the judge," but attempted also to revolt against that.
"It moved one exchange between the French executive committee and the French Minister of Justice given (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie) ," however "the French government can not change the judicial decision" declares, it.
Mr Richier would like to refer also to Majid Kakavand keeping on standing under "severe" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant chooses a telephone number, hangs up again, the American diplomat informs then, the Iranian "would be at the time of in the buildings led from the Iranian message in Paris."
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran the Elysée does not protect his efforts to make to believe by means of announcements and "attempts to escape" organized by the media, the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediator role."
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that the manipulation fruits supports since several press articles reflect the official French version.
One of the 25th August 2009 dating telegram causes "the media flash of the French authorities."
What is "thanks evidence" based on so much opposite Mr Assad, wonders the Paris message.
"In spite of their declarations fuller Lobpreis the French authorities admit secretly that they have only a vague presentiment of that which in fact the Syrians did."
The document deals then with the reasons which brought the Elysée for this purpose to succumb to this fiction.
The intense communication efforts "it aims at that to confirm Sarkozys to politics of the opening opposite Syria" it analyzes.
A politics launched in 2008 which then was perceived from numerous critic voices in France as well as in the exterior as too early and undeserved.
"The Syrian role blowing up" attempts "to make" to Paris "Syria which commendation one can achieve when one plays a constructive role in the region clear."
It is an objective in addition "To sow discord between Syria and Iran."
The American message knows this from good source.
On 11th August François Richier had entrusted her: "as a matter of course we do not know, whether to ever have worked the Syrians something."
"But we thanked them for all that."
"This should bring about confusion at least with the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns on 16th May 2010 to France.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysée.
In a communiqué he thanks the presidents of Brazil, the Senegal and Syria for their "active role for the benefit of the release of our compatriot."
No online-games for young men from Democratic People's Republic of Korea after midnight
The south-Korean government is mentioned a law, "the Cinderella," say goodbye, who will forbid it the young people to play after midnight Online-Games when it blocks them the access so government persons responsible pointed out.
A draft that is supposed to ask the online game operators to refuse young people the access to these games under 16 years after midnight is presented to the parliament in December, representatives of cult and family ministries described.
"Many children play this Games the whole night long and difficulties with learning have then in the school and also with that, to lead a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is necessary in order to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," declared Jo Rin, ministerial representative of the French press agency Agence France Presse entrusted with this draft.
The Online-Games are after that renewed from 6 o'clock in the morning accessible.
The manufacturer societies would have prepared for a year time for the application of the law oneself so he specified.
The government fasser in the same way into the eye, to ask the manufacturers, the time limit daily lasted for the access to these games the person responsible added to turn down to the young people that parents ask for that.
He will provide in the same way free programs which make it possible to limit the time spent in the Internet for the persons who want it.
South Korea is one thing that one at the mostly "cross-linked" one Countries, and the newspapers report regularly about events different, connected with intense internet use.
The country is in addition undisputed champion in worldwide online-Game-competitions.
In November South Korea had achieved four gold medals into the World Cyber Games opposite 58 more nations.
World championship 2018-2022: the FIFA appoints the aligner country
In bright excitement due to corruption suspicion the executive committee of the FIFA appoints on Thursday the aligner countries of the world championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in the case of which the Rangeln around influence as well as the Lobbying tend to push the technical criteria into the background.
A thing is, however, secure: the edition 2018 of the royal discipline of the FIFA will occur in Europe, their traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spanien-Portugal, Niederlande-Belgien).
The edition 2022 will turn out then a little more exotically; the International Soccer Association hopes for being able to win 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) for themselves after the premiere on the African continent in the year, or keeping on pursuing his subsidiary in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities, that to the delegation correspondingly (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of the government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) the measure of the economic and political use of a world championship pre-sets.
The machinations behind the scenes tend therefore up to the last minute to last.
In a difficult way otherwise, to make a hierarchy of the candidates.
According to the evaluation report of the FIFA, offer the English, Spanish-Portuguese one (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments as those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees to the hour of the choice.
The Sunday Times that stood with the arranging of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the disclosures could have ruined the chances just as well for their own country, cradle of the soccer, that was allowed to deliver the world championship only an only time 1966 indeed.
The BBC had given to the renewed on Monday fertile soil, when it had radiated a documentary, that three influential members of the Kommitees, that is Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under bombardment takes.
Reason enough, to annoy the FIFA and to embarrass the English persons responsible that in the first place had practiced an intense Lobbying with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The head of the government hopes for a reprint of the move succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair that had achieved the organization of the Olympic Games 2012 in the year 2005 for London.
Would this intense use suffice in order to increase the value of the image of England again before the Kommitee?
Nothing is less secure, because the duet Spanien-Portugal does not lack trumps with his already ready stadiums, his expert opinion (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and his soccer culture.
Nevertheless the economical and financial dark sides of the two countries could subdue their aspirations.
The possible reprisals against the English as well as the doubts above solvency of Spain and Portugal make the chances of Russia, which became the important outsider in spite of his gaps in the dossier (Stages, hotels, transportation), go up.
Prime minister Vladimir Putin decided, however, that frank hint onto the imputations of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" denounced on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder.
"One throws dirt at it, attempted one to compromise her," Putin cursed.
For 2022 the United States seem, strengthened through the experience by 1994 to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to show a long list of advantages opposite Japan and South Korea that made a very beautiful project separately.
Nevertheless these new candidacies seem too early for two countries which had organized the competitions in the year 2002.
Another threat: the approval of the WM 2026 for China that makes the Asiatic chances on 2022 become frail ardently desired of the FIFA.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all registers with the cleaning of futuristic stages, the FIFA pursues their extension of in the direction new areas, however, these two countries set a greater risk, because certainty dar.
Australia could have to suffer in the same way from the weakness of the TV rights (due to the delay) akquittierten of the European countries as Japan and South Korea, the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
Second mandate: the obviousness
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterand had made be believed, that he hesitates.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still little as these.
The next one calls a mandate in the Elysée.
The current head of state will be a candidate ergo in the year 2012.
But the obviousness does not stand to the page of the mystery which sticks to the premiership function well to face.
Therefore one must do as if the doubt would exist from now on.
In the one, as also in the other sense.
In 2006 Jacques Chiracs set the supporters, a third mandate is not impossible without believing even in that.
On 15th November Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious clay to make his decision "sometime in the fall of the year 2011."
That it remember at the Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of that one UMP parliamentarians the perspectives of "two mandates" would let, feverishness had spread accordingly a little bit.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far lackedly.
The president made be reminded only of the constitution change of 2008 restricting the number of the five year long terms of office only to two.
It did not do a determination, any announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the premiership choice on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous clay.
"You have in the worst case another seven and a half years with me, or at best," it declared to them in July 2009.
Onto a new one in May 2010: Does not "believe that I do not think about the phase after that."
His words of the day before yesterday do not turn him more into the candidate than on day before; but neither little.
They should cause comments, then for a twofold reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the hp on a page.
The photo of the competition with Ségolène Royal, who drives Nicolas Sarkozy for this purpose, is not to be revealed, however, itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in the year 2012, that many members of the hp earlier than accepted exhort to the challenge.
The bad inquiries on the other hand.
The voters would prefer to the first Male the rights a candidacy of François Fillon that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to inquiry of the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there are not with the UMP any discussions about that," immediately and cautiously the environment of the prime minister reacted.
"When it would be a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre informs of gathering-aryne.
"He will believe always in being able to triumph," Alain Juppé, who came with the obviousness to terms, corrects.
Euro: the EZB is forced to retain their purchases of state papers
The last meeting of the central bank council of the EZB in the last year should offer occasion to show possibilities, as one from the crisis comes out, or to announce at least the order of a great number at unconventional measures of the monetary policy that is supposed to come at the end of the year to their end.
The crisis of the European state indebtedness engages, the central bank in Frankfurt can not afford it undoubtedly, in order not to cause their aggravation, also the present, more than strained situation on the European loan markets too verwirken.
The political costs in this case would be by far too high.
The French finance minister Christine Lagarde had welcomed yesterday the role taken by the EZB, active on the occasion of a press conference for the benefit of the solution of the national budget indebtedness of Europe.
She did not dare to say, whether she thinks the central bank can do still more for example through boost of their program of the purchases of state loans.
"I keep my considerations for my European trading partners before (...) ."
Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the EZB had not shown himself very volubly on day before in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing through the economic and currency sow shot of the European parliament concerning his intentions, but had rather been satisfied, to refer to that, that the program of the purchases of state papers on the secondary market "would be practiced" and that we "will see" with the meeting on Thursday, "as the decisions turn out."
Only certainty: The EZB will leave their leading-interest at 1% as before, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In the practice the obligation purchases of the treasury were doubled by the EZB last week on about 1,35 billion euros.
And according to indiscretions of some traders she is supposed to have made yesterday new purchases at Irish and Portuguese state papers.
In total the central banks of the euro system since May carried out 2010 purchases at the level of 67 billion euros.
Among the traders the Antizipation of a follow-up of the buying rate is not doubted under any circumstances (see page 29).
The economists do not expect already any remarkable course change anymore.
If the loan businesses will already have disappeared from more than three months from the arsenal of the EZB, does latter still to get in free way at the unlimited resource reserves, and indeed over a period of a week up to three months.
The economists already set themselves off grabbedly today on that that this measure will still spread around some months.
"I can not imagine that the EZB will change their program in essential way."
"Otherwise she would accept the risk, to provoke new tensions in the short term," so Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank, presumes.
"An exit planned for the course of the first quarter 2011, progressive seems more probable to me," Norbert Bräms, economist, anticipates for his part at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of their interventions on the market of the state indebtedness "the EZB should maintain such purchase volume at obligations that stimulates the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks on the markets of the state indebtedness in the euro zone the central bank does not have any other choice than to retain their presence on the market.
"It must go for every price onto the Steller of the lacking investors on the market and act in such a way in order to prevent the rash enthusiasm about the net yields paid to the weakest states," testified an important obligation holder yesterday.
Because when the interest rates prepare for the high-altitude flight, the states would be hindered that still more, to reduce their indebtedness or only also to stabilize.
This is the price to the protection of the euro.
The government Berlusconi takes cover in Italy
According to a week beginning worrying for Italy the situation relaxed yesterday a little with the drop of the corner interests onto 10 years.
A return to the treacherous silence.
At the end of the meeting with the minister for economic affairs the region chairpersons Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and to have it with an "unpredictable" weekend reckon to hear what that Affecting, however, denied immediately.
On Tuesday anyway the scissors with the German interest rates would have achieved his record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts to the cover of the bankruptcy risk went up onto 263 points, which had caused a certain rash in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had referred near his Council of Ministers to the discrepancy of Spain for the German interest rates being near 400 base points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself, however, than "hardly gotten" by the "market turbulences" and a possible danger of infection from direction Ireland.
"The good information is that Italy, the third national economy of the euro zone, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad piece of news is that Italy as Portugal is," declares Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson institutes.
In the plain text that is called, his problem is not to be able to cover his financing need anymore the Absenz of economic growth and the accompanying, schwindsüchtigen control inputs that get the state into danger.
The last Brussels predictions were a cold shower for the government.
In the future an Italian growth is expected of 1,1% in the year 2011 and of 1,4% in the year 2012... although the budget budget present with the senate for the examination reckons 1,3% and/or 2%.
Under these conditions, so the EU commission calculates, the budget deficit will form in the next year another 4,3% of the BIP (towards that of the governments' predicted 3,9%) and 3,5% in the year 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
Therefore also the riot around a new budget collective that could be fit in from 7 billion euros after the holidays for a sum.
"When force, new economy measures must "be taken," auditor Olli Rehn means.
To the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"Is the foundation of Italy's economy all right and his accounts are controlled, we already since long time repeat that," Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund insures, who is entrusted with Italy near the IWF.
"At the moment there are not any problems, neither on short-term, still onto long-term view, there of Italy in spite of his high indebtedness (119,2% of the BIP in the year 2011, A. through R.) to be demanded smaller stabilization progress than of other countries," pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD, observes.
The question about the political unsteadiness remains.
On 14th December Silvio Berlusconi will gegenübersehen to a motion of no confindence of the chamber of deputies, due to which the preferred choices already at the end of March could be organized.
A little favorable period approaches therefore for a decision with regard to a hard crisis.
Europeans think about the expansion of the anticrisis measures
Christine Lagarde had still highlighted it explicit yesterday within the framework of a press conference in Paris: "I believe, one proved it still in the Sunday afternoon as well as also at the evening: The Europeans stick together unequivocally, are ready and engaged, to defend their currency as well as their currency area."
Although completely relative - the yesterday noted withdrawal with the interest rates of the European state obligations was water onto the mills of the governments as well as the EZB.
It can not be talked about a normalizing beginning, however, yet.
The rating agency standard & Poor's had announced, they can the fault note of Portugal, the presumably most effective target of the speculators nowadays, to reduce.
"As in May a real lack withstands the opinion of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas so at clearness and political perceptibility which burdens especially the banking systems."
Particularly, especially as "the political time goes by much more slowly than those of the markets."
The European countries which are presumably conscious of both this fissure and the danger which hides itself in that to themselves intensify the discussions for the strengthening of the already available anticrisis measures.
The informal consultations between the most directly affected Ministers of Finance and broadly speaking precede with their vis-a-vis of the G20 well.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The EZB meets today.
On the plan the lot of the unconventional measures stands for the backing of the countries of the euro zone in the cross-hairs of the markets (see below).
What concerns the EU stability grounds, so their executive director Klaus Regling already on Tuesday in Singapour began his Asia-tour in order to inform the investors of the developments in Far East with regard to the crisis in Europe.
If indeed objective of his visit is Fundraising not explicit, it prepares the terrain for this for this purpose so certainly.
The first Werpapierausgaben on the part of the EU stability ground are planned for next month.
Yesterday an official American representative of the agency of Reuters had entrusted, the United States supported a possible rise of the grounds mobilized by the additional, direct engagement of the IWF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in first row, prepare for her part, structural reforms, to take over in particular in the field of the labor market organization.
Reforms which are supposed to be added to the economy measures, yet show effects in nearer future.
To walk Lisbon and Madrid another way along than this Greece and Ireland did.
Both one, than it suits also to the other one for every price at that to avoid to have to ask for international support before they made their own budget correctives and decided on unavoidable structural reforms that in the long run the confidence returns them.
To maintain the European investors in turn about the available options, in order to speed up the normalizing process of the markets of state loans.
Axel Weber had produced, who was on 24th November in Paris on the journey, when first the idea, that if the 750 billions of euros mobilized through Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, so the union would not hesitate, to grasp the own bag renewed.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of the European state indebtedness very to the fore standing protagonist, judge, a prolongation of around the 100 billion euros would suffice, "preferably" in shape a direct liquidity syringe.
This means exists: the European mechanism of remunerated finance stabilization that is in 60 billion euros times.
An advisory board which has all chances to be examined attentively in the European capitals.
Particularly, if the market conditions worsen.

The snowfalls are considerable enough in order to cause traffic hindrances and to influence certain economic activities, predicts Météo France.
In the region Côtes d'Armor several regional streets are spaced for the heavy traffic from more than 7,5 tons, under that the traffic axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The call progress state of the secondary traffic networks in Brittany is very difficult according to the traffic policemen that warn against using the own vehicle only in the emergency, and the use of some TER coaches became the entire day over deleted.
In the Picardie the school traffic was canceled for Thursday.
For the heavy traffic no specific restricting measures were planned at the Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "calls the motorists for highest caution on the streets as well as for the corresponding adaptation of their driving behavior."
The general management for Civilian aviation (DGAC) asked the airlines to delete to Roissy and to 10% of the flights starting from Orly due to the expected, strong snowfalls % of theirs from the Paris airport on Thursday 25.
The DGAB recommends the flight passengers to contact their airline.
The airports Gatwick in the south of London as well as the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are spaced until Thursday mornings.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial rough drafts
Since the debate is on the Ile-de-France in full progress around the modernization of the traffic economy, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
One calls in particular the 23 billion at that into memory for the metro gravel of Paris, that of the Société you are supposed to be built gravel Paris.
In order to lead the start of building of the SGP into the ways, the state called out a capital donation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical pattern this is the sum which would make to give their twofold one a part of the finance sum too on the markets for the SGP possible then.
Finally today it resulted in first projections.
The supplement budget of 2010 ones, checked by the finance commission of the national assembly this morning, contains the planned measures in order to raise the first part of this money.
It is a question at that of two kinds of measures: the creation of a special tax to the Erschliessund and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France.
Erstere, so one takes articles 15 of the draft, goes "for the benefit of the public-legal institution Société du Grand Paris."
This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per annum."
Zweitere is a reorganization of the already existing enterprise taxation: "in order to modernize these, to increase around the product resulting from it and this rise of the Société you to überantworten gravel Paris."
How much would be that worth?
A puzzle.
This sum is not numbered in the text.
From the 4 billion one is far away.
It is exported that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital donation that are annoyed through the state and that Société are achieved you" gravel of Paris little by little for the project," so is to understand from the explanatory explanation.
At the SGP one does not find this system offensive at all.
"Since the moment in which one credits gains (the two taxes, through R.) one can cover the project planning for more than three years and draw it then first from the 4 billion," so is declared.
"This is noted down in the budget and deducted little by little."
The SGP estimates, that in 2013 will be begun, to note down the 4 billion for the budget 2014.
This measure, to whose 4 promised billions one still long becomes can search, danger to cause a discussion quite in motion, parliamentary runs.
The first public meeting occurs on 7th December.
Vindictive hacker and busy spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a twofold importance.
On a page it turned itself out as an obvious scandal, a scandal that only a scandal is hypocrisy that governs the Beziehunge between the states, the citizens and the press in the Sinner one.
On the Other Hand it announces far-reaching changes on international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead in turn.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file constructed by a secret service (a x-beliebigen nation) consists of press clippings exclusively.
The "exceptional," American disclosures about the sexual habits Berlusconis do not pass on anything from when that, what to read one over months in any case in every x-beliebigen journal got (except for those that owner Berlusconi is), and that frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafis offered cabaret artists already since long time material for their sketches.
The rule according to which the secret dossiers may consist only of already known news is not essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and that before in this century.
If you go into a library which dedicates itself to esotherischen publications, you will recognize that every work (about Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeats exactly what already in previous works was written.
That does not come only of the author of occult texts not wanting to publish any investigations (nor of his not knowing where news about the non-existing-end was to be found) but because those ones that dedicate themselves to the occultism at nothing different than what they already know and what confirms that they already learned believe.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
In the same way the secret files'.
The informant is lazy, and also the head of the secret service is lazy (or restricted spirit) (otherwise he could be something ever, for example editor at Libération), that takes only as true, which he acknowledges.
The Top-Secret information about Berlusconi that had sent the American message to the state department in Rome the same ones were as those ones, that Newsweek had published already the week before.
Why therefore was done such a cancelling's around the disclosures of these dossiers?
On a page these say what every educated person already knows, and indeed that the messages - at least since end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of the government can call themselves mutually or can take an airplane in order to meet for the supper - to have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some small representation tasks, to have changed into espionage centers.
Every arbitrary spectator of investigation films knows this very exactly, and it does not happen from hypocrisy, that one does so, to ignore this.
Nevertheless: the fact to repeat it in public hurts the task of the hypocrisy and is used for putting the American diplomacy in a bad light.
At second place: The idea that a x-beliebiger hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world contains the considerable stroke against the prestige of the state department.
Furthermore the scandal brings the victims less, as rather the "sharp judges" in distress.
But let's dedicate ourselves to the tiefgründigen nature of what happened.
Formerly, at Orwells times, one could bundle up all power as a Big Brother that controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwells prophecy, where one can control every movement thanks to the telephone, could have turned out since then as completely correct every made transaction, the gone hotel, the chosen motorway and so forth; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of the power.
If one keeps oneself what ends today in mind, however, that even the secret crypts of the power of no more the control of a hacker can escape, so the control walk stops, to be unidirectional and becomes circle-shaped.
The power controls every citizen, however every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as an avenger of the citizen -, can find out the secrets of the power.
How can a power which is not to keep their own secrets anymore in the situation hold itself, however?
It is right, Georg Simmel said already that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true, that any knowledge about the character Berlusconis or Merkels basically is a secret freely from Geheimis, since it gives away the public sphere; disclosing, however, in the style of WikiLeaks that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to rob her of any power.
WikiLeaks did not do either Sarkozy or Merkel Unrecht, on the other hand, however, Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this offense be that a so tremendous power was added to?
It is obvious that the states in future will not set any information reserved to more online - that would amount to a bulletin stuck up at the street corner.
But it is just as obvious, to hope for being able to keep confidential reports about telephone a secret that it is with the current technologies in vain.
Nothing is simpler than to find the way out, and when a head of state moves himself in an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could relationships private and certain only for certain ears be maintained in future?
I know very presumably that my forecast at the moment according to Science Fiction and novelistically rings, but I see myself forced to introducing the government agents to me in secret way busily on uncontrollable routes moving, their communications nowhere differently wearing than in the bare memory with themselves, and in addition the few written information that they got hiding in the heel.
The information would be stored in single copy in shut drawers: basically the espionage attempt of Watergate had to record less success, as WikiLeaks.
I had the occasion to write that the technology strides nowadays as a cancer backwards indeed.
A century after the radio-controlled telegraph had revolutionized the communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogous) video-cassettes had made for the film researchers possible, to spy out a film band for band when one could wind from behind forward and ventilate all secrets of the Mondays, during the (numeric) CDs nowadays nothing else facilitate, than to jump from chapter to chapter, therefore in macroportions.
With the high-speed trains one brings from Rome within three hours Milan, while this is requiring three and a half hours by airplane including the change.
It is not therefore extraordinary that politics and communications system come back to car and horse.
A last observation.
In Former Times the press attempted to understand which secrets were forged between the messages.
The messages that require confidential information of the press are it current.
Climate: how France talks his finance promises beautifully
A year according to the Copenhagen contract is it time, the compliance of the quickly solved financing promises (also "Almost start or mentioned too early financings) " examine, that were realized by the developing countries.
And already the coarse French beautiful chatter is uncovered.
With the Copenhagen contract the developing countries committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars in between 2010 and 2012.
The EU promised 7,2 billion euros over three years, France 1,26 billion euros (that is 420 million per annum).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 the EU drew all registers in order to convince their partners of the fact of their engagement concerning the fasting-start-financings: detail-true procedure report of their member states, press conference, great secondary events, brochure distribution.
The operation transparency is estimated remarkably and currently for their actual value: the developing countries and the civil society would see gladly if all developed countries did the same one on the same precision level.
The EU announces to have released 2,2 billion euros in the year of 2010, which gets her onto the correct way to the Respektbezollung of their engagement from 7,2 billion in the year 2012.
If one, however, looks into the detail, the things are a little bit more complicated.
This money should be "new and additional" according to the Copenhagen contract in order to guarantee that an additional use was brought in without gereichen to the detriment of the Public Development Aid.
Unfortunately there is not any consensus over what "again and besides" means.
While the EU commission had been suggesting a harmonization, certain member states have, under that France, the procedure jams.
Today everyone chooses the standard value which he takes as best.
The EU commission has itself for example as a standard value for that one of the year 2009 chosen: keep to becoming the international financings, and contributes within the framework of the financing "Fasting-start" above for three years 150 million.
Other countries chose similar standard values either with regard to year or concerning conditions on level of the public development aid.
In the corresponding train for this purpose France thought the financings of "all new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional."
Differently squeezed out: There are not any standard values with the editions of the preceded year or on global level of the public development aid.
Actually said the total amount of the French support of the developing countries can remain stable (or also to lose weight) - France pretends to keep to his obligation with regard to the "new and additional" financings.
An other, decisive element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
Yet no rule dominates that, and everyone chooses his rake mode.
Unites, as for example France, 1 lent € as equivalent with 1 donated € are.
Obviously this is only hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (projects often tied to the emission embankment that are based on most effective technology) can be justified, it is treacherous to present the euro that one vereinnahmt as an equivalent for a donated euro... Furthermore only the costs of the loan should be charged as engagement for the investor country (that is the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France does not have anything differently in the sense as the following consideration: his obligation "respects" it of 420 million euros, when it incorporates 91,5% of loan (389,8 million euros) and he donates 8,5%) 36,1 million euros) - see also the EU document, in order to convince oneself even of that.
France is the only one land the EU that loan starts in great measure.
Germany demands 46%, during Denmark, that Netherlands or to follow Slovakia (among other things) to their obligations to 100% with donations.
Differently said if the predominant majority of the European Union 1€ for the fulfillment of their obligations distributes France just gives 10 cents once and means by that a comparable use.
Beautiful hocus-pocus!
All in all France operates in his fasting-start-financing with a double giddiness: to a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action about the time and to the other part with the reality of the financial use.
France succeeds in making believe that it has distributed 420 million "new and additional" millions in agreement with his promises and saves in this case 36,1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Exchequer could involve (since it presumably seems that it was Bercy that carried out the arbitrage) a twice negative effect; once EU internal (why the other member states leave with the donating if nevertheless it suffices to lend?) and then in the negotiations not completely deceive the developing countries there make...
The chapter of the too early financings only a small question onto relatively short time in comparison with the entirety at discussions about the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let's hope for this not being the case.
As is to that ever, it is indispensable to learn his lesson of financings anticipated from this first year.
In the First Place France could announce a change in his posting kind for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit indeed the respect's for his obligations and the balancing justice's with the other countries of the European Union.
Particularly, however, France could bring the discussions forward about the quarrel object of the long-term financings (an other, decisive and currently discussed topic): one does not escape the question of the "Verrechenbarkeit" or the posting kind of his loans.
France could change his position in order to be just as advanced with regard to the disputes as it is that near other things.
The hope is based therefore on the new environmental minister Kosciusko-Morizet that will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about the fasting-start of France and his vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of loans would raise by nature the international confidence basis which is necessary for weiterführende discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes 81 different chemical substances over the day, one like that this Wednesday of the union Générations Futures (former movement to the protection of the rights and the respect rising generations') published study.
The union that declares that their results "faced with the small number at analyzed tests do not display any statistically significant value but to represent illustration character of the handled problems," had between July and September the usually within four, from an approximately ten year old child to the meals food consumed plus a Zwischenmahlzeit in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris bought.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1,5 liters of water per day - were examined just the same as nibblings of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants were.
The plate balance is shattering: 81 chemical substances, under that 42 than possibly or probably krebserregend classified and five than surely karziogen classified, in the same way as 37 substances with Endokrinin disturbance, according to studies of several institutions as for example the International oncology center.
"Even if in the approximate entirety of the cases the legal limits are not exceeded for every chemical, individually charmed substance, nevertheless one understands from this elevation very well so, that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to materials cancer-moving possibly or substances with Endokrinin disturbance concern is exciting," the union notices.
Contained already during the breakfast only the butter and the tea with milk already more than ten the remains cancer-moving possibly and three surely proven as carcinogenic, in the same way as more than twenty remains that can influence the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, designated as a Zwischenmahlzeit for the study, Spuren points from six chemical substances, under that a fungicide forbidden in France.
The same one is valid for the green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, at which one thing found the study tracks in the EU of severely prohibited insecticide.
Further also the cutlet, the tuna from the can, even the French loaf and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical materials were larded.
Near the tap water the analyses brought the presence of nitrates and chloroform onto the light.
During the supper the salmon steak with 34 determined, chemical remains was at the "most extensive," and even the plastic plate used to the warming up of the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The end-final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "becomes probably undervalued," so the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV) suggested for her part "faced with the priority of the situation" to introduce a moratorium about the use from pesticides in order to stop the "increase at ailments of civilization."
In July a study of the European authority had identified reference to the presence of remains for food security (EFSA) in 365 different, pesticides identified in fruit and vegetable, that are consumed in Europe, under that 76 in Getreiden.
