The lack of snow in the mountains are concerned hoteliers
Not only the peacekeepers telesquíes in Krkonoše worry about the runways without snow.
The lack of snow makes people do not reserve ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That is why, in Krkonoše can still be getting free rooms for all winter dates, including for Christmas Eve and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors in our pages.
People looked tenders, finds prices, but still fears book with commitment.
And if we call them, wondering immediately on our view, if this Christmas, there will be snow or mud, "he mentioned the mantenedor of information portal Jandura Spindl.Info Martin.
Those who want to move into a Špindlerův Mlýn Nochevieja according to their expectations, should not hesitate more in reserve stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in the second place, they can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers of Špindlerův Mlýn offer especially weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I believe that the will continue to offer, but soon will bend and offer shorter stays.
And then the rooms free will be sold quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all the dates for the winter.
Now, what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of places offered remains free.
That is why we have already prepared some Christmas stay at the last moment, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The travel agency of Vrchlabí can still offer also New Year 's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer places free.
Sold very well, also the first 14 days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold to regulate.
This year's interest in the winter stay is hampered by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
The people are waiting to see whether there will be snow.
No one wants to move to the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
If the roads remain snowfall during the week, the dates of Christmas will run out too, "said Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to fill the rooms in the hotel HORIZON in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We are around five per cent better.
For Christmas and the New Year 's Eve, we have the latest free places.
The Polish interest increases during holidays in January and February were also sold well, "said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty per cent of the New Year's Eve stays are already engaged in the omnia Hotel, near the central parking Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the latest hotel Janské Lázně at Christmas half the beds is still free.
This January was a great surprise to us, because we are about to sixty percent of the capacity of occupation.
February has been a bit weaker, but as soon as snow falls, the interest in stays in Krkonoše will surely mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel omnia.
For the moment, however, it appears that the guest of Krkonoše they will pass the appetite of snow waiting.
On Thursday, should fall temperatures and, if there is rain, in the mountains should nevar.
But then again, temperatures will rise, reported Jiří Jakubský Hradec Králové, the Hydro-Meteorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: The repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of a man more intelligent, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, he took on the most stupid.
When it finally revealed his Afghan approach, waited anxiously, demonstrated that there is a copy of the script used in Iraq by Bush, established three years ago.
Not only in the same text uses a number of times the phrase “ just like in Iraq ", but did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 for his own statement:" A new way forward ".
It was he himself who three years ago, Bush criticized the idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering by civil war, and that criticized it as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following month, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of captains of area, was the only possible and successful, so that today we are not talking about Iraq in the news.
The reputation of Bush did not improve, however objectively left his successor an initial situation much more favourable than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
Field captains returned to ask him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even though the traditional subordinate relationships, proceeded to the Rifles undecided in the White House to a harsh criticism.
It requested 40,000 men in order to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not think of anything better, so at least misled the general about 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe he promised another 5,000, although he previously had at least 10,000.
The most troublesome of the entire strategy of Obama seems to its objective, begin to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to finish this process in three years. The entire doctrine of Obama generated more questions than answers that offered.
Many doubt that the increase would give the same fruit that the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, the society of Iraq is relatively well organized, its leaders to respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: It is not possible to rely on anyone and there is no agreement.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to train the Afghan national security forces, if they are used to change the head every day, according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village after he will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely problematic because of the connections confused, even more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even establish a state that is “ capable of action, "a minimum target for the entire operation, it seems very real.
The horizon of the strategy of Obama clashes by your will.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate, and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who know nothing from reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "will quickly return home," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, set the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will see this as a statement of indirect American defeat.
The last NATO summit demonstrated that Europeans have less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians did not know, and do not want to explain to their constituents, what relationship is the security of Germany or Italy with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, can affect radically to the situation, it is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and increased sanctions would not have any impact on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: To try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to find the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America triumphal advance of the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, every solution that will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years for the presidential election and that is why there is still plenty of time to find another strategy, whichever is a total failure.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses
Senior executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity as announced in reacting to the harsh criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of cash, shares that cannot be sold at a minimum period of five years.
Moreover, the actions may be withdrawn in the event that they had assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to bring together the bonuses on Wall Street with the power over the long term.
I suppose that Wall Street is fully aware of the way longer than it should undertake, mentioned the former investment bank JPMorgan Douglas Elliott of the entity.
The devil is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs faced criticism after having (almost $17 billion (nearly $300 billion CZK) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, probably exceed, despite the measures announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, in a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a tax of 50 per cent, the bank bonuses for up to 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories less Physics
Five women, which is a record, received today in Stockholm in the hands of the king of Sweden, Karl XVI Gustavo Nobel Peace Prize winners this year, in categories and specialised in literature.
In addition to the four scientific, was among the Honorees also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in medicine as received two biologists Americans Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider and Jack Szostak for his compatriot research in the field of human chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded the Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz by the explanation of the structure and function of the ribosomas.
The latter prize awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which received the American Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson his compatriot for the analysis of an economic report.
The only category specialized, without winning a woman, was Physics.
This award it received today scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, Willard Boyle and George Smith with the invention of the chip CCD, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each winner collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and certificate of the money received.
This amount in each category is up to 10 million Swedish kronor (approximately 25 million koruny).

In his speech acknowledged the dispute have been rewarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars, in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In order to defend its policy added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even though its price is high.
The minister Janota believes the resignation. Klaus he invited the Castillo
The president Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning to finance minister Eduard Janota, which is considering his continued rule, because it does not agree with the version of the state budget for the coming year, adopted on Wednesday by the chamber of deputies.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps even the permanence of Janota in the cabinet, will be the topics of a meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis in public finances.
On the citation reported the spokesman for the president Radim Ochvat.
On their stay in the role, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget bill, ready to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of $163 million kroner.
The chamber of deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the proposals from the left for transfers of funds and increased the money for staff salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, because covertly increase the budget deficit.
Among the left on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and right on the other, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Because of this conflict, are beginning to be controversial future activities of the cabinet bureaucratic Fischer, whose form was agreed in the spring by ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the House of Representatives, de facto liquidates the package saving, imposed in the fall by the government of Fischer to curb the public debt.
Klaus cannot but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians long-neglected "a serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him today, no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can support in a broader consensus among the political parties, could improve this situation, believes the president.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
The vice-president of ODS, Petr Nečas, said that the concept for ČTK bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described words like "judgments strong."
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Mirek Topolánek. Will surpass $200 million.
On Wednesday ČSSD said that the adoption of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The popular also were happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
South Africans say that the new Hollywood movie, Invictus: Invincible, he tells a lot about the country, their struggle and their victories, though some critics say that lead roles played by the American players.
The story spoke of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the US actor who won an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years, requested that he interpreted in the film of Eastwood.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said to him: "When I read, I will have to have access to You.
The actor seventy-two years, who received the prize for his role in the drama of Eastwood on the world of boxing Milion Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which was still a slave, the fictional president of the US, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, it is just as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for their efforts to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years, became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus -- invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem in the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk as he
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the team of South African rugby, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that post-apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that it is capable of uniting his people through sport, and that is why it was decided to join rugby players, who belong in the global measure to outsiders.
The South African team failed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for the history of Mandela came to cinemas.
He has no other aim to play this role in such a way that was as close as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the global political forces committed in the same area, I would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to estrecharle hand to Mandela.
I discovered that the apretarle hand, get their energy, it is transmitted and had the feeling to know how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon played the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was when I finally met for the first time with Pienaar at home.
I remember being knocked on the door, he opened and the first thing that I told François Pienaar in my life was: "In the movie I seem much higher".
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the players and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and it also talks of ambitions for the Oscar.
The critical film magazine, Daily Variety's Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a film very well done."
The reviews of films on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received a 76 per cent of positive evaluations.
The secret of the splendour on Norway resolved: The Russians did tests of a missile
In Norway, there was a special luminous effect of unknown origin.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia finished recognizing yesterday that near the border with Norway made evidence of an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The missile-type "Bulava", previously designed to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and the prime minister, Mr Putin.
Even his continuing presence in the evidence of the missile has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, went flying or there was a fault in the air.
In Russian newspapers write “ Bulavá ” and “ a missile that it flies. "
A missile that do not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was initially no problem.
At the end of the flight occurred of new technical problems in the apparatus.
Probably the engine broke out in the third phase of the missile.
This time, "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes the launch from a boat that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
It is therefore likely that the light mysterious on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, in reality outside the failed "Bulavá."
The Norwegians like from the first moment did not hesitate with a Russian missile.
This time, the generals are saying that cannot be simply talk of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile aguantaron and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases were immediately averiaron engines in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without mistakes, according to the management of the Ministry of Defence only six out of thirteen were failed.
The success of nearly a 50 percent full of optimism to the generals and therefore continue to claim that “ Bulavá "one day fly without problems and even will take up to ten blocks hipersónicos nuclear, whose total weight limit is $1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed the 51 years an annual contract with CSKA Moscow

The former world champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly will play on Friday in mourning KHL against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov ended his career at the age of forty years in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was hurt, we urgently need to another defender.
Fetisov practised constantly and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal affairs, cited the agency AP to Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the club of Moscow.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single party.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who managed to lift the mood of the other players, he mentioned Nemchinov.
According to AP if Fetisov returned to the ice runway, will become the professional player over the long-ruling Russian hockey.
The legendary striker Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one years ago, during the entire season, and won 15 goals and 26 attendances.

Hyundai complied with the requirements of the unions. Cancelled all the extra work
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions cancel all the extra work.
It is precisely because of the frequent extra work, unions said on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman of the factory of automoviles Hyundai.
The leadership, however, wants for this year to agree with the trade unions a time for Saturday.
We cannot resign ourselves to our plan of manufacture, because it is essential, which is why we proposed a voluntary extra work for Saturday, 19 December, that is to say, it will work in two shifts, said Vaněk.
According to the server Sedmička.cz, the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 employees to work the turn on Saturday.
The bonus will be paid for last Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate their employees with the extra work offered.
Employees can collect the bonus for overtime or can take a day off on 28 December, i.e., prolonging a day Christmas festivities Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all employees of the shift from Saturday, will receive money for travel and for food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and challenging comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, paralyzing the production last week, the direction yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the extra work for the month of December, mentioned Vaněk.
The employees of the factory's cars were forced to work two hours more than eight-hour shifts and this continued practically every day until last week.
After signing the agreement with the unions will cancel the emergence of strike.
Another negotiation between the leadership of the factory and trade unionists must be carried out on Monday morning.
The head of the unions Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they pledge to meet the requirements and the signing of the document, are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation in the auto factory deepened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike by frequent extra work.
Also protested against the poor conditions of payment and the alleged harassment.
The leadership was of the view that the employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and power supply cars.
Trade unionists in his declaration of emergency by strike on Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the manufacture, would be penalised in any way.
With regard to the extra work, the unions are demanding that the company is reduced to a minimum.
In addition, this year required for this work remuneration of 5,000 crowns.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai now has 2,000 employees.
In the series was launched last November.
Until last September manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: A substance effective until in the 'encallecidos' HIV virus
The team of German and Czech scientists is evidence of new compounds capable of moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this substance enhanced is the fact that it is also effective against viruses resistant to medicines.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs already accessible.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, patients' lives could be prolonged significantly, thanks to a combination of medications that inhibit the replication of the virus in the body.
However, their use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely removed, will create the so-called resistant virus; against them, no longer work medicines.
The work of the experts of three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the ability to dominate the resistance of the virus.
They showed that the substances called metalocarboranos have an effect on the albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranos are composed of boron and hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus in a different way of all drugs used today, and therefore cannot solve the problem of resistance.
In its work, scientists are finding new, ‘ improved ’ compounds, equipped with knowledge of the molecular mechanism of its link to the albumin of the virus.
The only metalocarboranos have a three-dimensional structure: Two cages poliedros composed of atoms of boron and hydrogen and carbon are united by the atom of metal, in this case by deposits.
A traitor and resilient virus
The proteasis HIV is a albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the proteasis of HIV, there is the fragmentation of the HIV virus and not create mature and infectious virus corpúsculos.
If we stop the proteasis HIV, stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists explained in a press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see chart) are united by a short organizational series, which continues to be modified systematically.
A little weaker, but more effective
The evidence of the impact of this series of substances against proteasis HIV was conducted in test-tube, and also against resistant variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of the metalocarboranos common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in medicines used clinically, however, not lose their effect on the alternatives that are resistant to those medications often do not work.
The mechanism of the single outcome, his other qualities as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, which are compounds metalocarboranos interesting for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, said Pavlína Řezáčová, the head of the laboratory of the Structural Biology at the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetica's Institute in Academía of science.
Fight over the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for next year is "appalling" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, thinking its future existence.
The statements of ODS were identified by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say that it is time for analysis.
The vice-president of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the cabinet bureaucratic with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas the prime minister had to decide if in the chamber of deputies wants to be in the minority, which seeks to combat the growing deficit, or if he wants to stay in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democración towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, warned Nečas.
The House of Representatives yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however, with the proposals for amendment by the left, by more than 12 billion kronor.
The chamber of deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused the proposals of ODS, since cubiertamente increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of $163 billion kronor.
ODS before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the desire of government, that the amended budget is better than an interim budget.
Disillusion and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota, spoke of disillusionment and the sense of futility; the prime minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threaten the resignation in the event of adoption of the proposals modificadoras, the situation could be different.
According to Česká televize Janota requested a meeting with the prime minister.
Pointed out, that he is planning to stay in the role.
The reason is his disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer will agree with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in government have nothing to do the nominated by the ČSSD, which imposed changes in the budget.
The prime minister also should clearly say, if you will resign if the camera adopt other pieces of legislation that would increase the deficit, for example those relating to subsidies in disease, income, or to the amendment of the law of service.
Topolánek: The ministers nominated by the ODS are not at fault
It is the subject of Prime Minister Fischer and throughout the government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not done anything wrong, he stressed Topolánek in the news text of the US.
He recalled that in a number of ministries in positions of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that Fischer decided to resign ourselves to the principle of the fight with the height of the deficit in the public finances, "it is completely logical and correct, which is based on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies."
But it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of members of ODS.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will deal with this, told reporters in the chamber of deputies, the defense minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by members of ODS.
The Prime Minister Fischer afternoon came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS ceded at the request of the prime minister
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the House of Representatives is likely to vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly request to Members of ODS for the acceptance of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, reacted to the question, if ODS is not concerned by the absence of the head of the party in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I realized that my vote would be weakened.
The resignation of the mandate he knew that in the following months they were especially bolchevización of the chamber of deputies and the destruction of everything good, reacted Topolánek itself.
According to the new timetable ČD trains will be fewer trains by almost the same fee
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restringuirán some fast trains and local less used and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by 2% compared to the present day, hours after the new trains will enter into force.
The majority of charges including the basic price and customer will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital gain for example of the region's inhabitants of Ostravsko, dráhy unacarretería pendolino added to this line.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not move to Bratislava.
In line with Prague - Pisek - České Budějovice will be fewer fast trains, restringuirán Prague - Letohrad direct links.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by dráhy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight per cent in total, on the contrary, the transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
It also cancelled two trains at night in the charts Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and some fast trains on the line between Prague and Pisek - České Budějovice will be reduced to only a few days of the week.
One of the most significant changes is the introduction of a new hotline of Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice must change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the No 15 line of system Esko, on the outskirts of cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line of Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
The links to long distances to the capital will end up in the station Prague Hlavní nádraží.
ČD will introduce more links between Prague and SC Pendolino trains in Ostrava and Šumperk / Jeseník move every two hours.
As of 13 December travellers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account by the regional rail this year: $200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the losses Dráhy demonstrable calls will be answered in the coming year four billion kronor in total, like this year. Local trains are responsible for the regions, next year will pay eight billion kronor in total, and the rule will help them almost three billion.
This year, 200 million regional trains are more expensive.
For the fast trains and local dráhy have a new contract for 10 years, until now the contract was always a year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why did not increase the price of a large majority of the tickets.
The changes will occur only in tickets a day -- ČD Net and cheap tickets on the internet eLiška.
For travelers without customer card ČD Net will increase the price of 450 kroner to 600 kroons.
The price of eLiška depends on the distance, until now there was a single price of 160 kroner for travel between any two cities in the region.
Filipino armed continue to detain more than 50 people, children were released

In the coming days will close in American cinemas, a new Hollywood movie, Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech esInvictus: Neporažený), which captures a portion of the biography of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid activist, is played by Morgan Freeman, who chose years ago for the leading role the very Mandela.
The second paper, the legendary champion Francoise Pienaar in rugby, as interpreted Matt Damon.
With the premiere born of the reactions of the critics and the public
Nelson Mandela,
Its full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. Was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988, she received the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, awarded in 1993, together with the de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
Great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time when, in the Republic of South Africa culminate preparations for the World Cup in soccer. At the same time, the media are reeling from alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants of the dominant black majority.
According to the news agency AP, reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of lead roles for the "uninspiring" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman however said, he is proud of the film new.
For many years he dreamed of the role and I am prepared to play it well.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, for - as they say - charge its energy, said in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it is a good thing, whether through the film we can remember the man and the message of Mandela.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, perose concerns around the world, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by the British author John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game. Thanks to this game was born the nation. Portrays the South African champion of human rights during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and during long years separated. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he was also a costume of the South African national rugby team and falls to the playground. RSA won at that time the world cup.
By entering the gramilla in costume, that RSA is seen as something almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won loud sustained applause, mostly white audience and the recognition of the white population.
The football World Cup it will help people to unite and form a nation, mentioned the rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Still remains to be seen if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
White South Africans, however, are sceptical, as he said, for example in an interview recently for LN an amateur rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The tournament starts on 11 (June 2010.

Earlier the fire service wanted to let the processor was destroyed by the fire, but later changed their minds and the flames were put out with a mixture of water, and a fire extinguisher foam special.

Jančura will submit a complaint for slander to three hetmánes of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will submit a complaint for slander to three hetmánes socialdemocráticos.
It is the region's Michal Hašek Jihomoravský Kijówcki, Radko Martínek of Pardubický Kijówcki and hetmán of Olomoucký Kijówcki Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in 20 minutes in Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the effort of the company, maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions but ended up signing contracts to the long term with České dráhy.
All three hetmánes are attacking us and they talk about the fact that we are "taking raisins of the cake", yet came away with only the offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the price of České dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have no other thing to defend ourselves.
It is for slander towards society Student Agency, said to Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time have the evidence from all regions. According to him have not taken measures in line with European law.
That is why is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek finds this claim by the continuation of the show medial of Mr Jančura, which serves as the free publicity for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my reputation and my region and I appeal to the remaining hetmánes to do so as well.
I suppose, also on this occasion will show clearly that Mr Jančura manipulates the public on the issue of the regional rail transport, and uses arguments liars and false, mentioned Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million kroner in advertising, whose objective would be to warn of these measures of the regions.
To Radiožurnál told him that interrupiría the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue after the New Year.
Clarified that the campaign will be carried out against the corupción as such.
Jančura launched the campaign after the regions were agreed with České dráhy in maintaining regional rail links and for the commissioning of about 150 billion kronor not convened an aim.
According to Jančura similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a Member of ČSSD, owing to his criticism of transport ferroviaro in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we leave, we will lose the licences of buses.
It was presented as a Member of ČSSD, I know, of what Mr is, I am not going to say his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
The vaccine will be free and voluntary neumococal
The vaccine neumococal starting in January will put an end to the usual habits.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time, on a voluntary basis.
However already appear views, that the vaccine compulsory would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcus culminate.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting maximum prices of vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts also already have this clear in the procedure of vaccination.
The new vaccine
Free vaccinations for children born in August
Starting in January will receive a free vaccine neumococal children born since 2 August last year.
The condition is that it has not received a single dose of the vaccine soon.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or earlier, you have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine has to be received between the third and fifth month of age of child.
Last year, a quarter of families left voluntarily to vaccinate their children against pneumococcus.
Parents, however, paid by a dose 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children needed four doses.
Usually experts estimate that insurance companies will spend in vaccines from 300 to 450 000 kroons annually.
However save in the treatment, which is needed for children are not vaccinated.
Until now, the state spent across the vaccination of children around 500 000 annually.
The vaccination cover was initiated by the so-called package of Janota.
The pneumococcus is the cause of the otitis media, but also of the serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
Neumococales infections in our country die each year, according to research in the hospitals 28 children not over the age of 10.
In addition to the Czech Republic cover neumócocal vaccine in children was introduced in about 40 countries.
Could it be compulsory the vaccine?
However, at the same time appear views, that this vaccine could be compulsory in future.
Starting in January must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The compulsory vaccination would be better, he noted for example, Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
His association spreads vaccines neumococales already long ago.
The experts at an international conference, in which AIMFR participated, were not completely satisfechoscon the fact that we have the vaccine voluntary.
It is not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy, to achieve at least this.
I believe that this is the path that we now have to undertake, mentioned Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against pneumococcus.
At the moment I do not feel in any way, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, say doctors
The president of the society of paediatricians Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its drawbacks.
If all children receive the vaccine, they may think about the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs a sum so high, relatively understand the political decision to initiating vaccination as a voluntary," said Cabrnochová.
The experts expect that from next year more than 80 percentage of young parents leaves vaccination against pneumococcus their babies.
The vaccine neumococal is a major change, too, because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health-care companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, in order to save then in treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors have to buy the vaccine for themselves.
But pediatricians are worried about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, the vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Members, however they were afraid, that insurance companies might "get the money on health insurance."
Doctors so they will have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40 000 per month, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, said Cabrnochová.
Still them and us
Could the Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a State Lay.
At a time when the Swiss voters have been asked to ban the construction of minarets and that there is a general warning about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a detailed report and studied on the possible integration of Muslims (which in fact are integrating) in one of the most avowedly secular societies of the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the latest work from the author of “ Why the French do not like the Veil "(" Why the French Don't Like Headcarves ") (2006), a study in detail and elegant argued a problem that divided and troubled the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
The latest book by Mr Bowen has a broader perspective and more ambitious.
As a good anthropologist, wants to know not only what they are telling politicians and media about Islam in France, but what is actually happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and colleges that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls “ Islamic spaces. "
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students on the questions that matter most to them.
Should a Muslim marriage at a mosque or in a council (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims on the evolution and gay rights?
Could a Muslim woman marrying a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim uses a banking system based on interests to obtain a mortgage?
These issues are seemingly mundane, argues, things in everyday life, those that concern the means more than the political drama.
The author identifies a new generation of priests, teachers and intellectuals, none of them well known, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an academic and Arab Muslim scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation trying to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They fail to spread this argument altogether.
The Conservatives doubt just the idea of a French or European Islam.
Thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interview tend to disagree with their counterparts from Salafi, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that the Muslim values and secularism French could be compatible.
But the adaptation requires mutual concessions.
He questioned the extent to which policymakers French (and the intellectual elite who fiercely defends secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
He suggested that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfair for Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments with secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, sees “ an adjustment of values ".
Could the Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say “ Yes, but not yet. "
The picture of the world's most devastating
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other habitats on the planet.
Defining the ice is melting at an alarming speed, and took away the life that cannot survive elsewhere.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have been approached in waters recently open, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result of this.
In “ on thin ice ” (“ On Thin Ice ") Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and politics of whaling, describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence at face value the white bear.
The meeting of the Admiral Nelson as a courageous cadets in 14 years, struggling just to the side of your foot, is certainly a myth, but others are real.
The offspring, caught swimming along the bodies of their mothers newly exterminated, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A presentation of circus at the beginning of the twentieth century, displayed to 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the premises of zoos are still generally a billionth of the area of the scope of an adult savage. The climate is almost never fit: A polar bear living in Singapore was green with algae that grow within the zones without mincing his stripe.

Ellis resorts to stories from other writers and historians, and often returned to the threat that hunters presented to the survival of the species.
Although it is banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Indians Eskimos motonieves use in high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two nations cazadoras where the ice will last for longer.
In his new book, “ After the ice ” (“ After the Ice ”), Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, provides a clear and chilling tale about the science of the Arctic and a shocking glimpse of how we can transform the future of that place.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmospheric scientists nor the oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It is not for lack of effort.
The travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century gave evidence for the first time about the movement of the masses of ice.
Then the submarines in the Cold War drew up a map of the movedizos cordons of ice flowing beneath the masses of ice.
The scans by satellite and the extensive series of probes fitted into the icebergs are a useful supplement, but individuals resistant camped out in the cold even perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson look inside the extraordinary, tiny world tributary system within the Arctic ice, comprising chorritos of saline water that is pressed while freezes.
But since the bear in the microscopic surface until the wonders of the interior, were all sentenced once the ice in summer will be withdrawn, which is believed could happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.

Marines among the 6,000 that placed wreaths on the graves of Arlington
Pfc. De 'Angello Robinson, 19, travelled seven hours by bus to place a wreath at the grave of a soldier who had never known.
For him and the other Marine who travelled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., at the national cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once they start in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we, I would like to see someone do the same for me, so just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning for placing wreaths on the graves of veterans in various sections of the cemetery in Arlington.
In 1992, Mr. Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Company Worcester Coronas in Harrington, Maine, launched the event when he and others chose to decorate several hundreds of graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
In what is already a tradition of 18, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year halted in different cities along the way, to perform events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event into other states.
This year, more than 16,000 volunteers laid wreaths on the graves of the cemetery in Arlington, areas in the Pentagon, graves in the cemetery of Fayetteville in Arkansas National Park of the battery in New York City and the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and carry the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career soldier died.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way to give a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It is like visiting a grave of family.
Wrapped in layers of linen warm, volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to older graves of World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War, because there are so many visits as the new graves, said organizers.
The atmosphere was joyful, while the children were playing and couples were taken in hand, while wearing a fresh pine to headstones sepulcrales.
Every krona circular was a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Near there, the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, had been virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the soldier) donated 1,000 kroner to decorate the section, but the grim atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends were supported each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others were inclined to see small white and black plates laid within the wet clay, for those whose headstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who enjugaban tears from their eyes in front of the grave of her son.
Handled eight hours of Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of marine artillero Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should never forget why we are free.. My son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone can remember."
Cuban officers arrested a contractor to the US government
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor to the US government, which supplied mobiles and laptops in the country, said on Saturday, State Department officials.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives, Inc, headquartered in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the Agency for International Development of the United States and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the US Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, but according to the law of Cuba, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything deemed "dangerous".
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include minor protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
The graffiti and anti-government speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a budding blogger community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about as she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
SÁNCHEZ has called for on several occasions permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permission had been denied.
The detention of an American contractor can cause probably tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a rapprochement "at a slow pace" to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy stresses that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity of part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new products and coveted in a country where the average wage of a worker of government is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile only this year; they are used mainly for text messages, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited in the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and the hotel for foreign visitors, and at one establishment of government, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the US Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of American citizens at the prison in Cuba is behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said that he could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as delivering mobile for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program for Human Rights Watch, which recently released a scathing report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba," a reference to the site of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in a day.
He stated that any settlement would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are beginning to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials desenmarañan a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities rendered harmless to the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, travelling on the Internet in search of young radicalized.
The researchers said they were chasing a shadowy insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them commented approving terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah led to men once were in Pakistan, trying to help them to reach the remote area in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is a familiar place for Al-Qaeda and their terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince the commanders of al-Qaeda that men were not part of a plot by the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, they are closed for several days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason, were rejected, said the official, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not inmutaron and even were trying to get the proper approval to gain access to the camps of al-Qaeda, when the police authorities Pakistani operatives.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, stressed the critical role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determine who cannot be trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence chief has made it a priority to try to infiltrate people within al Qaeda.
Recruiters from the organization act as guards, not leaving move those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that al-Qaeda analyses with special attention to the recruits Americans aspirants.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, due to its potential to gain access to American objectives and due to its propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups also have become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because the American intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the model of recruitment what so many have already gone? Said Kohlmann.
It has been transformed into a model based far more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand "action" climate
On Saturday, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here through the streets demanding the negotiators who work in the Convention Centre, Bella Center in the city, bolder action on climate.
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a cluster of government buildings in the city centre.
In a day in which just happened in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists marched through the town, holding placards in English, saying, "There is a planet B" and one in English declaring, “ Earth said 'enough is enough'.
Several celebrities joined the protest, even the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel Peru, the home country of her mother, made me aware of the distressing matters with which the country must deal due to the impacts of climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I decided to join the large demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders, to present a fair, ambitious and binding, said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to duck for longer.
The police prevented the protesters approach too much at the Bella Center, and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the use of masks or by carrying out of pocket knives.
Under Danish law, those activities are banned during the demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified because they were involved in the climate talks, some activists with sporting masks and black dresses planted several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were in the buildings, he said, adding that began as venting, but that was followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seemed to penetrate the conscience of key staff such as Su Wei, China's chief negotiator on climate.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was taking a constructive impact in international deliberations, he replied in English, “ he really was not apprised of the situation. "
Then went on to say in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is great, I can hear what is happening outside."
Noted that depends on the perspective of each define whether progress was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and from different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
The data from a test revealed persistent racial disparities
The federal card ratings last week on the performance in mathematics, was a very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the systems with better performance of the country, the report card showed that students in fourth and eighth grade gave strides at a pace faster over the past two years, with regard to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains etched in the recent figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap in attainment between pupils African American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores for white students in fourth grade of the D.C. during the past two years, grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their peers African-Americans grew by only three points, 209-212.
In fact, the difference in yield grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in the eighth grade remained essentially flat, dropping a statistically insignificant, 245-244.
The average scores of whites were not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not quite large.
Along one stretch of six years, the picture is no more encouraging.
The gap between black and white students in fourth grade in 2003, when it released the first ENPE in the District, was 60 points of the scale (262-202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been barely decreased to 58.
Some lawyers of education in the District expressed concern in the past week, since progress held by the Vice Chancellor Michelle A. The see J.L. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Christian), were driven in large part by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole in response to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and divisive, said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the District.
I am not giving of rejoicing by a margin of two or three points, said the Council member of the D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-Por accumulation), who has a daughter at the fourth-grade Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of see J.L. Rhee, said that the message of the scores of proof is that secondary schools in the city are in desperate need of attention.
Clearly is always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But the concern is that we are not spending neither the time nor the energy needed for our middle schools.
See J.L. Rhee said that the District needs to find better ways to address the needs of students from low performance.
This autumn, for example, is training to some teachers to use a new curriculum of reading, the Reading System Wilson, targeting students in the upper grades of the primary and middle school, which dominated the basics of reading, early in their school years, and they are significantly behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a math curricula from kindergarten through sixth grade, which emphasizes games and real-life experiences, which was introduced in the District under the former superintendent Clifford Janey, for which she credits some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
But I think that we need to continue working to offer the best speeches to those students who are below the level of degree, expressed see J.L. Rhee.
Others say that the results of the ENPE highlighted the issue of whether see J.L. Rhee could further increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources to low-performing schools, which will be needed to reduce the difference.
Here there is a kind of lurid dilemma for Michelle see J.L. Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of mainstream politics is to devote its resources and reforms of the administration to schools located in the poorer sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate political implications that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban school superintendents, she is clinging to the middle class white and black.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, to have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the difference in performance is extending the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with independent schools.
We must reach nearly 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of their teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which it regards as an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
To make higher education a part of any future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong are exhausted.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years, fell and Blinked during a time before the white columns, brick facades and emerald pastures.
The parents of Graciela barely graduated in a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, which was born in Silver Spring and live in Riverdale, had never set foot in a campus.
Yet, when she and the other students in eighth grade of the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs 38.690 dollars a year, their attitude was less than impressed that the guests of enthusiastic students potential.
Yes! Here is where I am! She exclaimed Graciela, whom he would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the building of science.
My goodness me, was seriously?, said pensativamente, when the guide talked about the low proportion teacher-student school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited during his three-day trip, and had already absorbed completely its deliberate message: The question is not whether you go to university.
The question is to what.
Although there is growing concern about the high number of children born in the United States of immigrant Hispanics who drop out of high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who enter the college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these Hispanic "second-generation" is graded at university, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finish secondary school.
Its success stories are important, the researchers say, because it shows the way to a generation that will play a major role in the country's workforce.
Those who look to higher-yielding say that often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But the mentorship programmes can also play a unique role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to go to university, particularly if the efforts are sustained over time.
Noting to low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has studied to students Latino.
We have to think about providing a network of support for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal programme that funded the tour of the universities of Graciela is a useful example.
Known as Gear up, provides more than $300 million per year to the local school systems, to implement the programmes of university education, which start when they are low-income students in the middle school and going on to finish secondary school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent visiting the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry has reached agreements with foreign oil companies 10
Despite the concerns by violence and political instability, the Iraqi government failed to attract major oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure, for two auctions, which ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Ministry of Oil hit with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and the European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in the restoration of the oil industry of Iraq, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies walked away having pujado in only two of the 10 sites auctioned.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who presented an offer lost.
Two American companies reached agreements to deposits auctioned in June.
The poor representation of the American oil giants in the opening of the oil industry of Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asians and Europeans at the helm, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a think news online.
It will be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as long as the U.S. military withdraws, probably prevented the American oil companies risk more forcefully in Iraq, which has the third largest oil reserves in the world, said analysts.
American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because the rivals, including Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government, have significantly lower labour costs and are more prone to take risks because they do not answer to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that have reached agreements with the ministry.
The main US firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have deepened ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, in contracts during more than any other company and achieved major investments in contracts for two main deposits.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic power and technology, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Petroleum Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company would be on a par with their competitors and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
Companies shortlisted to submit proposals made offers that were then presented with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to boost production above current levels in each reservoir.
The chief planner of al-Qaeda has been apparently murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a suspected US missile attack in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a top al Qaeda operations planner of this week, said on Friday American counterterrorism officials.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a senior terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of only two Arab men are thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to sources of American and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unidentified aircraft, operated by the CIA inside the lawless tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading in the direction of the Afghan border, where the car was hit, said an official from the civilian intelligence agency of Pakistan, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
The official said that local militants suspected have rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "bodies totally smitten."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two American counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-level military planner of al Qaeda, who led the operations of the terrorist group outside the region of Afghanistan-Pakistan.
Was devoted to conspire around the world, said one senior official, who spoke anonymously, citing the sensitive nature of the American air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
Had a strategic guidance from the senior command of al-Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second US official said that Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaeda and was well-connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a household name for some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat that we raised with us and our allies, said the second official.
If confirmed his death, Somali would be the second leader of al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking officers.
The pace of attacks by pilotless aircraft operated by the CIA has declined since the summer, from an average of approximately six transactions per month to two, according to a count by The Long War Journal, a Web site run by a non-profit organization.
The decline can be blamed on a tactic improved by terrorist groups, that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly to kill suspected informers, said the site.
The top UN envoy in Kabul about to surrender
The top United Nations envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down from his post in March, ending with a tumultuous tenure was marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential election in Afghanistan, backed by the UN.
The departure of Mr. Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase, but is concerned that the timetable for the withdrawal of American military begins in 18 months lead other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the development of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so that they can rely on the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The compromise has to be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed for the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, to work with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector needs to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said that he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, spending only two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted to notify the Secretary
General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, so they have time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, it had a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to search for a replacement, according to officials of the UN.
Officials say they have been looking to Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish citizen-Italian wrote recently that the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was tested before his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September to promote the president Hamid Karzai at the presidential vote in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was sacked, "certainly undermined the mission, because there was as much scepticism regarding the international interference" in the election.
Eide said that proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate aid efforts by the forces led by the United States in Afghanistan.
It also prompted the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to recruit more staff from the United States and other Western countries, which are provided to the Afghan mission, saying that it would increase its confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide voiced frustration at the limited their powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the regulations cumbersome hiring of the UN undermined its ability to attract talent.
So it is that the rules of the UN enabled me to recruit only to one person since May, said.
That is catastrophic and could not continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will impose early "significant additional sanctions" against Iran for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a trip to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, he shrugged off the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to the question of a soldier on the probability of such an event.
One of the things that worries me is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian people in general.
He argued that it would be necessary to "a package of incentives and disincentives," "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less safe with nuclear weapons," because "its people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face consequences “ credible ” if its nuclear programme is not fully respecting the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, indicated that he would return to negotiating on the restriction of its nuclear programme and agree to make a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has lobbied for such an agreement, as a way of building trust between the two sides and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have moved away from tentative agreements, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided in connection with the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I think the hardening of Iran with the international community on some proposals that actually accepted at the beginning of October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a deadline of 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethink other options, including continue with what the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called a "devastating sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations on Thursday denounced what he called "baseless accusations and baseless ”, on the part of some members of the Security Council about the nuclear activities of Iran, and said that it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers," in order to achieve an appropriate solution in the long term. "
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, was found in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish region of Iraq's oil wealth, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and the Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to the borders, the rights of ownership and partnership.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to avoid any delay in projects in the United States, to reduce the number of American troops 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease the Kurdish anxiety about reducing outstanding. The American officials cited the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, the president of the regional government of kurdistan: "We will preserve its security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
Do not abandon them. "
In a China that is ageing, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that the sermoneaban on the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to care for more children ” and “ a baby but means a grave more."
The lesson learned so well that, when government officials in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and ageing population of his home town, abruptly changed tack this summer and began to provide incentives for young couples to have more than one child, her reaction was instant and firm: In any way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing to a second, said Wang, age 31, a manager of human resources with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children notoriously rechonchos, children only spoiled, warmly apodados "little emperors", is emerging a demographic crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six when the policy took effect, according to the Division
Demographically, the UN, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and above will explode from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is well above the global average of around 20%.
The imbalance is worse in affluent coastal cities with populations of highly educated, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one-child-per-couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Family Planning Commission and Shanghai Municipal Population, has said that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of aging people and alleviate a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not so rich, however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Drafted in the country's constitution in 1978, the one-child policy of China is perhaps the most controversial mandate introduced so far by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times his annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid a critical pressure over their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have made abortions depending on the sex of the fetus, leading to a high innatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, officials have demographic gradually softening its stance on the policy of only son.
In 2004, allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are only children, and in 2007, eased many of its hard-line slogans.
QIAO Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said that the central government officials have been debating recently even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is only son.
In July, Shanghai, became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight the morning, posters instructing families have one child, were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be best to have a second child and apply for a permit.
The city government sent to family planning officials and volunteers to visit to couples in their houses and slipping leaflets under doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been overwhelming very little.
A disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai complaining that noted a moderate increase in applications for couples who want a second child following the launch of the campaign, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five requests per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, yet it is expected that the number of births in the town in 2010 only reach about $165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, chairman of the committee's family planning municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give them the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But as many Chinese, have only the inadequate medical and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West sees misidentified the policy of only son as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yes, we are stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
Is the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the manager of human resources, said that he wants a single child because she was: "We were at the centre of our family and we have become accustomed to caring for all of us.
We are not accustomed to care for others, and we do not really want to care for others. "
Chen Zijian, 42, the owner of an agency of translations, as explained in a more forceful.
For parents with two races, middle-class, to reduce the birth rate, he said, is to have sufficient success to be selfish.
People aged between 20 and 30 grew up watching the fight of his parents during the first days of the experiment of China with capitalism and do not want this kind of life for them, said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time for parents, he argued.
A mother has to give up at least two years of their social life.
Then there are issues of space, "they have to reshape his apartment," and the strategic 'must have a curriculum prepared for the best care if a child is 9 months. "
Most of his friends are ready to face this once, said Chen, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
A group of the UN outlined a plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the UN, marked so far by offensive positions and mutual recrimination, attracted renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that provides for ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations who carry on their shoulders the bulk of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step in the negotiations, which is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders who would come to Copenhagen next week.
Developed by an ad hoc working group of the UN, the text does not talk about how much money would nod from rich to poor countries to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how the developed economies and major emerging economies recortarían its production of coal, and what would be the limit of the overall increase in temperature that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the document of six pages, summed up a negotiating text of 180 pages to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture."
Sample profiles for a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations recortarían collectively their emissions for 2020 between 25% and 45%, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, the countries recortarían emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also stimulated the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, since the floods and droughts to deforestation.
Nevertheless, on Friday, was filed the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week.
The US special climate envoy, Todd Stern, rejected the assertions that call for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with volunteers from the major emerging economies, if they are not funded by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China, with respect to what the Bush administration officials only two years ago.
The United States is not going to do a deal without the major developing countries to move forward and take action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese vice foreign minister He Yafei, said that the top US climate negotiator lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to deal with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the major powers of the world at stake, the fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, such as between the industrial and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies such as to save the planet, with China and the United States face on their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the twenty-four countries of the world are ignoring the most influential scientific imperative to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, he said that it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing about who should pay for the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to restrain the big emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where there is a new economic hegemony, argued Ulate, who also works as a regional councillor on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that the talks will be at best a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, drew up a proposal for a 24-page preliminary treaty early on the morning of Friday.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the thrust of the small island nations has "put political pressure on the political process as a whole," in part because they are now consolidated and demand action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government come to close a deal.
High-level officials, as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh, and the Chinese vice minister, dropped from aircraft and rushed to the corridors of Bella Center, in closed-door meetings and press conferences, in order to determine the demands which will be taken during the next week.
The complete mess of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people come in and out of the centre of convention, activists who play the guitar present performances at night making a mockery of the countries that they are selling, and they spend preliminary proposals from hand to hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
Intensity only constructs: Almost all of the key ministers are here at the moment, and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for global policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train to 203 kmh of Great Britain redefines that sentiment on Monday
To 5.13 on Monday morning, a trial whistle perforará darkness to point to a way out of the train which marks a revolution in travel in Britain.
The first high-speed intercity train the country will reach 225 kmh, when it came as a bolt from Ashford, Kent, to the station St Panrcas in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, to be joined by then the Dame Kelly Holmes, aboard the first intercity service Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service connects finally to Britain to an international network of fast trains, reliable and connects large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, times of business trips would be shortened and change of planes and cars to rail would reduce domestic emissions of coal, as well as easing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, they could still dampen the high-speed lines in Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company formed in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will present his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times, he learned.
This will give him a detailed road map for the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be laid out within a radius of five metres in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact is likely to be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be fleshed out within a radius of 25 metres from a definitive map.
It is also hoped that HS2 establish three options for a high-speed network broader than they head north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The favoured option currently being proposed is a configuration with form of Y, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch that is heading west from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another in the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would come to Scotland.
“ It appears that this option would be more beneficial, "said one member of the railways.
Once completed, journey times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tranche, which did not become operational by 2025, it would allow passengers travelling between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with a little more than an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 kmh, turning the British network in the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to withstand trains 400 mt of length, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate each hour in a line of London-Birmingham.
This means that there would be a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the restrictions of area of the capital, is expected to expand an existing station to conform to the high-speed network.
Industry experts argue that only the railway station St Mr. Pancras International or Euston offer that potential.
Lord Adonis announced whether he believes that the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that there will not be a final decision until after a general election.
Even if launches the work, the network would have to be constructed in sections.
Initially it would force trains to make quick lines by the existing lanes north of Birmingham, maintaining the journey times between London and Scotland over the next three hours.
This is viewed as a crucial point needed to ensure a change of planes to trains, a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers are faced with the mortgage for a Naranjal of £75,000 a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman of the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of a Naranjal who built the house in her constituency.
The spokesman of prisons in the party, which was downgraded by David Cameron after complaining that MPs were living on “ rations ”, increased their mortgage by £75,000 to build an extension framed by oak at their second home in Rutland.
She was allowed to charge to the taxpayer extra interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The authorities in the House of Commons approved applications at the time and had not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is leading a review of expenses of Members. Last night, Mr Duncan said that requests “ could not have been clearer or more simple. "
Mr Duncan, one of the Members of Parliament richer, has a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office agreed with Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year added a greenhouse in the house, described both as a "Naranjal."
Neighbors described it as “ a hothouse for entertainment. "
He was not asked Mr Duncan to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on their previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £271.406 owned in London at the home of his constituency, which he bought in 1991, the previous year to become a Member of Parliament.
The documents published this week showed that Mr Duncan was seeking about £1,400 a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications surged to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate on the mortgage of the Royal Bank of Scotland by Mr Duncan not changed in that time, suggesting that any increase would fund the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable mortgage rate fell from the BRE 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, the rate that is now.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr Duncan was asking for £1,250 per month in the month of May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as chairman of the opposition in the House in September, after a reporter disguised as filmed by saying that MPs were forced to survive "on rations" after the expenses scandal.
“ Basically, this is being nationalised, you have to live on rations and are treated like m * * GDR. "
He said: “ spending my money in my garden and I call a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And could ask for much more, but I am not. "
The Member, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was questioned in the first place on their expenses in May, when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the office of wages that this “ could be considered excessive ".
An activist dug a hole in the form of the symbol of the pound sterling on the lawn of Mr Duncan in protest, after revealing that requested £4,000 over three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr Duncan said: “ It was for major improvements, adopted both by the office of wages and subsequently by Legg. "
He added: “ We are trying to evade and commit crimes or infrinjir rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not be any clearer or more simple. "
Come those who have faith, to see the timetable of the Coming of the Palapa of the beach in Brighton.
The Brighton palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in a calendar of the Coming interactive.
In addition, a religious group that encourages alternative spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each day of December, using villancicos as its theme.
The event began on 1 December, with guests who could see the final Palapa since 5.30 until 6.30 every day, with pastelillos fillers and ponche supplied free of charge.
The villancicos elected until now include Vi Three Barcos, O Come, O Come, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the Palapa introduced the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, an assistant marketing of TV of Hove, is an unpaid clergyman in the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of beyond.
He said: “ We want that religion is more relevant to the people, in a post-Christian society. "
"Why we hope we as a church that people come to an old building strange? I believe that the Church should come to the public and hold in exciting ways.
“ The idea of the calendar of the Coming of the Palapa began as a conversation with some friends at a dinner.
Brighton is a place incredibly creative and vibrant and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality. "
Late payments: Anger among the prison guards, is expected to take actions
The unions for prison guards convened Friday to a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end-of-year festivities, bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until eneropor budgetary reasons.
The Force Ouvrière union prison guards (second) asked the staff out of service to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning compared to prisons and "block" to report the theft of their assets.
The CGT union prisons (3) of the profession) summoned to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for achieving a massive mobilization," because labelled "disgraceful and unacceptable" failure to pay in December of 'overtime pay, bonuses nights, weekends and holidays "worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Union Federal Prison Autonomous (Ufap / Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization (...) in order to increase the discontent and anger".
The Directorate of the Prison Service and the Ministry of Justice explained that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but claim that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Foreign Ministry reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of guards by guaranteeing that the payment would be made in the next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the operation and the modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Bureau of Prison Administration immediately implement a series of measures designed to this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of overtime would not recur in the future.
The pay of December will then be limited, except for the staff of the direction which enjoys the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and that "always blames budgetary constraints," deplored the Ufap / Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said outraged the interregional FO union of Marseille, announcing his decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocaciones."
The staff will come not to work on Sundays and holidays for the month of October if they are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the moment that we increase the tasks and missions without taking more effective, it is more than regrettable daring to attack the salary of staff, believes the CGT prisons of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, not in all regions is the same thing, because some are more fortunate than others.
But either way, the result is not expected, said the secretary-general of the Ufap, Jean-Francois Forget.

According to him, the judge Rittenband (deceased) have since talked with a prosecutor that would have commented that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before sentencing, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and wished) of the very mouth of the prosecutor, David Wells.
But in the end, Wells said at the end of September having “ lied ” to the author of the documentary.

The news about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," he assured her son David on Friday, when he arrived at the airport in Los Angeles to accompany his father, hospitalized for several days.
The news are very positive.
Daddy is strong and everything is going very well, told the press David Hallyday to step off the plane which brought in Paris shortly after the 13 (h local (21 h GMT).
The son of the singer, relaxed, said he would move "quickly" to the hospital Cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday began on Monday by an infection stemming from a discal hernia operation last November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of convenience, to avoid suffers so as to be able to administer their treatment," reported the Press Service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors from the hospital Cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday by an infection, the sequel to a discal hernia operation on 26 November last in Paris.
The singer was operated on again the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the Lycée Français de Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness an act of school, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The head of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatología the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel on Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer accused of violently to Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, neurocirujano that operated the singer on 26 November at the international private clinic Monceau Park, in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, declared Camus.
There is talk of a possible demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "gone too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly with the doctor and I was surprised when I was told that there was no problem in making the journey, because I was operated on twice-discal hernia, he added.
Shortly before the broadcaster RTL, indicated that it would appear that the singer had “ gone without team, without anything, "after his operation of Paris.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
Operated at the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a nursing home in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, also intervened to actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of a brain haemorrhage.
It is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted for justice on several occasions by malapraxis, as also for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Issuing, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "a man without scruples" defendant "regular" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from desirable."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday, through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the speech "was done without any problem," and that the results of the studies postoperatorios were "normal".
The operation "could not provocarhemorragias and thus needed no drainage," he added.
Either way, the tour of the singer, whose health problems are multiplied since the summer, entered into a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, to return to the tour on 8 January (in Amiens NDLR) as planned, I think it is very risky, declared Camus.

They also believe right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the + Nouveau focus +, and the slogan + l UDF d 'aujourd'hui + in its militant material and in the home page of its Web site, argue the signatories of the letter.
As we know, have no right to use the acronym, explains the office of the UDF that requires that the NC withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF all support, as well as of (his) website."
Also requests Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of (the) marks the legitimate heirs."
Failure to do so, they will return to court to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In the letter, require that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978," and remember that Morin and his friends' elected 'leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as they had done so in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the New Center is not, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, is continuing the room, "when he registered the trademark", it was no longer "member of the UDF from three years ago," but of the UMP.
Takes scandalously rigged and the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do so on their own.
This indiscretion is being transformed into crime, the report before making a mockery of the strategy of AS: "We believe that in politics, as in life, there is a more dignified made his own name to try to break the anonymity taking fraudulently a name that is not right."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged by abuse of weakness
This Friday the Nanterre tribunal decided to prosecute the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as stated by the daughter of the multi-million-dollar Liliane Bettencourt, took advantage of a state of weakness of the 80-year-old expoliarla for a share of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offence for which the penalty is a maximum penalty of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fines.
This means that, in this case, there will be a credible process of a saga on one of the richest families of France, in which a mother and daughter they squabble over the reins of L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the Tribunal Correctionnel No 15 also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, was subjected to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir, principal shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such tests, even more in the conditions proposed by the Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors designated this Friday should bring a report by 10 March 2010 in which must be in place if Liliane Bettencourt suffered states of weakness and over what period.
I believe that it will accept.
I am going to speak with her, said the lawyer for Ms Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman, to leave the audience.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Issuing, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news … The survey will show that he (Banier) manipulated to this old lady, whom we must protect, he said.
Two years ago, the only child of Liliane Bettencourt initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing them of being tapped for years of the weakness of his mother to raise one billion euros in grants, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, who was a friend of long standing.
On Friday, while the court considered whether the action brought by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, arguments from lawyers were, in some cases, a large family confession.
In this way, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters that his client send (1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which he said that had little faith by the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of the year 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "I could explain to my daughter that she wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for 15 years.
Since their wedding, I could never again go back to speak with Françoise. "
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to appear, so much so that a judge of Wards refused, in recent days, to grant his request to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to face justice, it was not under the tutelage and has no guardian.
No other person may appear in their place, "said the representative of the Public Prosecutor Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that would rule once the trial on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers.
Does managerial Revolution or order of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of big French companies, our fight for the development of the intelligence of business will have been in vain....
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalled the position of companies with regard to consumers before the revolution of marketing: It is that the partners adhere to "values" selected from above as quickly sought to impose on the consumer products designed by the technical factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution of marketing gave him his place to the strategies of conquest of the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to the factors of preference for customers is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end up in a deadly demoralisation.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects the executives.
This demobilization committed a grave development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially of R & D and, even more, the intelligence of business.
Indeed, the Business Intelligence (BI) "demands that all parties involved (...) behave in a proactive and a forward-looking vision ”; it needs by employees a compromise that is totally opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For that reason, we convened a managerial revolution, which would be to put the team in the heart of the concerns of the company as the customer.
Opinion polls have a relative utility internal
Did The domestic opinion polls, as the survey, conducted by Orange among its employees, will encourage the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I fear that not.
In principle, because I was able to verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many twists and turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what always made! B989
In the second place, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, is growing in proportion to the importance of their own failures.
- last, because the majority of managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from major schools of engineers, interpret the psychology mechanistically.
Take, for convenience intellectual, the former behavioral theory that "neuroscience" Americans recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely disseminated behind their backs.
In this way, to suggest that it is possible to handle the "commando" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent investigation by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms to managers in a management position mechanistic, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization
On the contrary, the managerial revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, means taking a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating throughout reasoning or practice of corporate governance, a fundamental fact: For employees, the commitment to the company is possible only if they show up clearly as a means to realize some of his dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only the studies from the Analysis Motifuncional adopt this conception of the motivations of employees.
The studies showed that they judge his company based on a predetermined doxa that enables them, through the image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own projects of life.
Thanks to the identification and to the measurement of the factors of mobilization, the managers of businesses are able to monitor, forecast and anticipate its "social performance" and reposition the management derecursos human "in the place."
In this way, create a breeding ground for the development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo discourse: By the "just war," Obama receives praise from the Right
This Friday, the American right-wing, happy that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed the speech that Obama had spoken on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the prize to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential address, like Sarah Palin, the former vice-presidential candidate for the 2008 elections.
I loved what he said, declared Mrs Palin, a leading figure of the right wing of the Republican Party to the newspaper USA Today, and added that she had addressed the issue of the war ” is sometimes necessary "in his recently published memoirs.
In my view, the war is, of course, the last thing that the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists, he noted.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and in Afghanistan, was devoted, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich's, found that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was very well, was happy the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which had appreciated in particular mention of “ the existence of evil in the world, "in the words of presidential.
At times, the speech I felt very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview with the radio program “ The Takeaway. "
The former elected representative, which is regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential elections in 2012, was pleased to hear from "a president of the left" when reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could deliver a prize of peace if the use of force did not exist ”.
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George W. Bush and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a speech very American."
In addition to stand as a "citizen of the world," as "always does," "spoke as an American president" to remind the Europeans' living in a security bubble that they did not create and cannot do much to preserve it, "said Gerson.
Among the few right not very convinced, a hawk in the era of Bush, the former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and lacking in inspiration" on the Internet site of National Review Online.
To the left of the president, the representative Democrat Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent, he warned.
However, the press centre-left praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, although continues to believe that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, described his speech "overproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo discourse "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," commented excited the Californian newspaper.
"Obama delivered the speech that was necessary," said the New York Times, judged "at a time of sombre and uplifting."
Road transport: Three marathon negotiations in order to ensure the supply of Christmas
After three marathon negotiating session, public-sector unions of roads and the TLF Transport and Logistics (France), the only organization employers who stayed until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon at an agreement that puts an end to the locker to strike and the threat that falls on the supply of Christmas.
During the meeting of signatures on Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "happy" with the agreement, after several negotiating sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators they parted at dawn on Friday, in the hope of quickly signing the text of the agreement at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) left by the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 o h was necessary for all agree and the text is firm to the 18 (h).
The conflict "has been very damaging for business" and "it was feared that disturbs the New Year celebrations," he declared Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in the road transport, local and regional), and 2.9 per cent for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises of 8.72 €9.06 for low wages.
It is not much, but we start with great disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we are going to give the order to our militants that there are no further cuts or blockades in the centres of supply.
But can always be some rebel dissenting opinion, he added.
Philippe Grillot, chairman of the TLF, acknowledged that it is “ a good deal ”, even if it was "difficult to grant increases to higher wages, bearing in mind international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and respects to employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) is recognized as a "historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in the cost of travel of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will mainly deal with the subject of extra payment and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that “ a low of 100 million euros in charges employers' was the subject of an amendment to the government in the bill amending finance for 2009, which the National Assembly voted Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms."
The signing of TLF allows that the agreement is implemented, firstly, to businesses stuck to this organization and, secondly, for the entire profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour made for an extension.
It will be "as soon as possible," Bussereau assured.
The opposition of employers' organisations could only delay the process.
The FNTR complained that it was a “ business of naive, "because the 100 million euros" had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax. "
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as close to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to antagonise those who want to eat the turkey in the forthcoming Christmas Eve dinner, it regretted the Unostra.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months."
RER A: Conflicts over the weekend, unions objecting to the proposals for the RATP
The conflicts in the RER A, the largest urban public transport in France, they are going to continue over the weekend, because at Friday's meeting, 2nd day of strike between unions and the management of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with regard to their request for premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday only move trains between the 10 (h), and the 20 (h, at a rate of a train out of two in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and a train out of four in the other lines.
The interconnection with the Préfecture SNFC will be suspended at Nanterre, which will force passengers to change their train.
The Galerías Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, were happy "the RATP strive to provide service to the big tent."
The RER A crosses from west to east of the city of Paris.
The stretch RATP tours from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre until Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-la-Vallée.
This Friday, roughly one in two trains circulated at rush hour, and almost no train in hours valley, as had been expected.
On Thursday, there was no disorder in the terraced thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Isle of France.
In this way, at the dawn, the season of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially by the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained that it had been lifted, "an hour-and-a-half hours earlier to reach".
The station, Saint-Lazare is not saturó, indicated the SNCF, which had planned the supervision of police and law enforcement agencies.
The RER A operating the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or into arrived or departed from the station, Saint-Lazare to join the metres.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. Analysed the results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, a meeting that took place with the management on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER A: Working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what they want drivers who demand a premium owed to them, according to Thierry Garon (south).
The RATP puts even in parentheses its proposals for premium, commented outraged the CGT, noting that the guidance ” was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and roads had already been resolved. "
It is expected a further meeting on Monday to make "a longer analysis on the conditions for the exercise of the profession," added the RATP.
It also led to the unions to say that the company "did not cared for users of the weekend."
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the leadership, which he refused until then to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could spread to the RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa-indépendants have filed a notice.
The unions are calling for a premium of EUR 120 to 150 euros (Unsa), of which EUR 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, indépendants) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions in this line with a million passengers a day.
The drivers of RER, all in the second stage of its career, charge of 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros in bonuses, for hours with alternating shifts weekends and holidays.
The Turkish judicial prokurdo dissolved the ruling party, a decision with serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday in favor of the dissolution of the main party prokurdo of the country, a decision that immediately provoked anger in the Kurdish community, in the east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of government, which has just lend a hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become "hotbed of activities that undermined the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," he declared to the press, the president of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, though only required a majority of seven votes to get the dissolution, indicated Kiliç, and added that 37 of the leaders of the party, including its chairman Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity which enjoyed Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the property of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that they would quit Members of Parliament before being parliamentarians without party label.
The decision comes in the wake of a procedure that launched the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accused the DTP of obeying the “ principles ” of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the rebels of the PKK.
However, the party claims that it has "organic ties" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court intervenes at the time the government it extends a hand to the Kurdish community offering her a series of measures to strengthen their rights for the Kurds will support the PKK, in order to put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP claimed that a break-up could lead to an escalation of tensions in the Southeast Anatolian, which was where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of the detention of the PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan, degenerated into clashes with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the main city in South-East populated mostly by Kurds.
The Disciplined Forces threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while the protesters threw Molotov cocktails and stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, also concentrated around a hundred people.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the court decision would "deepen the despondency".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish NDLR) dissolving a party, told the newspaper.
The government, which was formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
In principle, we are opposed to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, declared the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision boycotts completely the democratic opening launched by the government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction by the PKK, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack which killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the North of Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks of the past few months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, was seen as a secret city, inaccessible to the Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the 10 districts in Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site to secret investigations of weaponry.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located at 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is regarded as the "Silicon Valley Russian".
Here are important research centres and production of micro- and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the headquarters of scientific Riedberg in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and companies of the Centre for Innovation in Frankfurt (FIZ).
There were a number of mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, and in Frankfurt Selenogrado Riedberg signed a “ Protocol of close collaboration ".
The Vice-Mayor and Moscow Mayor Yuri Rosljak Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed by the head of planning services, Edwin we commend.
In the 2010 will travel to a seminar in the FIZ Selenogrado representatives and managers of small and medium-sized enterprises of the research centre of natural sciences.
The scientific exchange
It is a scientific exchange continued.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The companies the FIZ will have the possibility of putting one foot in the Russian market growing.
In return businesses wanted to have access to Russian scientific contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of major companies and research institutes Russians.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Technology Electronics, the large combines Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called “ City of socialist planning "for the investigation of military hardware.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "green City") was named the landscape of forested mountains, which settled research facilities.
Checks of Stuttgart
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not sufficiently high places for nothing.
Supporters of the project is purely and simply as “ the new heart of Europe ".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, rather than a monstrous construction project, which bring to the regional capital of Banden-Württemberga a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980's.
With rail terminals, which end up in the middle of the city, were at that time fossils of engineering of the nineteenth century, acting as checks of a modern rail traffic, because formerly required an enormous amount of time to enganchar locomotives back ahead.
Rolling, stopped in their tracks to continue the journey; but it should be done.
And that is why should disappear terminals: In Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: A season of passage, which is about half of the journey of the trans-European lines between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe."
The S21 really will be launched, despite the fact that the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Bavarian capital hessiana and is almost unpayable implement the reduction.
Railway terminals, of course, there are more problems of entry and exit, since there are locomotives reversible with unity tractora and cart driver at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21, including the new tranche built ICE towards Ulm already will be initiated.
Federal and local politicians have prepared as well.
The railway tracks, also because the risks of large individual projects in the infrastructure of the Republic is the taxpayer, not the state.
From the point of view of houses, the project is still justified to some extent.
It creates new urban space, with many green areas, probably of the computer-generated by the graphic designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The season of step and the logic of roads are designed for the transport of persons, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time, did not competition from low-cost flights.
But the politics of modern transport must first work to strengthen the transport of goods, as rail transport is considerably more ecological that made by lorries on the roads.
However, the new tranches in construction, we are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is the fact that the S21 also indirectly affect many other projects of rail.
More than six billion euros should be buried in the Pontifical.
That is the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between ten and fifteen thousand million.
It is certain that within the next decade will lack the money in other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
In total sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transportation.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 miles of rails long through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, is built the route at a slow pace.
It is urgent that we here step on the accelerator properly.
However the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international carriage of goods: Through the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport.
The federal government is still pending in the federal parliament in Wiesbaden, whether to lodge an appeal against the judgement on the prohibition of night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The coalition of CDU / FDP appears to have commissioned experts legal research of the judgment of the VGH, more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had informed in writing on this date, which in the case of the construction of the runway west planned at the Frankfurt airport, the state would have to re-regulate the prohibition of night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and the 5 a.m., as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the legal protection of the population of noise due to air transit.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, if it is going to lodge an appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured the representatives of the government for refusing to appeal to the Administrative Court of the nation in Leipzig.
The head of the group SPD, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect its promises to ban air traffic at night, who had carried out before the elections, otherwise it could be taken as a lack of floor.
It is quite difficult, if you let him keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We keep our word."
The Minister Posch rejected the admonishing Schäfer-Gümbel, that the federal government would be trying to through misrepresentation of the right and tricks still get their night flights.
A comprehensive legal research would need some time.
The coalition did not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a decision legally watertight, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As well as it represents the opposition, they would not have never been claims his group on the prohibition of night air traffic.
Banks in the US returned aids.
The big American banks hit by the crisis was stripped of their shackles.
"Bank of America" returned at once the subsidies that he had paid the bank rescue fund Tarp out of a total of $45 billion (approximately $30 million euros).
And also the group Citi plans to repay state aid, according to a report on CNBC in the United States.
With this, the institutes are seeking to free themselves from restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation in the payment of the bonus to managers, as well as the payment of high rates.
"Bank of America" had secured about 19 billion of cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the amount the took the box, which had a number of ways, including by the sale of items.
The bank director Kenneth Lewis acknowledged on Wednesday night, especially American taxpayers: The financial injection helped to overcome a very difficult time.
The bank house had miscalculated the effort of the takeover of the investment bank at the height of the financial crisis.
The group Citi also aims to get money in the capital market in order to be able to discharge its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported source of known circles, which the US bank could announce already for this Thursday, increased its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative of the group Citi declined to comment.
In June had already returned its aid, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Rapid election
In the end, it was all faster than previously thought.
Barely two weeks after the administrative council of the German television channel ZDF () pressures editor-in-chief of Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can submit to a successor.
Yesterday evening, the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the study principaldel ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of that from the station, officially so as not to pre-empt the proceedings.
But surely also had no further damage to the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal will not be adopted in the administrative board.
Frey, the candidate of Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet finalised the closure of drafting this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative council with his proposal to renew for another five-year term of the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against it. The dismissal of Brender bitter for Schächter was a failure, but a failure that could be expected.
For most of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated that they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the chairman of the government in Hesse, the Sr.Roland Koch.
Declined another mandate of the editor-in-chief of prestigious with the argument, which under the leadership of Brender news of ZDF would have lost audience ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which flageló political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, until they had interfered in the debate 35 specialists in public law, which rated the collecting of Koch as unconstitutional.
But it did not do anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance philology.
Having worked on the radio station “ Südwestfunk "and in the daily newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau."
In 1983, it was changed to the ZDF, in principle the informative "heute-journal."
Following seasons (1988 to 1990 rapporteur editor-in-chief of staff; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and driver of the morning programme "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001, director of the foreign policy of ZDF; since then, director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional complaint following the dismissal of Brender, which was elected even this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the magazine means "Medium Magazin."
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week that the Länder should change the state convention of the ZDF in such a way, that the proposals of the personnel director could not be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the guilds of control of ZDF was ruled out by Beck.
The likely successor to Brender, Peter Frey, recommended before the administrative council with a clever twist: Strongly criticized the guild by the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to nominate him for the position of editor-in-chief of without losing face, such as the administrative council could vote, without falling back on suspicion of giving the post-partisan any such thing.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is awarded to the liberal left.
The university careers are clear
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder finally relented. In a meeting of the Ministers for Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve conditions of study at the undergraduate and masters.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, agreed to reduce the burden of reviews: Basically each module of the race is due to end with a single review.
In addition to examine the workload of students, and we want to ensure a "genuine and justifiable action."
Politics and the universities want to simplify further the recognition of the results of examinations between the Universities inside and outside Germany.
The Länder are committed to establish more flexible rules set for structural racing Bachelor and master.
Regulations of the Länder that diverge from that, should no longer exist.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the presidents of universities spoken continuously improving undertake and complete a successful career (estudiabilidad).
Now, for the first time there was talk of a content in particular.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of reviews: "Each module ends with only one consideration," it said in a 30-page document, which aims to regulate partly by the adoption of the university careers.
With "significant reduction in the burden of reviews" are intended to prevent the development in the wrong direction, which would significantly estudiabilidad, as well as explained the director of the council of accreditation, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in the future, "estudiabilidad" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and content should be examined thoroughly in terms of unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of..
The courses.
The students would have “ the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and promote their own initiative ".
These rules are free to resort to new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must be "reacreditar" once every five years. But that would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
The perpetrators of this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which was installed by the Länder.
The ministers of education and culture urged the Länder in October influence in such a manner in the agencies, that the number of subjects and the reviews are not too demanding and demanding.
In some Länder universities and technical schools already reached agreement with ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Platinada assured provide additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities must implement mentorship programmes and student counselling, as well as strengthen offices of reviews and from outside.
The Land and universities aim to dispose of 10 million euros for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of law at university level.
According to her should be enough only one consideration for the completion of a model of career.
The shape of the race should be made more flexible, it also wants to ensure the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitate the accessibility to master.
Until the end of next year is intended to examine all the races on its "estudiabilidad."
This Thursday, the government and the opposition discussed again on the conditions of study in the federal state.
Part of the praise there was also criticism about the decisions.
On the board at the federal level of the university groups Juso (Young Socialists seexigía), that the shape of education policy is no longer should be "behind closed doors" of the ministers and the university rectors.
No later than after strikes from education, now students as the main involved should have their say as well.
The chairman of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave their support to students: "We need the experience of the students," said on Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers for Education, with which the HRK deliberated on a document of the reform package.
For the union of education and science ((GEW) Bonn agreements were not quite enough: The union demands a legal right for each student with a bachelor's degree from the possibility of access to a career Masters later.
In addition to the Länder have to ensure that the current generation of students from Bachelor exist in a future enough places of study to master with the best possible position to study, as reported by a member of the (GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The Länder have quecontratar significantly more teachers.
But about greater access to the Masters, the Education Ministers did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"To get in and out of Germany is virtually unchecked," said the first line of a poem of lyrical Werner Söllner language destabilizing in fragments, which tematiza experiences of arrival in Germany experienced by a dissident, who won their freedom, but lost the environment of their language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a publisher of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
To Söllner gave him a number of prizes for literature, in 1993, provided the memorable lessons or spoke of poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since el2002 is director of the forum of literature in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Given that talk quite last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich on "German Literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror disfigured her Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read out a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian Securitate secret service in front of fellow writers Mark-Romanians, among others, Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In conjunction with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the Award of the German language.
Attempts to recruitment had started slowly, early in 1971.
"Therefore I am someone who does not adequately defended itself against attempts to provocation of fear of the Securitate," completed Söllner.
The lyrical Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller and his controversial literary without equal with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, it is shaking the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors from Romania in a case that illustrates the chasms and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, by what is known so far, is not just a perpetrator but a victim.
In his record of Securitate IM Walter had played a role, said the scientist Michael Markel literary after the confession of Söllner, and stressed the positive influence for him delIM Walter.
He had apologised or defended at all points difficult for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral imperative to make this statement," he said.
The statement of Söllner in this way and in the face of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, it is not surprising that much.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies of the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, wrote Herta Müller earlier in the month of July in the weekly “ Zeit ", having read his own record of 914 pages.
Those involved have surely speculated and will have known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also of Walter.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the deal with the files of control by the Securitate is still fairly wet.
A systematic clarification was boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the elucidation of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the authority Birthler, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of cases since then is rather dragged out.
Since 2005, there was a law governing the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller, evidence of the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview, a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the recipient.
"She is psychosis ”, in the end only interrogated once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, questions arise inevitable with the case Söllner, as so often when there is blame silent.
Why is this right now? What is caused damage? The calm reaction from listeners off the confession of Söllner leaves hoped that the continuation of this story will be guided more by the thrill of knowledge and not so much by the award of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the works of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, is more than a mere footnote.
The Champions League as garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the football team VfB Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a plastic bag of orange colour of the supplier of his team, boarded a taxi Mercedes Class C a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that a member of the foreign service elegantly dressed was emerging from a very nice Christmas celebration, in which the manufacturer of sports articles have shared samples.
The man in the characteristic baldness had hired a driver, owing to the fact that we still do not know the city.
Moreover, it would also have been able to drive the car himself: At the end of the day, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was intoxicated with joy the man in 55 years.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow would start work again.
Or would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the final eighth of", namely in the Champions League, thanks to triumph 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania, “ but we cannot allow ourselves to be blinded by the success: Brutally will have to fight against the drop. "
"Task much more important, “ I expected the next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the “ real classes "in everyday life in the league.
And to eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly shown again, after the rapid three goals of Marica (5), (8) and Träsch Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing of lots
The final eighth of Champions League matches (tripping on 16 / 17 and 23 / 24 February / matches 9 / 10 and 16 / 17 March) is sortearán on 18 December in Nyon.
So I remained limited the joy at the stunning entrance Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had inspired the bewildered profis Stuttgart confidence in themselves, willingness to surrender and appetite for the game.
I went with the players and told them that I had to focus on their strengths, I urged to be more fired, explained the repairer of souls Gross its recipe for success that sounds simple, but with the therapist Babbel already had not had the desired effect.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted the supporter of Babbel, Jens Lehmann, “ when in football there is a new impetus, sometimes things happen that had not been thought possible. "
Sami Khedira and, after a pause of several weeks due to an injury moved quickly to become the best player local thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the “ phenomenon ” earned with the proverbial “ wind ” and how to work the new boss: “ He is a man speaking in depth, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
And that is what has been missing, of course, when I was Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the sport Horst Heldt steering
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all record.
Like Gross, also the players and the manager refused to overestimate the triumph against a defence weakened by lack of relay and totally overshot of guests Romanians.
He also had won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0: 4 had reached the sad awakening, gave to think Khedira.
And the manager Horst Heldt warned that although it had reached a goal of the season, the other was still very far.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt had no appetite for in his birthday number 40, even after the first victory at its headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which returned to be updated in the form of a television interview, released just before the start of the game, which had granted the doorman Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions taken by others, and not Jens, Heldt faced harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had reproached weakness in the direction to the board of directors, which had decided to change their coach by the pressure of fanatics teenagers.
It also was removed his day off after games Lehmann described him as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Statements by Lehmann “ were marked by the pure selfishness, "he replied Heldt, and announced zaguero implications.
Probably will no longer be friends forever, the two cuarentones.
But at least agreed with all the others in that, without previous efforts with the team of the coach replaced, it would not have been possible to the spectacle of great strength of game and battle.
Babbel and their aides had had “ a significant part in the success, "said Heldt and Lehmann in unison; and also agreed the man in the suitcase of plastic.
Bout of the world championship heavyweights
Ardent duel in Bern: Time and again the challenging Kevin Johnsonn was causing the world champion Mr. Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough Rounds, Ukrainian defended its title of heavyweight in the version of the WBC.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Mr. Vitali Klitschko remains a world heavyweight champion.
The champion of 38 years in the version of the association WBC expired in the night from Friday to Saturday in Bern to American Kevin Johnson by a unanimous decision by points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko was his third successful defence of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to carry out the noqueo that everyone had hoped for.
Klitschko expanded its balance sheet to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice had to be overcome because of their injuries.
The challenging Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
Before some 17000 spectators at the Arena in Berne, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 metres, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 inches lower, than before the duel had proclaimed the end of an era Klitschko, was sidestepping again and again the blows of the world champion, as well as Klitschko was unable to move decisively to its target its dangerous skilful.
In general terms, liabilities Johnson did too little for a challenging, and only tried to move the Rounds.
While he was taunting Klitschko with words and gestures, their strokes only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, that he bore 12 Rounds complete with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenging had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
Had insulted Klitschko as “ horrible zombie ”, which “ does not know how to do anything. "
In undertaking the weighing, the champion was left to provoke on Friday to rob Johnson glasses of sun nose "in order to see their eyes."
Fourth triumph following the return of Klitschko
Also at its fourth row after their return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko was invincible.
After a break of nearly four years ago, defeated then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "their" of the WBC belt, which had previously had to surrender without a fight.
Later that year, defeated in their defence of the title to Juan Carlos Gomez, Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this fight only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his rapid return to the ring.
But his dream is still collect all of the four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of associations WBO and IBF.
However, the belt belonged to the Briton David Haye, after he destronó in November to Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 metres in height.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Mr. Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company which promotes is planning because the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium, London.
The case Kunduz
Frontal attack the opposition: The head of the group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, called liar to the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, due to false information on the subject Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left-wingers demand explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin – following the most recent revelations about the air strike in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), have cheated with knowledge of the facts.
In the news broadcast, "Tagesschau" on Saturday, transmitted by the television channel ARD, the head of the group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister “ knowingly had not told the truth "about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, usually said: He said lies.
The order to kill would have done without taking into account the rules of the International Protection troops for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that it had NATO, and that he had read Mr. Gutenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, had shown that in this attack not only sought to destroy the trucks hijacked, but also to intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the air attack by the United States, requested by a German commander in Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the report of the investigation of NATO, died or were injured up to 142 people.
The greens, the SPD and the Left had called on Saturday for the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to take action immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the federal government's policy on Afghanistan, and if the chancery, the army and the information service have adopted this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancery not exert any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, also had transcended misgivings about the presentation by the Ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the Spiegel, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely against the background of the attack on the convoy.
It is officially had said that they had denied the existence of the reports of NATO and the minister had concealed sensitive details.
However, since the environment of the two high-ranking officials, it transpired that they even had said the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report of a patrol of the area.
In the meantime, Wichert would have requested in a letter clarifying the matter, reports the newspaper 'Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung. "
So far it has not received a reply, it was said.
The ministry has not commented on Saturday, with regard to the criticism that has been made, and noted that the matter would be cleared up in the commission of inquiry from the Federal Parliament, which will form the next Wednesday.
Worlds oníricos
In a state of vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts fade the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
As it occurs during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are acostados in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can indulge without hindrance to the most wild imaginations and creations of the fantasy.
However, who experience similar statements to sleep during the vigil, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, it is considered the most modern in the Western world as a lunatic or a drug addict, or at least as manic.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or those under the influence of drugs.
The blame lies with our imagination: The same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, at times make a blurring the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality.
The states of consciousness oníricamente modified warning may appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases the call visions, and at worst madness.
Although it can distinguish the triggers and effects, it can refer to similar processes visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, experiences psicodélicas of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, states of possession chamánica, and hallucinations and psychosis.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when it has descarrillado the balance of the neural substances of communication in the brain – particularly the dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin and acetilcolina – and is disrupted the interaction between different parts of the same.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very frequently appear hallucinations complex thoughts and frenzied.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors from the former era.
Aristotle defined hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigilance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 "a close resemblance to the state of madness with states oníricos," to Sigmund Freud, the dream even was "a psychosis, with all the illogic, alocadas formations, and mirrors of it."
It was the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a figure of comic book.
His body is two dimensions and scandalously colourful.
The gravity no longer has power over him, is floating near the ceiling of the bedroom.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with muecas red as blood, deformed, rechinando teeth.
We are pursuing them, making themselves with heavy boots and flameantes, cast against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Voices shrill and malignant resonate from the walls and radio.
Can no longer withstand it, the voices that insult and offend.
Henning T. starts two cables from the stereo, the amarra to form a noose-hanging, and fixed on a hook on the roof.
You climb into a bocina and put the noose around his neck.
Jumping it.
The rope was rein.
What you will serve as a lesson!, shout the voices in a choir that he is dying the eardrums, “ God sees the clinic and do you heal! "
Now, Henning T. is 40 years and has undergone six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause of death was the LSD.
His diagnosis is esquizo-emotional-paranoid psychosis, is also maniaco-depressant, takes medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with the disease, for the past three years, is married.
In the psychosis I experienced the most terrible anguish and the depths of despair, he said.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population falls ill at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics treating her as the second commonest disease after the depression.
In a schizophrenic psychosis acute, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and fell into a state of anxiety that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, disruptions in the relationship, or persecutory ideation ”.
Especially spread is the hearing voices: Voices that give orders, say, or talk.
They are also frequent optical hallucinations.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish what is important and what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signs, awareness is awash with impressions.
As the dream, also the psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deep layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, said Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the hospital's general psychiatric teaching hospital of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of events, everything has a meaning addressed to him.
At the same time enters a passive role, as in a dream, is overwhelmed by events and cannot organise actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, wake up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life.
Unlike in a dream, said Fuchs, "the spatial structure and sensory perception of reality in the psychosis remain in principle as it."
The paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still a puzzle why our brains is unfortunate mishaps.
According to Mr. Fuchs, states of emergency can lead to any person to lose touch with reality on a provisional basis.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
Apparently there is a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that, in addition to those genes, there are also other determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer brain damage to a minimum.
We suspect that the neural maturity of the brain was affected at an early stage of development, for example through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explained Fuchs.
But it remains to be seen how this alteration of the neural system, which, moreover, is not obvious at all for many years.
Also, the influence of environment plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience may be the trigger psychosis when there is already a provision in advance.
Similarly, the hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, because they interfere with the system transmitter in the brain.
When the brain warms
The illogical of all this is that people suffering from hallucinations and psychotic with their take medicines very expensive to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the lecturer in psychology Erich Kasten, Lübeck.
The perceive a hallucination as pleasant or not often hinges on the point of view.
Kasten collects from ten years ago, reports of hallucinations and visions and has analysed the results in the book Die Welt im Kopf irreale unserem (The unreal world in our head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the accompanying the typical symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them are, together with mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and head injuries.
So surprising and under specific conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that normally are repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hiperactivas or poorly cohibidas; when our brains warms, but also when there are incentives.
The drugs can cause this state in the same way as the brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, the stress, the evil of loves brain or other states of exception.
In jüngeren STUDIEN gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens, einmal im Leben erlebt zu haben eine Halluzination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. did 16 years, lived in a small town of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attended a college of secondary education.
A girl.
If it were not for these images and voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a boy clumsy with long hair and dark he runs the floor.
When she replied, the other students watch it soprendidos; no one, part of it, heard or saw the boy.
They believe that the girl is a timid ensoñadora a bit odd, but Sarah K. you know that he was not dreaming.
It is surprising and sees and hears that boy, in the same way that sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next to me.
Can feel even his presence, at least a few moments ago.
It is a good feeling, I like the boy.
I sometimes wondered whether it is insane.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
Nightly, appearances are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When I was in class sometimes cannot continue the lesson because Professor – to their eyes and ears – is introducing a new partner, while for the rest explained so visible and audible in the mathematical equations.
Nightly, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to reach the dream, which often comes too late and is low, not able to tell whether it is surprising or dreaming, if the images we see, the muecas or the girl with bleeding cuts in arms and legs, appear in front of their eyes open or closed.
Leave me in peace, I cried to figures.
Their parents and friends have not been told anything, would believe that is insane.
The autumn of 2009. Sarah K. Have hoy20 years.
Adopted last year, selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago that hallucinations have disappeared.
Since he has come in contact through the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, knows that he is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is isolated socially or suffers a restriction of incentives, it is very likely that after a time begins to have hallucinations.
I believe that the brain is unoccupied yse charge the same sought entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, had little fear of the other children and often playing alone.
Their hallucinations began when, with 13 years, learned that the man known as Daddy since has taken the reason is not his biological father.
Since the acoustic and visual hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that process impressions real and noise, to those affected as Sarah K. Les find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Each experience," Kasten said, “ occurs in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, so look so real. "
Kasten also classifies the evening fantasies as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten recommends that his patients who cherish their hallucinations as a special skill.
Situation boundary between dream and hallucination
In this world too focused on what is aware, experiences imagined tend to generally patologizarse, said Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and medical clinic chief of the psychiatry and psychotherapy of the hospital-Florence Nightingale-Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a disease hard and painful, but that also involves something positive and creative – the madness is a masterpiece of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirismo, a special form of conscience, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
Hallucinations oníricas almost dreams are very complex and detailed than the person who undergoes feels real, and that subsequently could not differentiate the lie awake.
The states aware oníricos arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or illness, as for example in patients with polirradiculoneuropatía, experiencing a motor paralysis remain completely conscientes. die bei vollem Bewusstsein Eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or in the world owing to a motor disability total and permanent, it replaces a very dangerous situation, real and imagined himself for a world that is decoupled from reality.
A form of state boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation lingers in the imagination.
An intensively to give meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own creative ability allows us not sink into the blue of the loss of consciousness.
It is all right, even later in the memory
Also, the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, Zürich, described their experiences in his book Herzenwechsel oníricas as an effort to save the soul.
He was 49 years, when his conscience embarked on trips of several days after an operation of the cardiac valves with heart transplant included, while her body was sentenced to immobility in the season of intensive care.
Claussen descended into a world created by the same and visited places strangers in other times: Was lying in a bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot controlled their health.
It was in the early Middle Ages, surrounded by lofty that produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorbike was kidnapped in their country of origin, made surfing on his hospital bed in the Alps snowy firn and encountered a Mafioso Korean.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, it is all right, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these trips interioresson fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of the trips are mental, many years later, much clearer, even in the minor details.
More clear and intensive even that actual experiences.
The intensity of this experience spread the horizon of the rest of our life experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the oneirismo, psychosis, hallucinations and consumption of narcotic drugs show how fragile is the internal reproduction of reality outside, even when we are awake.
Each amendment to the state of awareness, sums up the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
It is an experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Crude
The children will take charge of the publisher with 27 years
The new editor Kallen has reached an interim solution: Hubert crude wants to leave your company in the future in the hands of his two sons, commented to Spiegel.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – The publisher Hubert crude sees his company in the hands of their children in the future.
The two sons become heirs with 27 years and have a strong will to enter the company, confirmed gross, 69 years, Spiegel.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
My next question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
One cannot put in front of 7,500 workers to their children, if they are not adequately trained for this.
That would put an end to the children, and also with the company.
Crude released on Thursday that he will retire from January the chair of the board and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed as his successor.
This family member Kallen, 52 is since 1999, a member of the direction of crude.
A start was responsible for the technology.
Later, he was in charge of the Treasury and with that came responsibility on the heritage of the company after the exit of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took charge of the direct marketing, the alien, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family is at the top of the publisher.
The children of crude had 19 and 17 years. His son Felix, which currently would have 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to "bridge the gap of 10, 15 years," according to crude.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With an eye on cases and Schaeffle Schickedanz, crudely stated that family businesses are not immune to decadence: "This always has affected families that are transmitted through the lure of search for capital, which have misjudged and they thought they could climb as well as the largest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had "delusions of grandeur," he says crude.
I do not see it as a taskmaster politician in this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play with the “ Time ” in the world league; these businesses have become too great.
Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that serves only to look at the mail, without even seeing some kind of deputies or surf the net.
Enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
See you on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a monthly subscription very low, less than half of what is paid by, for example, the data plan for the iPhone.
Given the success the company has brought two new devices: One exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free service data for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of the invention and its third encarnaciónn.
It is just as narrow his American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The price of monthly maintenance, about 12 euros a month, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphones already know what it is like to have to give up the data when it crosses the border or search desperately for a cafeteria with WiFi (or a connection of Fon) to check the mail.
The idea of a roaming a fixed price is incredibly attractive and long ago that would have to be in place.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand and very good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated ear pulling from the European Commission to achieve affordable prices for roaming across Europe have hardly had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin are afraid to use the data, and rightly so.
A aparatito as FonPeek (never ceases to be interesting that bear the name of the Fon when lacks Wifi) achieves this kind of tariffs means that operators are starting to think differently and to study different proposals with which to pay off its network of data.
Kindle is another good example, includes trafficking downloading books and other consultations on the Internet.
Without contracts and without the bagpipes.
It is a device connected and get paid for it to buy it, not month to month.
And that is what I hope to see some day with FonPeek, an option to purchase with access for life as Peek is already in the US.
Not because going to buy it.
I watch my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so, because I believe that it is a model that is fairer for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Colour fetish of Michelle
Yellow is, without doubt, the tone of choice of the first lady of the United States.
If you went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as US president with a clothing and a coat of this colour, has chosen the same to follow him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: The collection in Oslo, the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has led a model very similar in the two occasions: In addition to being a similar colour -amarillo verdoso with brilliant reflexes, twice the dress was composed of three parts -vestido, jacket and protected from the same tela-, and adornaba with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the trail of the Princess of Asturias and had opted to repeat vestaurio.
But the fabrics that are produced the two suits makes them very different.
If for the inauguration of was a fit fat, in Oslo is a velvet with stamping.
Supplements have also changed: Half the green shoes tacón again, and a similar model, but in Golden, now.
And equally different is the hair: One picked up on this occasion, melena rein the previous one.
75% of working mothers has had problems at work for motherhood
Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to become mothers.
It reveals the study 'Fertility and work history of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey conducted between 9.737 women aged 15-75 years leaves no doubt about this: 75 percent of working mothers saw limited opportunities in the field of work due to motherhood.
The study suggests that there are many differences in the beginning of living together as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether or not to work and the type of work they perform.
Those who don't work outside the home, working part-time, or have a job not stable, initiated before the coexistence in partner, are in the first pregnancy, and to have more children.
By contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delaying the coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged between 35 and 49 years with permanent work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that rises to 4.1 women with permanent jobs have needed more time of his life to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed wields much influence on maternity, albeit less on the timing of the pairing, "explains the CSIC researcher of the Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that distinguishes the age for women to marry and to have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the greater the age at marriage and who have their first child.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of between 35 and 49 years, those with elementary and high school have been mothers for the first time in the middle of 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"Further provides another division among women depending on their level of education.
While those with elementary school, marry and have their first child before getting a job stable, the middle or higher invest this sequence and give priority to ensuring a stable job as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "detailed Delgado.
Diane Kruger also is
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to his list of ambassadors envy: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress become image of different products of the brand, sang the universal slogan, 'Because I avail myself'.
The protagonist of "Joyeux Noël ', one of the most elegant actresses of the international scene, joins a number of other famous recruits of L'Oréal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penelope Cruz.

(Male, the cosmetics brand also has ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomía of Grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline mate in 'Loss').
The British Fashion Awards
The British have much to say in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives -diseñadores and models, yesterday and today - met at the annual delivery of their awards, to be held in London at the Royal Court os justice.
No one was missing to quote.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
The poker Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent give away in 'poker of aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a 30 x-rays of writers who have passed through her life literary (and, in some cases, also on the other).
It does not gender-predictable and fearsome (biographical profiles, life and work) but looking for something similar to the heart of ignition of the character creator.
The trip has its excitaciones and Vincent saves scares or iluminaciones.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and relecturas.
Here I leave you some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a pulsión spiritual, almost physical, the same as I felt without giving names: The pleasure against the dark destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilistic, Christian alegórico, he wrote what was in the blood, not the intellect, among the powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, pointless, as the road of the knife that was about to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was abducido by this woman with a passion that lasted 13 years, whose meat combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a privilege spiritual which was to reach the sky across the road to perdition."
On James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand metres of literature in the world, to be climbed over the fence north, from which it was played over and over again, the best alpinistas."
On William Faulkner: "It was a rare kind.
Itself, sometimes described as the heir of a landowner in the county and others who was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both were dreams of grandeur. "
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the cry insane thrown from a bridge by this character in Munich to carry its response to the bottom of the night of the 20th century under his literary form and did so in a trip to escape itself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day was brought to its knees and rezó: 'Dear God, please send to stop writing as a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after life extremely pleased to death."
On Virginia Wolf: "In the baggage also bore his depression.
The husband accepted with normality that she told that Eduardo VII the spied among the azaleas or that the birds singing in Greek.
It has never been the case of a man so patient and lover of a neurotic whose literary talent ran ahead of his madness. "
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos but try to inoculate to Joyce in Baroja?
What tried to Benet but move to Baroja by weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela but abducir fame of that man for their own pedestal? "
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother of about 70 years of age was walking by our neighbourhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people aged between 15 and 18 years spent with her and with our dog, a copy of mixed race, rescued the perrera and with no more than six kilos in weight and, without a word, she beat two kicks that left the dog badly injured.
Our indignation is glaring because there are fun in an assault charge to a small and defenceless animal, which of course, was hooked.
Add to this the suffocating that it led to a lady who was passing by and quietly, when lashed out at these individuals, arrived in fear for her physical integrity, since a energúmeno attacks an animal, it is able to do so with a woman, a child, an old man, or indeed with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident happened at 5 p.m. on a Tuesday, either by a traditionally quiet neighbourhood.
The dog was crying all day.
Incidentally, we made a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt that fits a lot and not to generate sensitivities, just to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spaniards.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to consider funny a defenceless animal cruelty free of charge to which we give love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where they have been good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mostly among younger motorists, reported today both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the hull, because it is the only element of protection capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the case of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, "that goes beyond design and manufacture products every day more secure" and asserted that also contributes to this goal through other actions of educational and informative.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets in the motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which will be distributed posters in more than 500 workshops on motorcycles, with the goal of maximum dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety is an ongoing concern "for the company, for being a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop products increasingly safe.
The sale of light commercial
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 units that were enrolled in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers' association Anfac manufacturers and sellers Ganvam.
The good thing, not osbtante, it should be put in quarantine for the reference that makes the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a drop of 60% over the prior year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the surge of the last month, enrolment accumulated in these 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous year.
Since January 95.853 units have been sold together all vehicles that make up the hotchpotch of the light commercial: Derived from cars, pick up, pickup trucks, vans and lorries, vans belonging / lightweight chassis.
I also have not gone away the dark clouds that most affect their demand, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized businesses, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
So the restrictions that closed the spigot for bank loans, is in addition to other factors such as the increase in the levels of unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
Against this background, and unlike cars, have been of little help aid to the purchase of 2000e.
To qualify, in addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs that go to acquire a commercial slight of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been giving testimony.
Yesterday, since Ganvam returned to recall the need to devote special attention on the part of the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrialists (lorries and buses).
The association of sellers predicts a similar to the year 2010, for which estimates a fall in sales (cars and 4x4s) of 19 per cent.
The emergency brake assist is already mandatory
As happened with the blockade of ABS brakes and will proceed with the ESP stability control, brake assist systems of emergency will have to be a compulsory element in European cars.
In fact, they already are in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles registered, while the rest is set for a period of absence until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians while on his way to work, it can also help prevent many collisions by scope.
The assistant to the emergency brake what it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, the system detects by the pisotón that gives the driver.
But this does not always maintained that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for car Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to slam on the brakes before the collision and half of them did not use any force.
To 1,100 accidents
The intervention of aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum the brake system, reducing the distance that used the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, could be avoided each year up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one of every four would be avoided sinister with damage to popularize them - when the so-called intelligent emergency brake system.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and alerts the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, will help to increase the pressure on the Pedestrian, if necessary.
In the event that it fails to react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises maximum effort to the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors delay until January the plan for Opel
While that workers at Opel's Figueruelas plant (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the day 8 probablemente- according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warned that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What does Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the party affected.
And this may make the final document which will be put to workers first and then to the governments of countries in which there are factories, have been delayed until early 2010.
In contrast, since GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admitted having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but gains strength the option of Dutch Skyper sports car manufacturer, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets of Saab to the Chinese Baic.
It took the decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold.
The wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For your last desarrolar, and expensive gem, engineers took the Porsche Boxster S as a base and got adelgazase nothing less than 80 kilos, which has left the báscula in only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to dispense with, first, the ceiling has been automatic for whom one of tarpaulin with actuation manual, thereby saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors as the GT3, 'are' other 15; cut through the climatizador, 13; reducing the fuel depot of 64-54 litres, won 7 kilograms more; mount bacquets 12 other sports and with the tyres light of 19 inches, five.
Finally, renounce the audio system DRC-30 contributed an additional six kilograms and changing the gunmen of the doors for a couple of cloth, per kilo remaining.
But it also offers to change PDK twin-embrague, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly for secondary roads in California, in stretches of mountain routes really revirados
Their behaviour can only be described as beyond reproach.
Reduction in weight does not mean that the car will not tread the asphalt with aplomb.
Quite the opposite: Not long testábamos a model so small and light that, in turn, drove so safe passage through curve, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete, able to heat their muscles in a short march during the time required, until he ordenemos that esprinte, to slow, to recover and return to squeeze its engine...
What I ask. Through his leadership, as forthcoming as accurate, what we share with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with a surgical precision.
The sound of the engine will
The sound of his bóxer V6, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very accomplished and could be enhanced with the option 'sport' and through a system that changes the roar of the engine, had already started earlier in the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, whether from unemployed or in recoveries.
The suspensions are strong, but not harsh or inconvenient.
The asphalt roads that we are experiencing with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car her good potholes.
Electronic aids barely went there throughout the journey; and that in any of the curves are ice at dawn and chip surface, late in the morning.
In short, a car ultra light, the more fun to drive than you can on the market, and that is something more than a simple amendment to the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, with a price of 70.831 euros.

The Baskonia be given away a victory in Israel
The Labour Fund achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in his visit to the complicated rules of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous casualties with which had the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and in this way is at the helm of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, with eight triple noted was the best of his team (29 valuation).
The team was able to fill the significant vitoriano absences of Herrmann, Oleson, vegetable or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work but had to suffer until the end, to secure the victory.
In addition, the great wisdom from the perimeter, with 16 triple annotated had much to do in the final success.
The match began looking for the azulgranas, which were made from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
For the first four baskets of the vitorianos were from the perimeter it was forecast that had come to the Israeli court with his wrists hot..
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the team alavés opted for the game inside Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with pitos and applause in the return to that outside his home, to further expand its advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic already started to excel as the best of his team with 13 points, while the 'least six' valuation of Splitter already raised fears about that it was going to be the best night of Brazilian.
But the party, despite being on track to rest, it was decided neither much less and the Maccabim wanted to remind the vitorianos that in his court does not win either, and with 'the hand of Elias' tightening managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellow' mark the return to the bright (50-49).
More Cons
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed to do a couple of games rightly for breath, and in those found the gun Teletovic Mirza, who, with three consecutive almost triple and the help of English and Ribas returned the scoreboard to an income reassuring (54-67), which managed to disguise the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alaveses turned out to be skin in the latest partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already warned that they were not going to let anyone take them what had been received during the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini Eidson and, to the best of his team not one day resigned itself and tried to keep alive his team from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter removed from faults, Ivanovic was not precipitated, defended well, and although the Israelis came in the final minute (80-85), the party was already owner and victory was escaping from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevented to battle the Unicaja
The Unicaja lost miserably in Greece before the Olympiacos and he ceded the lead in group B of the Euroliga, in a match marked by the casualties of the cajistas, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), facilitated the Greek victory.
The team malagueño will not be frightened by the atmosphere of the flag of Peace and Friendship, nor by the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful of Europe and with a large budget.
The game showed in the first quarter made it possible to dream of the Andalusian. An aggressive defence and three consecutive triple, two of the base Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio, dazzled on the premises 12-18 minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the premises in the domestic game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave him a return to the scoreboard 22-20 minute 13, at which point an action, signs of wrangling between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, marked the disqualification of both players.
The whole Greek started to show their superiority in both areas, where the low injury of pívot English Joel Freeland and the three personal misconduct of Carlos Jimenez, were weigh down the cajistas.
Among the home players and the Linas Kleizas Lithuanian strain, with its triple, increased the advantage 44-32 minute 19.
An increase impossible
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, that despite the 19 losses, was higher and even went so far as to match the difference of the contested encounter in Malaga 66-48 minute, 27, who was shaking the leadership of the group.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and to the last drop of Scottish pívot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all the disadvantages the Unicaja by the leadership and the triple of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57 minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos when clutching and given their superiority in inches inside the zone was unstoppable.
The Croatian Nikola Vujcic pívot, pulled the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja was snuffed out, handing the lead to Olympiacos.

Brazil is date at the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has since run to the permanence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, when his term officially completed.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where they remain a refugee from the 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to leave on 27 January, at the end of his term of office, it has to seek another destination."
The station also quoted the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "The position of mine is to leave as soon as possible, of course, with the backing of the government of Brazil," he declared Zelaya phone.
After the elections on 29 November (that resulted in the election of Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya said he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya the status of political refugee who sought to impose the Government "de facto" headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Many thank you
After days of wine and roses since last spring over the inflation of assets has been the dominant tone in markets, new uncertainty returned to reappear in the markets, which is not surprising because it is their natural state, in an environment in which players take decisions on the future inherently uncertain.
Medicine used by central banks in order to stabilize markets was monetize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving free bar of liquidity at rates close to zero for financial institutions to asset purchases to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have almost completed and, without questioning his heterodox policy of liquidity, begin to put some sand in the wheels, how did the ECB with its auction-year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain the economic recovery without measures as heterodox and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premium.
The volatility of stock markets and the spreads on corporate bonds have returned to rebound, although still far removed from paranormales levels that reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to nationalise risk private and public debt returns to be affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, leading to a widening of spreads the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but that arrived at Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the characterization of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, something of uncertainty is not wrong to silence the defenders of the moral hazard that tried to re-create over awareness on those responsible for global economic policy to have stopped the destructive effects arising from the credit crunch on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is to order a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, as of Dubai pint in a tribal fight between the emirs to reshape the power in the emirates of Greece and as we have already seen before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that is pulling the wraps.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that the Ecofin he slew to Hungary in a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and that it will allow a member country of the euro breached its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and take responsibility for its citizens on the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, how we look, we are faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums transitory, after some excesses in leveraged positions, would be later than expected.
In the case of Spain, while our public debt spreads widen like the European corporate bonds should not worry.
If Europeans diminish differentials and our continued to expand, then it would be risk idiosyncratic English.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our leading indicators are forcing the majority of services of studies to anticipate their scenarios of recovery and to revise upward its scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the fray with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur very life expectancy to his warning.
Again, it takes the whole pint will be an excellent opportunity to buy assets in Spain, though for the moment "prudence, friend driver."

The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sanchez Galan, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies to debate these days the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the chairman of the Gas Natural-Fenosa ', Rafael Villaseca, Galan gave the press a few dashes of what had raised in the subcommission behind closed doors.
For the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and other 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided it is kept open nuclear power plants in operation today.
If not, the necessary investments will not be $60 billion, but of up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be used to increase capacity in a generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections
From 2020, the issue is changing and we will have to increase the power.
Your bet focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture and, above all, of renewable energy.
In this case, believes that we need new 18,000 MW, albeit with other "energies of support."
Galan, who believes that the draft law on Sustainable Economy recently adopted by the Government is in line with what his company has been calling for, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to boost domestic consumption of coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the measures “ sporadic ”, as he called the chairman of Iberdrola.
Be that as it may, Galan believes that investment decisions, even though they are in the long term, it must begin to take because they take time to mature and needs a stable framework retributive to address them.

The Australian market infrastructures promises great works and privatisation, but carries a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that have followed the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to references Asian, and which remains unresolved issue for the Spanish giants of the industry.
Barely ACS has achieved a position in this market through its 30 per cent stake in Hochtief, the owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Assets millionaires
Pressing bid for a geographical area of the utmost importance to the industry, which already has a prominent presence through its activity as a provider of energy and in the business of desalination.
Among other assets, with its largest wind turbine park, Waubra (192 megawatts (MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies to lift and manage the desaladora Adelaide, with a budget of $700 million.

It is the largest operation to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the Administration fixes the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Despite the fact that this step of payment would be opened to traffic in recent months in 2014, it is not anticipated that the book is topped up until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two-lane by sense, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its funding.

Moreover, the company has transcended the project for the construction of the Tower King George, of 27 plants, in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were yet to start and Hochtief has closed the sale in 129 million.

A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to curb competition
The regulator of competition in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France Télécom to anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile phone with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and programmes of fidelity to consumers outside the scope of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French state-owned monopoly and still accumulates over 560 million euros in fines since 1994 by putting obstacles in their competitors.
The sentence yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the authority that oversees competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past, and that, therefore, is a recidivist.
Shop of applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened a store of Internet applications, with the aim of increasing the revenue that does not come from the transmission of voice.

Play the Champions has brought 476,4 million at the Madrid and the Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since she was born in 1992.
Meanwhile, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476,4 million since then, leaving them in the third and fifth club that more money have won in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has spread 5.362,5 million to EUR 105 teams (12 of them Spaniards) who have participated in the event since the establishment of the tournament in the season 1992 / 1993, according to data from UEFA.
The Real Madrid and Barcelona F. C. have come well off of this distribution.
The club target has been a third of the continent that more money has been nicked by participating, and the only, along with AC Milan, who has won three times the trophy.
Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the classification.
The list of the top Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams which, moreover, more money invoiced to engage the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both against the Barça.
Moreover, Spain is only the third country to more money has achieved through the Champions, despite having won more titles than any other (five, four of Italy, the three of England, and the two of Germany).
Distribution,
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated process of distribution of money that applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the agency which is chaired by Michel Platini expects to enter 1.09 million for the Champions League.
This money will be devoted to UEFA 413,1 million fixed payments: Each of the 20 clubs who participated in the preliminary round of ranking (including the Atlético Madrid) received $2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just by being there, plus an additional 550,000 euros for each party that dispute.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and by empatar (400,000 for each team). The octavofinalistas will receive three million each; the eight cuartofinalistas, 3.3 million.
The last four were embolsarán 4 million each.
The champion will earn $9 million, compared to $5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, the concept of fixed payments, a club will join at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça moreover, pocketed $2.5 million by winning the Supercopa of Europe in August.
But furthermore are variable payments, which are allocated 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to proportional to the value of every television market.
Spanish is the key, and has four seats.
The champion the previous year falls with 40 per cent of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth quarter.
The other side will be paid according to the number of matches that are played in this year's edition.

New tools for peritar cars
In these days of temporary and accidents, not only earn the workshops of cars.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister are towed to a workshop, where an expert to assess the damage and what it will cost to repair.
No sinister is equal, and the calculation of the cost of parts and the time of labour can be a long and complicated.
Calcularmanualmente the cost of compensation of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including pieces ymano labour, it may take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest software tools would be issue deminutos
That is why, almost 100% of the experts used this type of system.
Suppliers of services and solutions for valuation of sinister and maintenance work to compile the information that supply them with manufacturers, and then process and give it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, American products group, is the lead firm; 80% of the assessments are made with their products.
The other firms to compete in the field of the tools of appraisal and development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them is providing the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to treat continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years have been lanzadomás versions, variants ymotorizaciones than in the past fifteen.
As soon as a new car sale to the market, these companies are put to work.
It is a very hard work, because it has to catalogue every one of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle and introduce its price.
In addition, each model is a graphic portrayal "intelligent" where they can “ prick ” different parts of tourism.
If it is a model of ventamasiva, the work could be completed in a week if the process is going very fast.
Whether it is a car minority, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex provides complete information about 99.2% of cars that are traded in Spain.
Among more exclusive losmodelos have information on Porsche, but not of Ferrari or were, for example.
With regard to vehicles that circulates, exceed 99 per cent.
To do the job of documentation and the development of databases, Audatex account with eight centres scattered around the world (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each specialized in a specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually experts in mechanics) work in parallel with three computer screens.
Audatex spends 90 million euros a year in developing these databases.
Each month include 2.5 million data, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer a variety of products.
The more frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries are also tools for managing spare scrapping or to calculate the corrupt or residual value of a car.
The only company that provides a guide that reports on the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex is unable to provide this service in our country, but in the United States.
In the light of the products offered by Audatex is easy to get an idea of the kind of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard solution of valuation of sinister, designed to experts.
It includes cars, motorbikes and light commercial vehicles or heavy.
In addition to the cost of the parts, including the times of reparation estimated by the manufacturer or the standards of paint.
This tool is paid on the use, for each assessment.
The higher cost is $5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to 10 times a month.
After each insurer, which conducts thousands of expert reports, is negotiating a price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the identification of a vehicle and equipment with which left the assembly line only with its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the internet which allows bid for vehicles found sinister total.
Its service statistics is very useful for identifying trends, analysis or know geodemográficos diversions for omodelos brands.
One study, for example, how many models of certain brand have passed through the workshop because of breakdowns or how many had suffered serious accidents within a specified period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Markets, among others, Gt estimate, which also goes to experts and also provides digital images, access to spare time or price and officers from the manufacturer.
Gt Motive Einsa group is a company founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions in the assessment of damages, breakdowns or maintenance of the car
The Gt Guide of charges is a product of historical reference in the market.

Their turnover has grown at a rate of 20 per cent per annum over the past three years, and in 2008 invoiced 10,8millones euros.
At the beginning of last year began the process of internationalisation, with the installation of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966, and in 1979 was established in Spain.

The internet auction car accident
Last October the group bought Autoonline products, an internet platform for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles people affected.
The operation was a disbursement of 59.5 million euros by 85% of the company's capital, which could be expanded next year, the remaining 15 per cent.
The purpose of the acquisition was to offer more value added services to its clients, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This service of valuation and sale is directed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, business of renting, workshops, scrapping and sellers professionals who must be registered before we begin to conduct operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, half of them in Germany.
Among its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 vendors registered and 4,000 experts.
They are handled 3,000 advertisements in newspapers and in the Spanish market include about 100 new ads every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been dismissed cannot return to move, but it can be used as a spare parts that are not damaged.
Cars with historical value can be high even though they have been discharged after a rambling efforts.
Budget of workshop in four steps
With the tool Auda-Workshop, the company Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in only four steps: To identify the vehicle, looking for a replacement, create budget and generate budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, to a greater or lesser extent tend to be more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 44 78 vans and trucks.
Of course, we need to use a computer connected to the Internet.
Once identified the model to repair through its chassis number, features a graphic portrayal of real model in question, and then you select the parts necessary.
The user can include variables such as the price of labour, surcharges or discounts, and then you can print the budget to hand over the client.
AudaTaller is not a tool of valuation as AudaPlus, but rather a catalogue of references.
The main difference between the two systems are that the mentored the workshop included no estimated time of labour.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is $350 euros per year, that the customer can finance.
Currently the company Audatex is working to ensure that these images are three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics view very favourably, as it will enable, for example, select a door and turn to see the side home.
