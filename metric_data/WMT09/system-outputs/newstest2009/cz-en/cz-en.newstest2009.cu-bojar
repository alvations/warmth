Lawmakers so ignoring the challenge President George Bush to support the plan.

The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven percent and the drop in a similar scale, the last in 1987. 
Index sank even before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal in the House of Commons not passed, index found himself in the free fall. 
Congress stepped back: the US government can to banks, 700 billion 
The leaders of the U. S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed to the wider form of the Agreement on the financial support for America's financial system. 
Will vote on early next week. 
American policymakers have made the breakthrough in talks on the approval of the life of the plan in the form of financial support for America's financial system in the volume of 700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kronor). 
Won, however, is not yet. 
Members of Congress that they must complete some of the details of the Agreement, than will be able to publish the final form of law and vote about him. 
The plan of the aid of the financial system will be discussed in the land of the House of Representatives in Monday. 
On the Sunday I said the agency Reuters the President of the Committee for the banking and financial services house of Barney Frank. 
In the Senate would, according to sources may vote on a plan of perhaps the first Wednesday. 
By economists should be notification that rescue plan for the approval of occurs, the first major psychological factors for the recovery of financial markets. 
Then, however, there is a ``sobered`` due to the complexity of the mechanisms, such as the markets and help achieve in practice. 
Paulson: plan shall be effective 
``we made much progress. 
We solved our different views about how the look of package to stabilize the market, ``said for the agency Bloomberg a Democrat Nancy Pelosiová.

``we are on the verge of a definitive agreement of the plan, which will not work and must be on the market also an effective. 
Should still in the restoration plan continue, but I think we there, ``he said Paulson. 
Signal to the Asian trading 
The global financial crisis has led to the stock market, which are falling sharply. 
By nevadského of Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, so policymakers trying to that in Congress came to a definitive agreement still in Sunday. 
Want to the calm investors, before the trading on the Asian financial markets, which are in time zone first, where the decision of the ANC could affect the Monday's trading. 
In the meantime, however, is not yet with certainty clear when they both chambers of the Law of the U. S. Congress to vote, or whether they can negotiations at the last moment came on some of the problem. 
Lawmakers hope that it will be approved in the next few days. 
The law, however, almost a series of changes. 
The total amount of the intended for assistance for the system should be divided into two parts. 
Initial $350 billion should be available as soon as possible, as claimed the President George Bush. 
Congress but can block the release of the remaining amount if you will have the impression that program fails to meet his functions, and that in the sequence of other 100 billion and later final $350 billion. 
Bush appreciated the progress of negotiations 
The President may this Decision veto, but Congress may his overrule the veto. 
Despite these changes, however, remained the basic idea of the programme, which was to finance to buy - back of bad mortgage securities, the value of which to plummet, with hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to meet their mortgages, maintained. 
``drew up all. 
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sundays and the Senate on Monday, ''said Republican Sen. Judd, Gregg. 
With the progress of negotiations is satisfied, and President Bush. 
His Tony Fratto spokesman said Bush is the Saturday progress satisfied and valued ``of a bipartisan efforts to stabilize the our financial markets and to protect our economy``. 
Restrictions on the golden parachutes 
The President of the bank of the Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, head of the mediator, said that policymakers have agreed to the responsibility for the money program, the protection of taxpayers of losses, the conclusion of the exemptions, the timing of the financing plan. 
The new law has also restrict the so - called golden parachutes for director společnostní participating in the programme and set up the Committee, which will have over the Fund surveillance. 
He should follow the Treasury. 
``we worked on the very hard, and we made much progress in the direction of the Agreement, which will not work, and it will be useful for the market and for all Americans,`` he said Paulson. 
The plan also counts with using for homeowners who have difficulties paying. 
The government should negotiate a new tranche in mortgages, which the purchase of a, with a view to reducing the cost of the payment for the debtors and enable them to could leave their homes. 
Mark: psychological assistance 
The proposed plan is under the chief economist at the PATRIA FINANCE David Mark a good idea, very difficult, but it will be its implementation. 
``and that's because he knows how mechanism and at what price, the problem assets may be. 
This will, for it, as between the splits the loss of the financial sector, and the government, ``said this week for server immediately. com Mark. 
If the plan will be approved now, or early next week, not by Mark so substantial. 
``much more important is that had this týdenkongresmani agreed that this plan support, and that the hallowed it as soon as possible, it will be. 
The psychological meaning of the Agreement on the will of approval, is the most important in this time, ``he emphasized Mark. 
A duel in the blade of a knife: MP3 Player against the mobile. 
Consultation, as you select 
While nearly every cell can play MP3 files, no MP3 Player can make a phone call. 
It seems clear that it is better to buy a phone. 
Yet there are strong reasons to man bought the stand alone player. 
Option completely depends on the type of application and the claims of the future of the owner. 
About hard to home one peak dear phonograph, to listen to the latest album Turbulenc highs. 
On the one hand, such music products to the lp plates come and of qualitative for it, or there is no objective reason. 
Crunch - if it in your rack vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues, probably on such a record player at least counts. 
The same is it with the music on the roads, music, so the compressed simplified - music in MP3 files. 
And there are price and qualitative category. 
For someone may be unacceptable spend on the player eight thousand kronor, as well as the fan pink Floyd about difficult to zkousne headphones for twenty crowns of the market - house. 
Two extremes, between which is not enough disk space for each. 
Selection is wide. 
It shall act and resilience batteries 
Some high - music player can manage much more than just the music, but what most mobile or by accident. 
No current apparatus is not as universal as tel. 
In addition to the primary functions, telephone and esemeskování, can play the music and video, both recording, has the better, the worse camera and might have and navigate. 
And when taking into account smartphony and Messenger, you will be in his pocket, and a small computer. 
It is something of a miracle, after all, no refrigerator can not grilovat and no television a nothing. 
Mobile phone universality brings and disadvantages. 
The more functions to the mobile phone using, the sooner you send to nabíječce indicator on display. 
And the music is one of the biggest glutton energy. 
Few cellular can play the music for more than ten twelve hours, a majority of it is far less. 
In this respect are music player (specifically the simplest) significantly more powerful. 
In the case of cheap mobile therefore expect that for more than a few hours you to play. 
If you to that even here and there they call, get to work for certain even one nabíječku - to apply for more expensive apparatus. 
In the case of MP3 Player have this problem, even the worse lasts at least 9 hours of continuous service to one charged. 
Another problem occurs while loading of music to mobile phone. 
Unfortunately, we have only limited part of the apparatus USB universal connector, and, moreover, not all of them can be directly connect to computer without special software. 
Of course the music to load directly to the storage card, but only a few card reader without reducing consult a memory card, which in the mobile use. 
In the case of players to the exceptions (iPod) any special software need. 
Just the apparatus populate the music via USB from your computer. 
Most of the mobile and players have already itself creates a musical the rank by the name of the artist, album name, genre or to the evaluation of the user. 
Some of the apparatus appear only directory tree, as in Windows Explorer and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phone operating system). 
The Player is easier to handle, mobile more can 
In the selection of particular device interest in particular on the endurance, memory capacity of the battery, quality and type of audio output, and, of course, and the comfort control. 
If you 've a music, in particular, the background and if it to listen to each day only a short time to be in the car, just you any Mobil, who plays MP3 files. 
Which already can really almost any mobile phone. 
You need not too to see what audio formats cellular or the player can. 
MP3 files can manage all and the vast majority of music, which shall be given to you, it is in this format. 
Belongs to the most widespread and in addition to him the great majority of instruments even a music in the media audio. 
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and his iPody). 
Better mobile also allow you to, for example, the purchase of music on - line. 
Just over the mobile Internet page to see the operator (or another provider) and (song or album purchasing a. 
This service already itself might be compelling argument for acquisition of the musical mobile phone. 
Unfortunately, the operator menu is abysmal, and limits, the majority on only rychlokvašené radio hits. 
Also prices are the lowest. 
In general, however, assume that it is this way of sales of music (whether through GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) into the future mastered music industry. 
Mobil most people still wears for himself. 
Whenever a desire to hear something, cellular in his pocket a, while MP3 Player is left at home. 
Still, however, depends on whether with also always wear a headphones or at least wired hands - free. 
If not, you can use the dock speaker which has almost every cell, but only minimum MP3 Player. 
About the biggest advantage of musical mobile will be for many of the price. 
The cheapest is normally under three thousand. 
For three and four thousand kronor already one very decent Walkman. 
Majority, but you will restrict the absence of output to the normal headphones. 
The best and the technical page with telephones and with the 3.5 mm jack of normal headphones stands to 15.000. 
Advantage, players out of other easy the handler. 
The simplest - not necessarily cheapest (see our selection) - the Player manages to control are you sure each. 
Minimum functions, resemblance to control with the previously the normal kazeťákem or to be gramophone is clear. 
There is no risk of collision in the form of error on account of the giant mobile Internet and subsequently for the transfer of the data. 
After which the apparatus dip 
Even the cheapest mobile (e. g. Vodafone 527) are normally the slot on the removable storage card (the type of M2, microSD, etc.). 
Even with dokoupením the cards to fit into two thousand crowns. 
It shall, however, attention. 
In the case of basic models are supported only cards with the maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive can cope with 8 GB paměťovkami. 
If you have already cellular and you want to do not buy cheap MP3 Player, reach out for Cowonu, Creativu, Sony, Samsung, Emgetonu or iriveru. 
According to the capacity (Max. 2 GB) must spend more than 1 100 crowns. 
If you belong to the audience tougher reach out better after the specialised mobile - Walkman (Sony Ericsson, some of the Nokia and Samsung). 
These instruments are to separate the control buttons for MP3 and comfort of operator shall be so close to individual MP3 Player. 
Far is in the field of Sony Ericsson, whose mobile from a series of Walkman has the same user interface as self sold MP3 Player. 
The same service, and at the same price category into four thousand kronor, but with a greater capacity of memory (to 16 GB) and (loiter the battery (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will taken MP3 Player from the abovementioned markers. 
The first virtual pager arrive in the Czech Republic has already in this year. 
Maybe 
Mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe. 
Yet he was missing something - virtual operator, who would the classic forced had become cheaper. 
It may not be missing you long. 
That Czech operator is among the most expensive at all in Europe, we mobile. com wrote it many times. 
After all, said even ČTÚ, who said that the price is higher than the SMS with us in the rest of the Union. 
After the last action of the European Commission on the regulation of roaming charges so maybe there is a paradox - for some customers Czech mobile operator SMS from abroad cheaper than at home. 
How can it be that prices in the Czech Republic shall hold in comparison with Europe so high? 
The answer is simple, missing competition, which they really wanted to drop to fight. 
This may sound paradoxically, we 're not three mobile network and penetration high over 100%. 
Mobile operators on the contrary, like rails, the Czech market is extremely competitive. 
In that they often says and the President of the Council of the Czech telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) Paul Dvořák, who put several times in the past, that for other operators in the Czech Republic location is not. 
It is true, perhaps, that classical operator with custom networks too chance is perhaps (after all, would be difficult to sought rate). 
Yet there is but one - virtual operator. 
The entry of virtual operators to mobile market had brought a significant reduction in prices, which then had to respond and classical operators. 
Yet even before the entry into force of jack as Tesco mobile or virgin Mobile on the market in the United Kingdom similar voices as for us. 
It turned out, though, that the place for such operator and may be really successful. 
After all, we need for examples go too far. 
In February of this year you communicated the startup operator virtual Mobilking in Poland. 
For a half - year, this operator will get more than 100.000 customers and State with its the fifth - largest operator. 
Yet for Mobilkingem stands the financial group Penta, which in the Czech Republic custom outside the other U: fona. 
Advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of concentrate on a much more specific target group. 
For the work effectively, for it is much less customers than classical operator. 
Entail a relatively high costs to the construction, operation and maintenance of mobile network. 
In a world with so virtual operators normally profile as a low - cost - offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced closer supply of services. 
So perhaps Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half the cheaper than his competitors. 
But how shows an example Mobilkingu in Poland, it may be quite good stroke and betting the fresh target group. 
This operator has aimed specifically at the man. 
``administrative lads shall elect Mobilking - operator, who like and which may trust,`` says David Seibertz CEO Mobile entertainment company, carrying on this virtual operator. 
Hard to say, if you would like the draft as in Poland could catch him, and for us. 
A spokesman for doubt Vodafonu _ Čepický: ``Czech market is relatively small for segment access, to which it is most of virtual operators based. 
In addition, it is of the supply of services relatively saturated. `` 
In the Czech Republic, without the chance, they say the mobile operators 
But it seems almost certain that, where in the Czech Republic a virtual mobile operator, it will Mobilking. 
``on the expansion of this talk in the Czech Republic of successful project, but negotiations look too come along. 
Rather, it will run Mobilkingu in other countries of our region, ``she said in a telephone interview for mobile. com John studničková, print speaker Penta financial group. 
Indirectly so, confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic of this idea certainly are interested in. 
On the contrary, rather trying to do all so that any potential competitor emerged. 
Interest on running virtual operator mobile already longer group GTS great Novera that he wanted to do next step to become real competitor Telefóniky O2 on the corporate customers. 
``we have a great interest to our customers can offer, but not only fixed and mobile telecommunications services. 
And that the sooner the better. 
For this option are repeatedly acted with all Czech mobile operators. 
With some of them we have succeeded in the proceedings of the move, ``says print a spokesman for the group of Paul Kaidl. 
Thus, he may flashing of better times. 
From official information, it seems that the first virtual operator may have to wait until the end of the year. 
For now, but his rise to the accompanies the impenetrable wall silence. 
``in this moment believe that it is on the Czech market space for full of virtual operator. 
The Czech market is compared to other markets a very specific. 
Yet on the shoulder us no body with a complex and serious project in this area, ``he said in his expression of for mobile. com Vlastimil hornets from the Print department Telefóniky O2. 
The specificity of the Czech market refer and other operators. 
Print a spokesman for the t - mobile phone Martin Kemrová supplies in rare conformity with making O2: ``has no viable and mutually advantageous commercial project, on which it would be possible to build.`` 
And he adds: ``in the T - mobile phone to the end of the year, difficult to a virtual operator 'appears. 
In the moment he must have on the table a specific agreement to be considered in the short run. `` 
Vodafone - focused their attention rather to meet the requirements of custom 3G licence. 
_ Čepický it says: ``negotiations with the potential virtual operators open, and, in particular in the field of cost - sharing and infrastructure. 
This is a view of the aspects of the customers for beneficial. 
The main strategies Vodafonu in this area is to find the partner for building a shared network for the rapid mobile Internet. `` 
The responsible authorities - with one hand operators 
Cell phone procedure is easy to understand the entry of another operator would increase competition, he would to the decrease in the prices and thus to a decline in their profits. 
So why the emergence of such competitors to facilitate? 
On that, when a little respect, operators can drag for one of the rope, reflects tug - of - war around the U: fon. 
About the maximum pressure in the direction of the ČTÚ went at the time when the risk U: fon from company t - mobile. 
To suggest that publicly available information from Web pages ČTÚ. 
Now, but just U: fon convenient as argument, why don 't allow virtual operator. 
Martin Kemrová the said: ``competitive environment of mobile market recently potentiated, in addition, the entry into force of the fourth of mobile operator on the market. 
Having regard to the nature of the market in mobile work, it is clear that the entry of other players on it, and in particular to its services by high requirements. `` 
Whereas this approach mobile operator but directly bewildering strongly in Czech regulatory authorities. 
It's not just a position ČTÚ, unfortunately, which in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - does not affect the powers of the conditions of competition. 
Those are exclusively by the office for the protection of competition (ÚOHS). 
But he had to an issue of his typical position. 
``input operator virtual to mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract between the mobile operator and virtual operator on the hiring out of the necessary infrastructure. 
No such contract has not been concluded, so far as the supply of potential candidates most likely not for the classic operators sufficiently remarkable, ``he said in answer to our query Christopher Chalupa of the external relations department Úohs. 
From the representatives of the operators as follows formulated by the expression of about no surprise. 
From the office to represent the interests of consumers and, inter alia, to ensure that no one abuse of its position on the market, it is more than to the parlous state. 
Especially when Christopher Chalupa adds: ``abroad, where the virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their market entry contributed to lower prices for mobile phone service.`` 
Perhaps but pressure on the correct operation of the market environment and the price decrease does not belong to the interests of Úohs. 
In truth shocking to its case is to touching the interplay of three mobile operators, which results from their reactions. 
The question of whether this is really just a chance, he offers completely alone. 
As well as those very price of petrol at gas stations is certainly a hard of accident and competitive fight. 
``office in this matter has no signs of anti - competitive conduct, and has therefore reason in some way interfere. 
None of the operators does not have a dominant position, therefore does not have adequate increased responsibility for their conduct in the market. 
The necessary tools for the opening of the market for virtual mobile telecommunications operators likely meet and regulators, ``he said in his expression of Chalupa. 
Interpretation of a dominant position on the market is one of the many of the points. 
Of course, there is the analysis of relevant markets drawn up ČTÚ, according to which they are telecommunications from the point of view of competition the single market. 
On that market then, of course, none of the Czech operators does not have a dominant position. 
Some of the legal experts but offer another view - to the operator of the virtual need is always the agreement of the network. 
And mobile operator - has a total logically - to its network monopoly. 
So in a specific range must necessarily a dominant be. 
Even if we but acknowledged that argument, for Úohs should be at least warning that three mobile operators making a remarkably similar. 
The complaint of a series of candidates (including the company GTS Novera) show that, in the negotiations with all operators to face very similar obstacles. 
Outsourcing liability to the ČTÚ is then in telecoms relatively normal trick that Úohs gives from the matter his hand away. 
We encountered him already in several similar cases. 
Sorry to recently adopted novels telecommunications law, the extension of the powers ČTÚ to the area of competition in telecoms failed to promote, although you from that many experts promised to improve the situation. 
This must representatives Úohs know more than well, but apparently are their interests elsewhere. 
It is this, when no one was looking 
Yet unheeding remains the functioning of some pseudovirtuálních operators, which in the Czech mobile network exists just a few. 
They are the firms issuing the custom price lists of mobile telephone services which are but public only partially. 
Usually that is a multilevel firms marketing. 
Custom mobile phone service so offers should be Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife, and many others. 
Price lists of such firms are usually get only to select. 
Magic is that the company to the operator is acting as a classic corporate customer, ordered by a large number of Mr. Sim cards. 
As a major customer then get special price (and other) the menu. 
The problem is that the commercial conditions of cell phone all Czech přeprodej similar prohibition. 
``where there may be cases for which are speaking, it could be a breach of the conditions to which we studied and may result in close cooperation with the company,`` she replied to our query for this problem Kemrová Martin. 
But it is unlikely that the similar activity to the responsible people from the cell phone. 
In particular, in the case of three referred to firms can go on thousands of customers. 
None of the operators shall not prevent such a procedure. 
From the activities of such firms have a considerable gains, while it is - - to the difference between actual of virtual operators - not do not pose a threat to its own official marketing. 
Of the possible problems notifies _ Čepický: ``laws similar speculation allows, however, the services of such firms uses only a negligible percentage of customers. 
You must also accept that the SIM card in their phone - led to their name, can not with her plnohodnotně as regular customers, dispose of cell phone. `` 
That would but should be ČTÚ at least odd. 
In addition, shall be opened the next question for ÚOHS. 
If the mobile operators blinking above a similar in his eyes, why blocks the operator virtual? 
Necessary to provide that the ÚOHS has to reveal similar activities relatively strong powers, and if you will want to, may not be content with the explanation of the operators that nothing that have no idea, and their commercial conditions that the prohibition. 
When the most expensive 
As I in the story, several times, the entry of virtual operators to mobile market brought zaznamenatelný fall in prices for services. 
He practically in all countries, where the virtual operator is, tried to classical operators their of more or less impede the. 
They used arguments were virtually identical - too small, or too saturated market, problems with the quality of the services, etc. 
In the advanced countries but just at this moment had hit the regulatory authorities, rather than the interests of protecting their cell phone, but their customers. 
Whether the formal measures or of informal pressure then reach that there is a first virtual operator and to him the nabalovali more. 
Unfortunately, the Bohemian regulatory authorities have passed the case as a hot potato. 
From our experience, we can escape the impression that ambiguity in competence in these cases more than you. 
But throw flintu to rye. 
If you are behind - the - scenes information of good and virtual pager we soon discover, really Czech mobile market may rozhýbe again. 
If any of the operators the existence of a virtual operator mobile said, hard to be able to Úohs remain hollow to reject (discrimination) other candidates. 
And we will call to cost more than in the rest of Europe. 
New Czech anthem has four new version.

Listen to four implementation of new versions of the Czech national anthems. 
On the Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Bohemian statehood, solemnly introduced a new recordings national anthems where the home of my own.

With such a desire reportedly in 1945 brought some of the group Sudetenland Germans to the US President. 
It follows, inter alia, of the letter, who acted in a private archives and is now stored in collections jihočeské scientific library. 
The Germans of of the Czech Krumlova demand in a letter to U. s. President, to allow the return of ``šumavské župy`` - seized Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia. 
``understand we correctly situation and to be sure the words that American troops come to the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,`` wrote in a letter, signed the words ``people who is the fate of the Šumavy at the heart of``. 
Because the connection to Czechoslovakia gives the allegedly Sudetenland the Germans - when knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only on the brutality, ruthless, understanding, oppression, and slavery, please the authors of the letter of the U. S. president to above Šumavou took the protectorate for the present and the eternal times. 
``We can 't believe that you without regard to the opinion of a quarter of a million people admitted this territory of a State us foreign, who oppress and is refuted by minorities and nothing, quite nothing did not contribute to the victory of the allies,`` wrote in a letter. 
The reason why the authors can not sign, allegedly the fear of revenge ``Czech oppressors``. 
Should the US President allegedly doubted the sentiment šumavských Germans, was enough to in šumavské župě hold a referendum on whether to its people want to become part of the US or live under the auspices of the United States. 
Although the text of the letter may in today ’ s knowledge of the history of the post - war is a little naively, according to some enthusiasts suitably illustrates the Sudetenland expectations Germans. 
Even if the Czech Germans had to at least showed that they will act on their expulsion from the Republic, only a few such the possibility of introducing at all. 
Some waited, that the United States and Britain negotiate of a particular type of autonomy. 
Next, we believed that simply remain in Czechoslovakia. 
Confirms that and the great Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Czech Budějovicích. 
It was for war as budějovický inflated to the German navy to baltu. 
When he was at the end of the war seized the British and placed him in the prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans for him to be taught Czech. 
``they believed to return home, will be the Czech handy,`` he said Chalupa. 
None of the German prisoners, wild before the war in Czechoslovakia, he reckoned with will be on the basis of the decree Benešových left out of the Republic.

The President of the interim Israeli governments Ehud Olmert spoke for the recovery of virtually all of the territory of the occupied in 1967, thus Předjordánska, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians, and Syria. 
He did so in an interview, which in Monday published a book Jediot Achronot.

Questions after the accident: the flight attendants on a bus unlawful? 
The law is not known, walk in the long - range can not be the bus 
In connection with a tragic bus accident of the student agency, near the Italian padova arose the question whether may flight attendants, and travellers for journeys by after the bus. 
``If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, is the steward activity contrary to the law on the road,`` says a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation Charles Hanzelka. 
When an accident, which last week perished stevardka 22 years, probably caused the driver of the goods vehicle, who bus crossed the path. 
The girl in the moment unfortunately, sitting beside the driver, to at least the safe place in the car, although he is reserved for two more other places. 
The bus may, however, crash, or stopping sharply, and at a time when He leaves steward coffee or newspapers. 
Plays a role, whether it is the bus according to the technical licence is fitted with a points to stall. 
If it is not in the bus homologováno, the traveller must sit up. 
Main - beam buses student agency space to hold still do not; which currently. com confirmed and the head of the firm Radim Jančura. 
``This we with the Ministry of addressed and at first movement of travellers kept. 
At length that invoked and have the travellers may walk for the journey to the bathroom, where they are to his seat, ``said its opinion. 
The law steward does not recognize 
There is a consistent legal the interpretation of the role of the steward - no legal provisions this role does not address. 
No legal regulation, however, neither prohibits carriers to provide services. 
The law on the road transport knows only the term the guard of the vehicle; his rights and obligations defined, ``adds less unambiguously Hanzelka spokesman. 
The Director of the use of road vehicles of the Ministry of transport Joe devout instead, argue that the law treatment sufficiently. 
``Does that matter if the bus in homologaci allowed space to stall. 
That's the end of the matter, ``he says. 
Buses divided on urban, where are the space to the stalls and limited the maximum rate of long - distance, with points to the restless with higher allowable speed and on the main - beam without places on the restless with the maximum allowable speed and seats fitted with safety belts. 
As in the aircraft, says expert 
Expert BESIP to transport the safety of James Hořín in the movement of the flight attendants on board the bus see fundamental problem. 
``in continuous driving many danger, the situation can be related to service item in the aircraft. 
Or there is some, when he comes turbulence and flight attendant may strike to the head. `` 
``If you would, however, the bus stopped abruptly, of course shall apply the laws of physics. 
As well as in urban bus or the tram. 
The safety of the steward must address the carrier internal provisions, ``he says, and also says, from the point of view of law is the subject of unresolved. 
Jančura service is willing to cancel 
The student agency offers services steward bus as one of the carrier. 
The two hundred employs them. 
The Director shall neither after the accident of their profession shall not be regarded as a risk. 
``Once but resuming the impression that the occupation steward risk, so it is cancelled. 
Coffee and newspapers they can get in the advent of passengers. 
It saved it, and the costs, ``he says. 
As the interest on the safety of make the case of the absence of steward in their car director of Asiany Alexei Litvin, which operates a fraction of the lines in comparison with the SA. 
``We don 't have stevardky, against it we stand, from the beginning. 
Sooner or later it end a fatal accident, ``he said before for the week less than a year ago. com. 
She became very tragedy 
In the event of an accident regular services to Naples perished young stevardka from Plzeňska, which the company was working for two years. 
Slovenian Kamion probably across the road without the use of arrows hand emergency lane, blocking the path of the bus. 
His driver tried to avoid a proceeding, touching on him, however, the right of the front part. 
That was sold out two space allocated for rest steward, Jančura refuses to. 
``These space for remote communication is not possible to check out, are blocked.`` 
The company intends to sue the truck driver. 
To indemnify the family girls agency to wait for the judgement of the court, but the financial compensation expected by the culprit. 
The adjustment of the law? 
On the edge of sight 
The specification of the movement of the flight attendants on board the bus could bring the adjustment of the law to which over the year is working třicetičlenná expert group of the Department of Transportation. 
``to any specific to a conclusion, however, reach. 
Buses or too does not address, rather scatter system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phone in proceedings, ``says expert Hořín. 
``the Department of Transportation be regarded the steward for something fundamental way threatened the passenger safety,`` concluded Hanzelka spokesman, that the safety of buses is in the powers of the police and offices of safety at work. 
Düsseldorf hope is Frankfurt 
Uppercase words in the letter of the staff of the Bank WestLB missing. 
Connect units of this money institutions with Düsseldorf Frankfurt deka - banks - - a ``of the central institution of financial group of thrifts for trade in capital markets,`` read the letter, which is on the public got on Monday. 
WestLB by the letter in the transaction placed ``set of competencies`` to ensure the long - term yields. 
And all he could be a decisive pulse of such a connection to another compounding in the sector of the banks. 
Such stories arise, if he wants to the board in problematic period demonstrate ability to act. 
Unstable WestLB always under considerable pressure. 
Not only by the European Commission, but also from the federal Office for the supervision of financial services, whose communication of the Earth's government in the North - Rhine - Westphalia, that it is time to find solutions for the future, is still fresh. 
The connection between deka - banks, savings and loan associations which customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whether any species, however, speak long time - - and on the Frankfurt side. 
The head of deka - banks Franz waas the presentation of the results of the half - yearly at the end of August had heard that, in the event of the merger of his of the bank of the house of Mainzer Landstra ß e with one of the banks, such as with the Bank Helaba or WestLB, see sense. 
The Administrative Council deka - banks, for which it is from one half of the Earth's bank and from the other unions thrifts, however, the board of directors authorized the talks with WestLB on common commercial activities. 
It could be here to go on transactions on the capital market or their part. 
The talks, however, only began to say, financiers. 
On the deka - banks, which with their 3 000 employees belong to important employers to the financial market in Frankfurt, in connection with the consolidation in savings sector to speak for the first time. 
In 2003, it was a moment that it could result in a merger deka - banks with Landesbank Rheinland - pfalz and with the Bank Helaba. 
From this trojspolku eventually was nothing. 
Shortly after the plans of the merger were given to the public, declared itself with hesenská regional government against the participation of the bank Helaba. 
Or both of the remaining bank houses so connected. 
Landesbank Rheinland - pfalz instead, gained Landesbank Baden - wuerttemberg from Stuttgart. 
And yet there repeatedly speculation about the connection deka - banks, the banks. 
In recent years, however, to the speculation about the conjunction of its financial house with other expressed negatively Günther Merl, chairman of bank Helaba. 
However, it seems that, irrespective of the uzrává belief that the alignment of the various banking home of public sector is compulsory. 
Now after the elections to the planet's Diet in Bavaria, as the first came to start connection BayernLB with Landesbank Baden - Wuerttemberg. 
For Helabu it is not very good news. 
Where should the pressure to further increase mergers, coming gradually on the possible partners for such a connection. 
In the south only would play second fiddle, and yet that financial crisis facing has significantly better than bank houses in Munich and in Stuttgart. 
Link with the WestLB back in early - prohibit a Union thrifts and office giro bank hessen - thüringen, who has in Helabě pětaosmdesátiprocentní share. 
In the account, so was the most Nord lb. 
Geo - strategic considerations of this type are, but only one party of the problem. 
On the other hand, it is a question of how much together matches business models of individual institutions. 
In June Merl said that the critical question, business model which should be ensured by the future competitiveness of länder banks, the German Union thrifts and office giro bank has not yet answered. 
All would also likely to end WestLB layout in this institution, of course, no one wish. 
It is therefore also in a letter to the board of directors talk that is attempting to ``comprehensive solutions`` for the entire banking house. 
Whether and how it will be able to connect with traverse the individual components with deka - banks, time will tell.

For Elena is the first time, for the third time or Luc fourth time. 
But this time there will be Elena as his friend, and so he will be all changed, he says. 
For them, in the case of pětilitrového barrel tags Kaiser, is a stronger, bearded fellow and two hundred tourists to the Oktoberfestu proves how deep tones can issue of his throat.

Sleepless night for the creditors hypo Real Estate 
Even more last week federal Minister of finance peer Steinbrück stressed that the German bank system is relatively stable. 
Well, that the policies of the word ``relatively`` and in his claim vpletl and the fact that the German banking sector will not spared of recession. 
For it on the past the weekend occurred. 
Index Dax followed the financial house specialising in the financing of the real estate hypo Real Estate (HRE) to get from the consortium German banks credit of several billion to protection from turbulence in the markets. 
The person familiar with the situation in the Monday said the agency Reuters, that such credit support will go up to 35 billion euros. 
Interest will have hypo Real Estate (HRE) to pay the amounts actually only of exhausted. 
Money would come from private and of public banks. 
In the background of the loss of subsidiaries Depfa. 
This state financier, in accordance with the newspaper reports to the long - term projects to which borrowed money, extremely refinance short - term, which now because of distrust of the markets is not possible. 
In the first half of the year 2008 the reserve of banks has dwindled to 95% to 2.37 million euro and fell slightly, and the share of the capital of the 1.6 to 1.45 per cent. 
Normal revenue and net income from financial transactions from the previous year, declined to zero, the income from increased values of claims and of certain of the securities, and also of the abolition of reserves for credit trading dropped more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million. 
Only with higher yields of refunds for the subsequent posting costs in the restructuring of the former groups Depfa and from the refund of interest in accordance with the order of the tax and for the provision of trade for koncernové undertakings was šestnáctiprocentní decline to the side of the yields of even moderate. 
An earlier national financier, after its privatization in 1990 burned the mortgage for self - employed, which then were from the portfolio of services provided and further kept Aareal banks. 
The classic state funding earn too little, engaged shall then be Depfa more strongly in infrastructure projects and for the financing of the cooperative projects of private investors and State (private - public - Partnership, PPP) and internationally to diversify. 
From their subsidiaries must now hypo Real Estate something to write off, and these depreciation will have a ``major tangible effect`` to the calculation of the profit and loss of the group, as some vaguely to hear. 
The fact is that the dividend. 
It for the year 2007 was truncated two thirds. 
Hypo Real Estate is from the Depfa major financier state and infrastructure projects. 
More than other institutions depends on the refinancing of the inter - bank market, because it has no deposits customers. 
After the fall of the U. S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago virtually dried well of inter - bank loans, because of the Bank ’ s especially liquidity. 
Hypo Real Estate needs a year for the part of the credit of the portfolio Depfa - around 50 billion euros - short - term funds to refinance. 
The hypo Real Estate is financial the need for groups of credit to the foreseeable - covered by this time, and the company is protected by ``before the influence of the international monetary markets to a large extent is currently unable to function``. 
Other resources to hear that, because of this money is to ensure the refinancing of up to the end of the year, 2009. 
The President of HRE Georg funke, on the contrary, he said that the group hypo Real Estate group in the foreseeable future will not have to use monetary markets. 
The Federal Bank and the National Institute for the supervision of financial services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the group hypo Real Estate to ensure that the market is now. 
In this they hope shareholders and creditors of the Bank. 
But with regard to dynamism and nepostižitelnost crisis may not exist the security. 
Even is not completely out of the question that credit should be completely exhausted. 
However, can not exclude or otherwise. 
After the Bank in Sunday late in the afternoon to all stood before the default, can not, even if the provisional, calm rescue passion. 
Rate of shares fell 75 percent of the 3.30 the euro. 
On the contrary, well at rates bonds. 
While the preference debts, virtually t budge, they lose rates secondary bonds significantly. 
This applies to the bond, in particular, the former subsidiary companies württemberg hypo and logically bonds with maturity after 2009. 
Bonds hypo - Real - Estate originally looked like an alternate investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability should after a hardening banking crisis, and the crisis of the Institute, which it in firms had introduced by Depfa, understand depending on the stability of the international financial system. 
As long as the issue of the Bank, governments, and less affected by commercial banks will be willing to support a system, it is possible to reckon with the reimbursement of the securities in their repayment terms. 
It may also but to what it was now almost no one dare to hope - - in the following 15 months will be overcome with the financial crisis. 
But, given the reports coming at the same time with this partial nationalization of the likelihood of bordering with certainty now became a mere the hope. 
In particular the long - term creditors probably prepare a series of sleepless night, when will decide whether their obligations give up. 
Short - term investors may limit the line used to at least it creates the transfer of the losses from previous accounting period to the exchange - rate income of subsequent years for the purpose of future payment of taxes on capital gains. 
Sylvana and secrecy bento - pack 
When he has a 16 - year - old Sylvana Hiltropová the first day of high school in Tačibaně imagine they start with the girls giggling: the German woman is completely ``kawaii``! 
What this means? 
Sylvana this word he knows it from manga. to its new blog on removable stay tells of Japan. 
``on the first day in Japan. 
Lord, I was nervous. 
I of the way to the school was easy call. 
I live on the edge of the Tokyo direction to the Kawasaki and I take 40 minutes by train to the medium in Tačibaně. 
The way I had to find herself, fortunately I was lost. 
It seems that the beginning of the period to the Tačibaně is not given by so strictly, as for us at home in the lower Saxony. 
Students meet, after eight o 'clock, and the twenty minutes before 9 starts with a short sitting with the teacher, the so - called' home room '. 
But even more than started school, I should imagine. 
I 'm not at all I am one of those people who likes to speak before the people, let alone before the class of 40 students. 
Because I still had school uniform, I married to the old skirt their host Mom, the blouse, blue tights and black leather boots. 
As follows dressed, she stood before the bench, and tried to everything properly say: 'Sajónara wo Sha Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I am of Germany, and a week I birthday. 
At that moment I was very glad that I was taught language for two years ago. 
All 31 girls in the class rumors, giggling and waving and I always heard the word 'kawaii'. 
I already knew of their manga. 
Belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival, and the means' charming, sweet '. 
Then I quickly rolled to his place. 
Girl next to me with a wide enough smiled, as a honour that should sit beside her foreign student. 
The rest of the hour was relatively calm, but when he said Gong, literally me covered. 
Talking about one above the other, and giggled and asking me to the possible even impossible - and it is seriously hard to understand the Japanese English. 
During a break then all unwrapped his benta. 
My host my mother said did such a pack on his dinner - - and it is something other than dull German snacks. 
I rice with the herb, small sausage, salad from by number of cucumbers and eyelashes, fruit, and a kind of fish in tofu těstíčku. 
Majority at all, no idea what here in Japan him. 
These things look the strangely and taste quite newly. 
What is certain is that everything is real good. 
Well, perhaps to the slano loaded plums, br! 
Benta to the Japanese schools is not only the dinner. 
Sometimes happens that have girl boy with prepared bento, which is especially in this case academically customized, and hoped that boy at tea to break closer to know. 
Read about it in their manga comics. 
I wondered if it here, I see. 
'why Japan?' asked my friend, when I told them that I want to go to school year in Tokyo. 
Then I always said: 
'What amazes me simply because it.' 
For years, after all, to read the manga. 
And to these comic book and their culture better understood, I began to once a little to teach Japanese. 
It was quite clear to me, that I once I would have to come. 
Because I had a weakness for tradition, customs and habits. 
And you are the high value. 
On the one hand, Japan countries the latest technology and trends, on the other is strict, disciplined and traditional. 
And it is all so well - organized, never I felt lost, even if the Tokyo - largest city, I ever saw. `` 
Even the rats have feelings 
When the black rat juryman; or running away from the danger, it means that also feel fear? 
Neurologist Joseph le doux is believed that even many animals have feelings. 
But how it would be possible to verify whether the feel the same, when behave like we? 
In internet journal ``edge`` have for several years published contributions of known scientists. 
Spiegel online in his series represents the selected answer to the question ``What as true, without you can prove it?`` 
I believe that the animals have feelings, and other states of consciousness, without I or anyone else ever could prove it, when we can prove it nor that account, other people. 
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all of the human brain have the same basic configuration. 
However, as soon as a going to pay any other type of and open questions the perception of or in general consciousness, enter the field because the hardware is, does not match. 
When the rat is in danger, would do the same, what many other animals: will pretend that is dead, breaks or attacking. 
People behave the like of which some scientists deduce to comparable subjective experience. 
In this, however, I believe. 
Two aspects of the migration of our brain structures impeded subjective experience on the experience of the animals. 
This is partly because that circuits associated with the human consciousness almost always include the side the prefrontal kortex (due to its share in the short - term memory and for levy of execution or management:). 
This vast area is in humans developed significantly more than other primates, and it seems that in the case of other creatures missing. 
At least those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal kortexu, between them of knowledge of who we are, and the ability to schedule and decide, there is reason to believe that the man distinguishes a even from other primates. 
More dramatic oddity could hide language nature of man: it is so much of its associated with the perception of the tongue, says is often that consciousness depends on it. 
In this case could be animals exclude. 
But even if the language of matter, of course she language influenced, so that the animal consciousness, whether it is made may however, out of most of the status of the consciousness of our. 
Therefore, it is difficult to see how he looks consciousness for other animals. 
When, as something of the internal and subjective, can 't measure or, because of the special hardware, analyze on the basis of our own experience, put his examination of us before the great problems. 
Most of my pin shall apply to the content of the conscious experience, but in addition is there another aspect of consciousness, which should be scientifically easily accessible. 
It would be possible to processes in the consciousness of the animals to examine regardless of their contents, and precisely what is happening in studies the short - term memory U primates, especially in the example visualizations. 
But this approach, which we Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focus more on neural koreláty consciousness, than to the causal mechanism: both may be identical, but also to are not. 
Interestingly, this approach also underlines the importance of nefrontálního kortexu for implementation visualizations. 
What this means for feelings? 
I draw from that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain of his own activities. 
What indicates as ``fear``, is therefore mental state in which they are found, when activity defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reaction) will use the operating memory. 
Seen from this angle, are feelings closely tied with those areas kortexu which signifies primates, and especially people. 
In connection with the linguistic nature of a fine graduation, because it using the words, and the grammar checker can match and to categorize states that is by themselves, and the second. 
In contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio considers that feelings arise from primitive activities in the areas of the brain stem kortexu and devoted to the physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, but more focus on the brain stem. 
Because this network in the course of human evolution changed too, might be quiet, participate in the sensations the perceived many animal houses. 
Purely in theory, it can not oppose, however, that I consider the unprovable. 
Pankseep argues that what we in rats and people seem fear, may have felt both organisms as well: as but may verify, says further Pankseep, that the rats and people feel the same, when the like behave? 
Swabians against the risk of withdraws - feeling he also fear? 
From my perspective can not only a resemblance behavior prove conformity of experience. 
It is true that neural comparison us moves away: rats and people have similar brain strains cockroaches, by contrast, nor the brain. 
But it is responsible for the feelings brain stem? 
And even if it was not possible to demonstrate in humans: how we wanted to demonstrate in rats? 
I believe that the rats, and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings. 
But are you sure I don 't know what he had to do. 
And because their feelings probably fundamentally different from those of our (for human consciousness is based on the specific circuits and in the language), instead of studying the emotional behavior, than the emotional perception of rats. 
In any case, it shall in that case, we can see the progress of the neural level, where in rats and in people we measured by the same. 
As in rats examined the language and consciousness, examined or feelings, after all, 'I don' t know whether there are. 
It is not considered short - sighted, but the forward, rather than to repeatedly leaping out against the wall.

An obscure street, often forgotten, and perhaps soon for sale 
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other road, some famous, the only other commercial. 
But even many taxis - veterans and of long - serving of local is in difficulties, when they find extra place, mostly because they never heard of him. 
This little aisle is in the area of East village and leads to the north of the first street - without, came to the other street - between the Bowery and the other Avenue. 
The width of about ten, and the length of the forty feet of the dust - covered, rather than the traffic moves. 
There are no signpost with the names of the streets. 
In the ordinary course of Atlas is practically invisible. 
However, the aisle admirer. 
For example, the firm developera Avalon Bay, recently built luxury of buildings on the street. 
He wants to extra place newly pave and create a cleaner passage to the business, and from boutiques, which in the new buildings have open. 
Other admirer are long time neighbors who say that they were contracted the lane fascinated simply because it was one of the last vestiges of from the time he was processed block. 
But the urban authority for the protection and development of such, which has the street in their power, has no interest in her hold. 
At the meeting of the land of the Committee of the village of the Community and of the representatives of the outline of the urban Avalon bay plan, under which should developer street buy.

Some local, including blogger, who wrote about the processing area of East Village, opposition to the idea of the sale of extra place and claims that the piece of public assets, albeit limited, should the public remain. 
Others consider extra place for oddity - almost unchanged a little town, which should be left to as is. 
Jeremiah Moss, who writes blog name Jeremiášův fade New York (with the book: ``laments: bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction``), (posted part of the story of extra place of headings consider city, which appeared in the newspaper The New Yorker in 1952. 
Author Article, Brendan gill, wrote: ``extra place is narrow blind alley, dark and bordered by day and rusty iron gates stores and zatlučenými windows, where in ditches and week old newspapers.`` 
Only a few exceptions looked aisle one recent evening quite as well. 
Rat was over a blank end of the street near the door, which had led to CBGB on whose place today a trade with expensive clothes. 
It was graffiti on the walls, and next to the fresh benefits discarded papers lay the empty bottle of beer. 
Few people said that on the extra place thought, but seldom has proposed that he could throw a exhilaration. 
By contrast, Fields said he thought that some people underestimate the persuasive effects of aisle in its current state. 
``the best years of my life,`` he said, ``they were in the places the dark, wet and odious.`` 
The debate about bilingvalitě: immersion to English 
In this issue of the headings focus on education will be Bruce Fuller and Lance t. Izumi discuss the position of candidates to bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, academic worker from kalifornistiky and director of the field of education in the organization of the Pacific Research Institute for public policy, is the co - author of ``worse than you think: why middle class needs to collect school.`` 
To address effectively the Hispanic voters is a tricky business. 
Barack Obama ’ s educational agenda that just proves. 
Obamova campaign says that ``African - American and Hispanic students have significantly lower probability that he, than white pupils,`` which is true. 
With such differences struggled to performance, promotes Obamova educational agenda in particular, inter alia, ``transitional bilingual education`` for those who English only taught. 
The question on Baracka Obamu, indeed, remains whether its commitment to the bilingual education, which emphasizes that, in order to use the languages in the class other than English, is stronger than his interest in reducing the performance of the differences. 
Consider Sixth Street Preproduction, charter elementary school in Los Angeles County East. 
Žáci this schools are in most cases Hispanic of low - income families. 
More than one - third of students, many of which came only recently, the English only taught. 
And yet in state tests of mathematics in 2008 received at the top level of a tremendous 100 percent of the fourth of the pupils. 
Almost as marvellous ninety - three percent of the pupils fourth classes were given to the highest level in state tests of the English language and literature. 
This success incredible was reached, than any other method which prefers Obama. 
Sixth Street emphasizing control and training session, the constant of the assessment of skills and access no excuses. 
Furthermore, and the Obama had noted, is under the Linda Mikelsové, director Sixth Street, the pedagogic access school for those who English only learning, ``full immersion``. 
Immersion in English underlines the almost privileged the use of English in teaching. 
Miss Mikelsová, which is against bilingual education, she said to me: ``We had a huge success with one entirely new a pupil of Mexico - after 12 months you entered in the class and they knew that it is.`` 
``it works,`` she said, ``for us it works.`` 
He took the Obama school as Sixth Street Preproduction for model, how should look more school with large shares of the Hispanic and English, the training of pupils? 
The results, which at school, should of answer to this question make granted, but the educational agenda of his own party (national education association is a longtime champion of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education znejasňují predicting Obamovy answers. 
While Obama agrees that immigrants had to learn English, recently thing trivialized, when he said that people should stop to worry with ``only English`` laws. 
Instead, ``you should ensure that your children to talk Spanish,`` he said. 
If Obama really wants to delete Performance differences, it should be more a educational models, which operate, carefully think, than to gloat at them and trivialized is.

Oil prices fall sharply Monday because of fears that neither the US plan to the rescue of financial markets would need to boost the economy.

``We think that will not be able to infection escape. 
From the perspective of the commodity is our greatest concern, to what extent the U. S. virus spread to the rest of the world, and in particular to China. `` 
Analysts of this bank scaled back their expectations for the next year, as the oil consumption dropped due to slow growth of the economy, and reduced their forecasts of gasoline prices to 2009 of about 20%. 
Wild ride in the second quarter of the team reached record 
After he had spent in uniform Jets for the last eight seasons more than anyone else, a defensive Player Shaun Ellis thought he saw everything. 
Then in Sunday followed the development of the second quarters in which Jets turned bezbodovou game in that journey. 
``I never saw nothing of the sort,`` he said Ellis. 
The second quarter of began after Jets and Arizona Cardinals a dull up his game of the clouds over him. 
Then quarterback Brett Favre he sent Laveranuese Colese to dvanáctiyardový touchdownový sprint, thereby Friday prompted an afternoon in which their gradually developing cooperation moved on miles ahead. 
Favre Colese sent in that quarter of for two other touchdowny, including, in which he fell cornerback, and the next 10 seconds before half struggle. 
``it was anything extraordinary,`` said the Favre of all its pass Colesovi. 
``It is very good player. 
Communicate with us good, whatever people think anything. `` 
While the Coles Favre and tossed it struck quarterbacka Cardinals, the defense of Kurt Warner. 
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught no hours and returned to 32 yards to the touchdown. 
Safety Eric Smith vytipoval other pass and grabbed it. 
Linebacker David Bowens forced to fumblu Warner. 
The last loss of the ball, fumble, which forced Bowens, was perhaps the best at all. 
The team Cardinals came to the 10 seconds before the end of, and after Jets have ball back, kicked Jay Feely dvacetiyardový goal of the field, which gained the 34 - 0. 
This is what most, when Jets have obtained in one quarter. 
Jets Coach Eric Mangini, when he was invited to a madness described, he said: ``the second quarter, or third - quarter of?`` 
When he was told, that both - Jets to permit in the third quarter of 21 points without answers - Mangini said: ``I can say that the second - quarter of I have much more than the third. 
Fell many points in a short period of time. `` 
More rested Gebreselassie improved its world record 
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia showed once again, why not many regarded the best of long - distance runners at all, when in the Sunday in Berlin Marathon overcame his own world record and became the first person to run over 26.2 miles long plant under two hours and four minutes. 
Victory on the pleasant flat line in time 2: 03: 59 roll straight over on 27 seconds its previous time 2: 04: 26, he ran last year in Berlin. 
Gebreselassie, 35, created by 26. world record of his career, which is actually extraordinarily broad - exceeded the world record or is at least a master of the world on all the distance from the metric miles after Marathon. 
Last month Gebreselassie Olympic Marathon out in Beijing, terrified to - of rear - view, perhaps too fearfully - that atmospheric pollution rozdráždí his problems with asthma. 
Instead, he promised that run in Berlin. 
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees to the startup, 55 degrees in the objectives - won Sunday Gebreselassie with brief diameter 4 minutes and 43 seconds a mile. 
What is the block runners as Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on the longer tracks, fell maratónský record in the last decade of more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil had won in Berlin in time 2: 06: 05 in 1998. 
After Sunday victory said Gebreselassie journalists, that he had two weeks ago convulsions in his calf out and week of training. 
Pause him rather than clearly nabudila delay. 
``I am so happy,`` he said Gebreselassie reporters. 
``everything was perfect. 
Before the week I started again, and I was now a little in doubt, but all was well. `` 
He was also criticized by - mainly in Kenya, East African rival Ethiopia - because of this, he overly planned to their plants, generally he shunned world maratónským betters, relied on the wire, as if it was a race to track, and built world record above the sense of competition. 
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassieho huge running quality. 
Kept pace of the four Keňany has reached Gebreselassie half in time 1: 02: 04. 
After the conductors, constantly Gebreselassieho fell away and two elite Kenya runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi. 
Something earlier than three miles before the aim of Gebreselassie as last sold well and escaped Kwambaiovi, who then he came to the second place in time 2: 05: 36 and improve their personal maximum of almost five minutes. 
Kamathi finished third in time 2: 07: 48. 
In the establishment of women capped a year on the seventh rapid time history 2: 19: 19 Irina Mikitěnková, rodačka from Kazakhstan, which is now the citizeness Germany. 
The record time 2: 15: 25 holds Paula Radcliffová from Britain. 
36 - year - old Mikitěnková surprisingly won last spring in the London Marathon in time 2: 24: 14. 
Beijing's games missed for what, described as of back injury, but recovered, and won in Berlin and in the third Marathon, who ran, when improved their personal maximum of almost five minutes. 
Run plant clever and coherently: left escape four and a large Kenya ’ s runner Ethiopic advantage and then after about 18 ½ miles carry. 
Askale Tafa Magarsaová of Ethiopia reached in second 2: 21: 31 and Helene Kipropová from Kenya came third in time 2: 25: 01. 
Pride and obstacles to the life of blacks in separate city 
Hidden between rozlezlými entertainment parks more Orlando, a few miles from the noisy and that shined, a gigantic, lie quiet city in which mitigate pride and the complexity of African American life. 
Eatonville, the first completely black city that it has been incorporated into the State and where Zora Neal Hurstonová spent his childhood, it is not as simple as describe him in 1935: ``city of five lakes, three kroketových playgrounds, three hundred brown skin, three hundred good sailors, out of kvajávy, two schools and any prison.`` 
Now it is a site. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee they came to the annual eatonvillský festival Zora! to take an bow Hurstonové, most famous women's writer harlemské Renaissance. 
The city, which described, remains a party, and when he did stop for tourists by included in Florida tourist the wizard - created Federal Writers project of economic crisis. 
It is still so independent, dignified and private, as it was in the 1930 s, when Hurstonová wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist and share their actual feelings with white man, who ``so few of us knew that he did not know what comes.`` 
And now, in the year that black presidential candidate, Sen. Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion about the race, remain the residents to many cautious view of foreign. 
``We are the great attention to it, as is our tale is told,`` says 59letá Hortense Jones, who lives here since birth, and is a member of the oldest parish in the city. 
``It must be properly.`` 
Eatonville has long been portrayed as the paradox of triumph, and effort. 
That is both historical model black the rise and community almost 2400 people, where the poverty rate double from the national average. 
Is the literature, but also the oaks shielded example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes, sometimes opovrhované for - formed from the U. S. slavery. 
Not surprisingly, whereas the residents are both pride and protectionist. 
And worried about the idea Eatonvillu began to the Zorou indeed, which is the only way here Hurstonové says. 
Introduced the world through his hometown cordial books full jargon of as ``Mules and men (mules and men)`` (1935) and (``their eyes Were Watching God (their eyes followed God)`` (1937). 
Five paragraphs Florida tourist changed little way to the city of road No 17, which leads through often pomíjené center of Florida, in a black - stage history and human drama. 
With the great cylinder razancí in life and in literature introduced Hurstonová readers to trade of the first eatonvillského mayor of Joe Clark, and then turned to the personal sites. 
``left beside the road,`` she wrote, ``is a white ornamented with brown modern national school with well - kept courts and the field, which is always the old Howard Miller, even if the power can 't read or write.`` 
Also cited a new husband widows Dashové and wrote that Lee Glenn ``sells beverages of all kinds and never anything fit into a one - hour hotel.`` 
So in just a few hundreds of words link Hurstonová Eatonville, the Authority, but also with illiteracy, znovuuzavíraním marriages and sex. 
This clearly not typical PublisherName Fodor 's. 
In fact, it was not portrait, all appreciative. 
``Zora that she said so, as it was,`` says devadesátiletá Ella Dinkinsová, one of the first of the girls who Hurstonová has made mortal by it quoted men who on their beauty of a low sang songs. 
``Some people didn 't like that,`` she added. 
On the Hurstonovou is still there he recalls as the active výstřednici, which often returned after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville. 
Sedmasedmdesátiletý Augustus Franklin recalls that the majority, as to the city of a, without notification arrived in a Chevrolet, smoking and wear trousers in town, which is now proud to the dignified dress. 
The majority of the population was fascinated by, said Franklin, but many reasons. 
``People zoru always like to see you,`` he said Franklin. 
But, he added, dangling in the chair on the back of the terrace with a view to the lake Sabelia, where Hurstonová was most likely baptized, ``never was too long.`` 
When Hurstonová 1960 died, poor, and her books have been dropped from printing. 
It seemed to her Eatonville, together with the rest of the world forgotten. 
Although it was once the literary star, současnicí Langston Hughes, and the only blacks to Barnard college in the 1920 s of the 20 th century, was buried in an unmarked grave in Florida Fort Pierce, where he lived. 
There were no more in Eatonvillu memorial ceremony or large public reading. 
``I think the or its importance for the world, or its reference understand at all,`` she said Valerie Boydová, author of the biography Hurstonové ``style in Rainbows (packaged in rainbow)% quot% issued in 2003. 
Change came in the 1980 s. 
Officials of the county of Orange County trying to squeeze through the city of pětiproudou &amp; amp; bopt; in place of the Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local / main roads. 
Rozlézání Orlando it through interstate highway No 4 through the western edge of the town. 
Proposal from came at a time when Eatonville was still of a complicated historical period. 
The integration of the compulsory exploitation right, together with other things, ended the relatively for isolation of the community. 
In the 1950 s brought a fight about the stirring of hate RAS to the edge of the community. 
``in that time, the crew of white boys, they came and throw oranges and things to the people who were sitting on the side,`` he said Franklin. 
``indeed, we had a lady that this killed. 
They dumped of the car melon. `` 
In a letter to the journal Orlando Sentinel from 1955 Hurstonová questioned the request of the Supreme Court to the integration of the compulsory exploitation right, and of his decision in the case of brown against the chamber for the education, said it is ``for my race of offensive rather than celebrating.`` 
The people of now says that desegregace schools, even if it was in some areas of positive, reduced in Eatonvillu cohesion and has undermined the courage to the youth. 
``black children have been accustomed to embrace - I remember it - you have embraced his teacher in the morning, you have embraced his teacher in the evening,`` she said N. Y. Nathiriová, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non - profit - making of the group Preserve the Eatonville Community (save Eatonvillskou community). 
It took until the students and teachers were descended from the same place, she added. 
``round his white teacher because your white teacher - I want to say that there is a cultural barrier,`` said Miss Nathiriová. 
However, the civil rights helped create space for many other Zory Neal Hurstonové - black writer, actors and artists, who, as she rose above the prejudices lighter with self - assurance and quotations as, for example, ``as a man may deny pleasure of my presence! 
I understand. `` 
In 1975 had wandered Alice Walker to the grave Hurstonové and began to fight for reviving its reputation. 
Five years later he came to the shelf in bookstores for Hurstonové biography of Robert e. Hemenwaye, who, in the U. S. canon again. 
A project with the motorway arrived just when the most famous daughter Eatonvillu light again found a ramp. 
Former neighbors Hurstonové her now regarded as spasitelku. 
In order to show what can become his the motorway destroy, began to community in 1988 to plan festival Hurstonové. 
Thousands of fans inaugural action up to two years later, and each January, many to a return. 
State after several years of highway draft stepped back. 
``the five streams restores the highway, said directly exploded, the real civil pride,`` she said Nathiriová. 
Boydová it said simply: ``Zora Eatonville saved.`` 
Victory over the project of highway helped to change the image of the town. 
An as Rachelle Munson, lawyers, which began to walk into this part of the church in 1993, began to appear in the greater number of people, and began to reconsider past. 
Eatonville joined national registry historical in 1998. 
New, two - story library (named after Hurstonové), of course, was opened in 2006 to vyasfaltovaném again and with Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today remains Eatonville Florida's of anomalies: only six miles from the center of Orlando may sometimes act as - aisle in summer rain, so small, as if he was based with only 27 black families in the 1980 s, the 19 th century. 
- LRB - today 90 percent of the Black.) 
With strangers who go find story and the importance of Eatonvillu, is still often treated carefully. 
Authorization for most of the talks, it is necessary to have in advance and certain things - - as the mural in the oldest eatonvillském church, painted whites and blacks which appear on the field may not be snapping pictures. 
Many in Eatonvillu, as Jones, bold, a teacher, poised to like to deep red, still fear that their isolated community will not understand. 
And even as the festival Hurstonové increase, also increased domestic pride. 
Especially young people gravitate to see Eatonville as Hurstonová I saw my race: a beautiful, with problems, and so, but not better, no worse, and as the proud, creative, hard, foolish and heterogeneous as other American race and ethnicity. 
From the voice, Franklin nephew, of an 18 - year old Edwin Harvey, honest - the love of the community, and when he plans to return to the Eatonvillu after high school, to work in local government or the police, which says that used some help. 
And even younger, such as the 11 - year - old twins of Winter Park Alondra and of Alexius Kenonovy, it seems, have learned to describe Eatonville properly. 
``Most people, only when this way left, he thought: 'Oh, that the city is nothing to the other,'`` said Alondra Kenyon, recently in Sunday after church. 
``But if you really stop and looked at the moment to history, it is very good of the city.`` 
Here in New York are we talking all finančsky fluent 
At first glance, that nothing. 
If the tourists in Manhattan keeping away from the newsagent and the television screens to the Times Square, would realize that they stood in the middle of the storm. 
I would guess that the window in the hive bee offices over their heads have each day of bankers and managers of investment funds, who monopolized New York, the worst ``bad day at the office`` from crisis of 1929. 
Messengers still crashing metal carts after the sidewalks and carry pekáče muffinů to breakfast meeting. 
Still the Hispanic transferred between the high - rises and wear, as human mules, 50 ironed shirt hanging from outriggers, which in their back. 
Paper shufflers are still waiting in the queue to its morning bagel street stands for the menu, and he could not get in the weekday yellow taxi from four to seven in the afternoon. 
It didn 't seem as a crisis, until I was, with all the talk of pessimism, decided to establish Thursday afternoon savings account. 
And yet, that I was time this task to coincided with the late afternoon siestou on my local branch JP Morgan chase, there was waiting in the queue about 20 people. 
No before the Treasury windows to lifted up or save cash, but before the bulkhead, where the older clients ordering checkbooks, tourists wonder on the path to the trade of goods Macy 's and new customers based accounts. 
Most of the people in front of me, I learned from Starr, my ``of the licensed of personal banker``, come from the same reasons as I. 
But I don 't you selected from their savings of smaller banks in places, whence they came, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten island. 
Select the money from the so - called thriftů (a little similar construction the savings bank), (cash associations and of those types of thrifts, whose branches operate in only one State, and which claims that is on your customers care as a family. 
In the past year 15 of such Bank quietly to go bankrupt. 
Until a few days go Washington Mutual, the Bank of assets for 327 billion, into bankruptcy, and when, New Yorkers headed home to weekend on Friday night, she tried to other bank, Wachovia, with assets for 440 billion, caught rescue buyers. 
Servants of offices and trade, who were standing in front of me, and they feared the next collapse, move his cash to the bank, which is seen as the safe harbor and who does most saving a on Wall Street. 
Ordinary New Yorkers in the last week to fluent in finančsky. 
A woman in my local supermarket Chinese spoke to the phone and convey to the Lehman Borthers, that the failed bank, and to her thin the chief executive Dick Fuldovi with such familiárností, as if the lazy calf colleague. 
And unperturbed, uniformed roughly 50 - year - old domovnice my apartment house, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - chin, Angelina or my delivery of foodstuffs. 
After my visit in bank she said to me: ``I have now their savings in the money - market funds. 
Move it, I will not risk it. ``

Staff members nasprejovali on some of the graves of Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, but they are convinced that it might be an attempt to zamaskování themes of extremists led by hatred of the Muslim immigrants. 
It is not clear whether, the incident however linked to the election. 
A spokesman for the Islamic community said that are ``deeply shocked`` messages on the desecration, which comes at a time when it is close to the end of the Muslim postní month Ramadan. 
Austria, meanwhile, enter the wheels searching for own soul, after right in the swing of yesterday's parliamentary elections.

``to catch the actual nature, fotím Master outside the scene Günther Bauer - photographer.`` 
No heels, no called or costumes. 
Only essences of large masters flamenca, odpoutaných from the focus on the interpretation - only so achieve the expression of the man or woman. 
On one side of the artist. 
On the other - - man. 
Inseparable, aside from the privacy, in those moments far from the audience - then can be seen confidential gesture, passing the depth of the index view or a passionate body language hands, which are carefree, because they are not about to get up on the scene. 
The German Günther Bauer changes in ``flamenco - people`` theatricality withdrawal, singers, dancer and guitar players with the less familiar face masters. 
With this aim photographer prepares a unique iconography flamenca from different environment. 
The exhibition, which takes place in the framework of the months photos flamenca (% quot% MES% quot% de la Fotografía flamenca), ``reflects the growing international importance flamenca``, says author and explains that ``flamenco - people`` ``may not be any people, but when you look at the photographs, you find that you are not a typical pictures of artists on the scene. 
These people portrétovaní ``on the street`` are artists to scene transfer passion, sadness, glad... and fully seize the spectators. 
To track the personality of these artists is not necessary to fotit on stage. 
Wear their personality and the nature of the inside. 
I wondered create released the atmosphere, which don 't allow you to catch up personality flamenca men living could. 
Fascinated festival ``canty de las Minas`` began Bauer in 1997, a long way portrétování flamencových singers, guitarist and dancers on board the camera. 
These are the portraits of which, because of the selection of a camera and material recall the classic photo. 
The application of different stylistic resources is in contrast with the classical basis of slide and lend it the current spirit, which is the idea that under the mirrors Bauer and flamenco: ``music with very traditional roots, which but continues to be surprised and develop.`` 
What's the spectators, not the action of the dance, sing or games, but personality and the nature of the artist. 
The search for a moment when we with that the most important, with the spirit of that manifest in the perception of being and experience, it was and is constant work as presented during these days in the gallery EL Fotómata. 
This selection almost seventy - photographed performers formed by a well - known figure flamenca, such as inter alia Diego EL Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosová, Enrique Morente, el Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amiga. 
The project has become a kind of omnibus flamenca and soon to find book issue, which will include posted portraits. 
Passion for portrétování had brought the two years ago Bauer to the idea of an idea again to the ``portrait sporting veteran`` (``SportARTproject``). 
Although it is their draft from ``flamenco - people`` distinct, photographer admits, ``I fotit people know, is, and have the option to the moment, whether longer or only brief, enter into their lives - - it is my passion. 
I think that in a photo of the portrait of the most difficult genre.

America without Paul Newman had so much to don 't like the 
``sometimes God made perfect people. 
Paul Newman was one of them. `` 
These are the words actress Sally Fieldové, which with him without intention to cooperate in ``evil`` and under the weight of the knowledge that he had gone, reveals a remedy abandoned his vision of the U. S. cinema and an America. 
Look, as it was, than he had an Oscar. 
And that was retired from the year 2007. 
And that was known to be very sick. 
Still, for all chlapák. 
``sometimes it, one feels, what can not make any way, and I am now lost large friend,`` he said, in tears Robert Redford, ``my life and my country were thanks to him better.`` 
No one shall be afraid that will be ridiculous or exaggerate. 
Film and the country's father died in particularly dark time fear of terrorists and of financial markets, at the time that is America ’ s self - confidence in the bottom, when the desperately searching for reasons to pride. 
If the period is the harsh and people without a combination of virtues, and only a handful of those who they are worth admiration - need not be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
For all the kind embodied in almost platonický ideal shape and the truth. 
It was the official opponents of Richard Nixon and fighter for a lost and won cases, from the Foundation against drug addiction based on the honour of first - born son, who died at the overdoses, after the custom domestic food and biopotravin. 
Full treasure, for the country were many efforts to move away from the suicide catering culture. 
Wave of admiration turbulent flooded Hollywood irrespective of the nationality or nationality. 
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, said that he did not die, one man, but the one era. 
Another Englishman, the holder of an Oscar for directing Sam Mendes, said that the work with Newman was all without the peak of his career. 
Bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, ventured Newman mark for its largest source of inspiration. 
``the Dodger us all put on a high standard,`` says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has in today ’ s the time of the courage to try to live as he lived Paul Newman - based on the honesty and leads the serious private life far from the cameras. 
It is not in today ’ s media the jungle always slight, sometimes even possible. 
But, fortunately, such people are and Paul Newman is their model. 
Divorced her once, and from that time has been married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, which he was faithful, though he was certainly more than enough opportunities. 
``why I went out to the hamburger, when I have at home?`` he fillets joke. 
Let him in heaven, attended by the pride that ruled the country interplay between his daughters and obdivovatelkami - in America it too common is not. 
It is said that, ``of all the major role impersonate, he was proud to the role of loyal husband, loving father, willing grandfather and dedicated philanthropist``. 
Imperfect plants Olympic Madrid 
Yes, many of us want to the Olympics, to be held in Madrid, and after mulling 2012, it will be possible 2016. 
But I ask: we are ready? 
If we manage yesterday's plant, so I say: No! 
It was on him as if he was a perfect race, and to my court was the worst, on which I ever was. 
Such a variety of nonsense that immediately, if he was the evaluation and I was the investigator would be a clear insufficient. 
But look at it from the beginning, nice one after the other. 
Nonsense start with raising racing numbers, for which a man must start before. 
I don 't like it bad, but when he man respect, whether they give him the all (including chip to avoid overfill condition track). 
But not. 
Here the first man had to pick up the number (the first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after vystání proper queue) - what surprise! - had only a T - shirt size with (second nonsense, because I want the size of the XL). 
Where that we live? 
This was due to a crisis decided to buy T - shirts, only small because it is less substances and are cheaper? 
Well, that are, however, trivia compared with what happened in the race day. 
In addition, it must go very early for chip and the queue to it took over 15 minutes, there had to be given to pack. 
Over 35 minutes took waiting time, which is to a plant, where he expects 11.000 people, something understandable. 
So, as was to be expected, race, and we began to postpone still packs, and now, it could, with raising it was much worse. 
Waiting, in addition, the 40 minutes, extended the rain, which led to widespread revolt and attack on the cab. 
I believe that the 500 of us will have a tomorrow an attack of bronchitis and some, like me, in good time in the evaluation of the results because of chip, who gave me, and which, as I suppose, make me properly time startup. 
Of course, that if someone asked me to a perfect race, this would not attack me. 
And so I believe that we will have to set up a well Olympic city of only have dreamed. 
Microsoft search the receptionist (virtual) 
The Conference on new technologies mit demonstrated the Microsoft further developments in the new system, the recognition of image and human interaction of the method of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to carry out the basic acts as to bring up the taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, boy, who would be moving around the range of companies) and (forget what he heard in an interview. 
Thanks to the camera and the system, which detects shapes and face, this can ``the receptionist`` know how many people is in the room, who are the - even to remember what they are - and listen and understand the key words of their talks. 
Can also present in accordance with the option chat rooms. 
On the receptionist Demonstration video is a third person and understand that do not belong to a group, which with her speak, and that it is not the staff member of society. 
Asks whether for someone respect, and shall communicate her that her for a moment it will pay. 
All of this without blue screen of death. 
The wonderful. 
But this is, of course, the music of the future. 
Currently, the company has more important things to do, for example, a new version of the Windows operating system. 
This week more talk of a change in Microsoft strategy. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and not have as much associated programs. 
Steve Ballmer came to that, should the computer should only necessary, without of ballast of commercial inadequate, they would be five times more powerful - Man, Steve, it will be cheaper. 
The discovery of like thunder, when given that Microsoft version from the version of the add new Windows features, and other% quot% Extra% quot%. 
Change in the direction of the grateful labours offence. 
Microsoft is right, the operating system slowly lose meaning and the like the software. 
When he came to the Google chromium, I became one of those who favor the theory that it was the first step Googlu to competition with Windows. 
Many rightly pointed to the browser is not the operating system. 
The operating system will always be required, it is necessary layer to understanding between the hardware and software. 
Has the same function as your wife or your man, when you say something mother - in - law. 
It is true. 
Never disappears, but it is the need to think of getting ``death`` of the operating system not as to an absolute right, but to the right of relative. 
What he said this week Ballmer, this idea of confirmed. 
People pay increasingly less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, more Internet browser. 
Your computer is turns on that started Firefox or Explorer - or chromium - and each day spent more time on the Internet than around the windows. 
What is used half of the applications, covering the system? 
Less is more. 
And Windows 7 shall not be less, much less than the vista. 
Less difficult, less loaded, less complex. 
Microsoft has now interest to offer their services on - line, and at last the State alternative to Googlu. 
Desperately he need and here I have little example. 
This picture, I made in one rest rooms for employee Microsoft in Redmond at the beginning of the month. 
To pay beverage was the poster, which is requested to use their search tools: ``your search. our future.`` 
In 2006 has shown an independent studies that 66% of workers using Microsoft to search on the Internet Google. 
Last week, by the way confirmed the delays in a new version of the Windows Mobile 7. 
Not come at the beginning of the year, 2009, but in the end, I 'd like to do so in 2010. 
In Microsoft will endeavour to place on the market of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together. 
The phone is becoming more computer. 
Whereas the android and iPhone are already on the market, will have to pay dearly for the delay.

Speaking of sleep 
Some of the children in the night talk. 
I don 't think those wake up and Chile tell us what happened to the day before, but the children, which speaks, while the sleep. 
When this happens for the first time, perhaps you scary, but in fact it is irrelevant. 
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilokvie. 
The total frequent, in particular for children and young people. 
Certainly many of you told that, in the night he spoke of sleep. 
This phenomenon may contain very sporadicky (for example, once a life at high fevers), or with greater regularity (each day, once a week, once a few months...), the following day the child nothing does not remember. 
There is only one reason that the emergence of he explained. 
Often associated with the other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night nightmare, enuresis nocturna (night - pomočování) or náměsíčnost, but this is not necessarily. 
As previously mentioned, often may be accompanied by a very high fevers, stress or finer situation. 
In any case, it is a little known phenomenon. 
Intensity, with what appears, it is also the different. 
The child can talk in a calm voice, say the individual words, the whisper, or on the contrary (cries, tears, long speeches...). 
In cases where the effect with great strength, it would be appropriate to observe and child consult with experts, in order to ensure that does not have a problem, which causes for him great anxiety, and this way is shown. 
We said that this is a harmless disorder, therefore, only if the untreated, associates to other failure of sleep, which can be treated with (for example, if the associated with apnea syndrome, or with permanent stress). 
But can you make that we have in mind some very simple preventive measures, such as: 
To try to child too exciting, before the goes to sleep. 
Search thus quiet games and avoid the ghost - or rather violent television programmes or series. 
In the case of very nervních children and those which can work with free, it is possible to use a relaxation techniques, which will help to get a specific internal calm. 
The child to a quieter sleep. 
When will appear somnilokvie, try to keep the peace. 
Remind you that it is for the child harmless, and that of what happened, the second day will no longer be nothing to remember. 
Useful of the Council 
Don 't be him. 
It is useless, because it is not in the knowledge and break the him sleep. 
Although he speaks, sleep, and thus he rested. 
Remember, it seems that if you several times, that the very the matter, it would be appropriate to turn on the Council or determine what on child incites such anxiety. 
If you understand what he says (which is not so normal), avoid the temptation to hear it, and pull of information. 
You will not be no good, because when he is asleep, is not in the knowledge, to arrange his thoughts. 
In addition, you have you hear what he says, but you don 't know what he was thinking, and thus why it says, so he put the great caution, as interpreted information and for what conclusions is. 
Never says child that he was in the night to questions on his secret. 
Neither of the fun. 
This raises the great anxiety. 
Don 't do it in short worry, it is nothing wrong, it is only the episode, which has lasted only a few minutes. 
At last Illhaeusern... 
Illhaeusern at last, after a long skinny period again he found the way to victory. 
Without a particularly large struggle, žlutočerní create more opportunities and could one of them in triumph turn. 
The game had during this encounter, in which the invaders hard to put forward, too fast pace. 
After the first trying Captain hosts Kauffmanna darting from afar, only just missed the connector, with a slightly towards the top Illhaeusern and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne through the air, Romaine on the long leg or also Diebold gradually came to defend the Dannemarie. 
Contemporary, by contrast, he built in half of the playground defense Val and on the tip of the attack kept an agile Riahiho only. 
The start of the second half he appeared as the decisive, and this first chance due to two Dannemarie with the names of the Riahi Temporale and, subsequently, after the opening of the score for Illhaeusern, which provide Marais, well situated for the processing of the ball reflected after the previous Dieboldově trying (53 '). 
Gólman Illhaeusernu shall, however, the joy of enjoying a long time, about after 12 minutes was forced to return to changing rooms and leave as his teammates in weakening. 
However, Dannemarie from that he could not extract and eleven of Illhaeusern, only a little withdrew to ``dryness`` defense, already caused no major problems, with the exception of the very last seconds struggle, when the ball after great confusion he swept through the very near the bars.

Chat - blood which is a again 
Héma - Quebec achieved yesterday the tenth anniversary of establishing and its president, Dr. Francine Décaryová rightfully, said, because the Héma - Quebec became one of the most reliable and efficient suppliers of blood in the world. 
In particular, again won the trust of the public, which was after the scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980 s and 1990 s badly shaken. 
It is widely known, the national reserve of blood transfusion managed Canadian Service of the Red Cross was during the 1980 s immune deficience contaminated by a virus (HIV virus) and hepatitis C. 
Whereas this drama and wave of indignation began to the public of the Canadian government in February 1994 public subject to any form of inquiry, who chaired the judge, Horace Krever and to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and formulate recommendations for such disaster already again. 
While the judge Krever hesitated with the disposal of the message, some of the province by listing in the course of the Committee, which sought to schedule a new system management of blood in Canada. 
This task in Quebec interfere Gélineaův Committee. 
After Gélineauově and Kreverově message were in Canada established two suppliers: Héma - Quebec, who had managed Quebec, and Canadian blood company for supply of all the provinces and both areas. 
% quot% in 1998, when Héma - Quebec began its activities, as soon as 38% of people should have more confidence in Quebec blood system, ``says Dr. Décaryová. 
``situation was depressing. 
Systematic effort to enhance the safety of blood products and sustained work in that area during the following years we have to obtain public confidence, ``says and proudly adds that the beginning of the year 2008 Héma - Quebec trust already near Quebec 94% of the population. 
Dr. Décaryová however must bear in mind that ``the confidence is something very fragile``. 
Since its founding 28 September 1998 Héma - Quebec applied the precautionary principle. 
``if we were in Europe witnesses of many cases of human forms of mad cow disease, new variant of the disease called of Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease,`` says the woman, which the company results from its inception in 1998. 
``and we knew that this disease may spread the blood. 
We therefore they based on one of the fundamental recommendations Kreverovy and Gélineauovy messages, under which, in the case of when we don ’ t know, and when it is at stake the spread of serious illness, in this case of Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease, characterised by degeneration brain inevitably leading up to death, it is necessary to adopt excluding measures. 
In April 1999 were therefore rejected the blood from people who since 1980 stayed in the United Kingdom for a period longer than one month. 
A few years ago, it was safely demonstrated that this illness blood transfers. 
This episode so we showed that hold the precautionary principle should sense. `` 
In 1999, in the market appeared much more accurate method for the detection of HIV: tests with the use of nucleic acid (NAT), which make it possible to detect in the donor blood directly the presence of virus itself, and not the presence of antibodies on which were based tests used before. 
NAT tests to enable the vacant shorten the period that occurs between infected moment of patient and the moment when the may be our techniques in the blood revealed the first viruses, explains specialist. 
This period can be reduced to less than a week. 
We were significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be contaminated, without knew about this and without the could come. 
This improvements to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS by blood transfusion. 
The risk that gets the blood of contaminated with HIV, is now issued a man from 12 million. 
``In other words, it means that than anyone infected with HIV, it will be necessary to distribute 12 million of blood products. 
Whereas Héma - Quebec distributes 400.000 annually to 500.000 of blood products, it will be necessary to 24 years, than the appearance of the first case the transmission of HIV through blood products. 
I have considered that can now in profound repose get or prescribe - blood transfusion necessary for recovery, ``says Secretary of leadership Héma - Quebec. 
``the challenge for the next decade we the maintenance of the safety of our products. 
Never know what disease element may appear in the system. 
Just last year on the island of Réunion appeared chikungunya virus, which is similar to the virus West Nile transfers to the blood of insect bites. 
It should be constantly wary, ``continued Dr. Décaryová and stresses that, in addition to the safe of supply must Héma - Quebec also supply count is sufficient. 
``necessary, grow, as its population ages. 
As a result of treatment need more aggressive cancer patients often new dose of red blood cells or of platelets. 
Aging populations also has implications for the site of donors of blood, which shall be in diameter consist only of 3% Québečanů permitted to donation. `` 
Each healthy person at least 18 years old, corresponding to the criteria for the admissibility of, but can donate blood only once a 56 days, this means six times a year. 
14% of people offering the blood is not received in diameter, because they are, for example, by the rightholders of AIDS or malaria, and if they visited the country, where was acting up bahenní chills, are excluded for one year. 
``with these 3% we can keep the status of which corresponds to the needs of hospitals. 
Deficiencies are very rare. 
The members of the network of donors, however, it is necessary to supplement in proportion, as they age and already can not to give blood. 
But persuade people to make blood, it is difficult to, in particular, it keep and spur, to become regular donors. 
Life is now so unfettered, that he hardly ever find an hour to donate blood, ``said Francine Décaryová. 
With the annual budget of 297 million Héma - Quebec adds not only the blood products, but also human tissue, as a bone transplants, heart valve, the eyeball, and the skin, which is almost exclusively used to large burns. 
The following tissues are to be analysed, processed, frozen, before they are deposited with Héma - Quebec, who also manages the only public bank of blood from the umbilical cord in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical endowment of waste, the blood of rich to stem cells, which may be used for the treatment of serious diseases, such as of leukemia. 
``A few weeks we celebrate deposit of our one thousand blood sample from the umbilical cord to the bank, and we assume that there is over, 000 a year. 
The beginning of the next year, we would begin to offer is transplant into, ``specifies Dr. Décaryová which program of blood from pupečníkové cord describes as a very popular. 
``some of my mother are frustrated that do not have access to it,`` because Héma - Quebec does not have sufficient resources to this complex and dear program to offer all hospitals in Quebec.

``this is the traditional position, which again all previous governments. 
There is one border line, which already long Convention does not exist, and if there is good opportunity, in the name of the government of this position to take, ``suggested. 
Otherwise ``is in connection with the climate change also need to think our vision of the North,`` he said, as he spoke of the north - west, who, as a result of the melting glaciers opens throughout the year. 
In this new geopolitical context, Prime Minister considers that take territory shall become obligations. 
And what the people of the territory, the original nations and cold? 
Prime Minister said that the Quebec government to them will be very thoughtful, and that the project will be good for you, especially the young. 
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former pequistický Rep. from Ungavy), already began negotiating with about thirty communities. 
Activity began meziministerský Committee, which shall be chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which has an important position Julie Boulet (right and natural resources). 
Prime Minister shall not preclude the large meetings, ``not necessarily the summit``, but the moment ``will draw a common vision``. 
The development of the North, after all, should be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. 
The plan north will be ``together proposed, structured and environmentally sound and,`` he said. 
Jean Charest described the ``vision of`` as fluent downstream to the vision of a liberal Prime Minister, who prevent him. 
``as well as liberals who prevent us, we had changed his mind, to challenge turned into a new opportunities for growth and development.`` 
Such was, indeed, one of the still přetřásaných topics the weekend, who was in Friday made to the great cocktails vyzdvihujícím 50 th anniversary of the advent of Jean Lesage at the head of the Parties. 
One of the adopted resolutions of the proposed when Beauharnoisovu Adélard - Godboutovu based on the dam. 
``from Godbouta, who founded the Hydro - Quebec, through Lesage which carried out the placid revolution and nationalization of water of electricity, after Bourassu that created Jamesovu bay, managed to our party shape the future,`` he said Jean Charest. 
At a news conference shall be removed at the next authority, this time the conservative, and not to the program ``roads to the north`` John Diefenbakera, Prime Minister in 1957 to 1963. 
When he came to the gate hydroelectric station Eastmain1a - Ruper Charest, stressed that her run it is planned to the year 2012. 
``I say it only between us, but I have in the plan be there,`` he said to his membership, thereby called a great applause. 
The same Prime Minister, who in April said that, in the year 2008 the election will not be, and certainly not in 2009, the exclude the possibility of cause elections in the fall of this year, which allows for a law. 
However, stressed that the program is busy, in particular the mission of the Federal Council in China and the summit Quebec - New York. 
Weekend provided by Congress ’ s liberals platform for some of the nationalist resolutions, in particular a certain ``efforts to amend the constitution``, which have undergone a very smoothly: PLQ (liberal party Quebec) requires particularly the recognition of the specificity of the Quebec ``in the Constitution. 
They also wishes to Quebec named the part of members of the Canadian Council on radio and television broadcasting, who would have veto rights in the event of a decision taken in Quebec. 
From the opposition was a plan to north in its main features accepted with skepticism. 
Secretary of PQ (), parti Québecois Pauline Maroisová again she pulled the politics of the development of north of Quebec, which Landry government started in 2001. 
According to her, when the government liberals got in 2003 to power, abandoned to the functioning of this policy. 
If she held, ``they were now on,`` she said Maroisová alongside its candidate in Jean - Talon (where elections are today) Françoise Mercureové. 
ADQ said it will support the adoption of the plan north in the government. 
``I shall, however, that it was not a mere theater,`` he explained Sébastien Proulx, leader representing Maria Dumonta, now returns vacation picture. 
Letters - zneuctěná country 
It was a Vic Toews, exministr ``justice`` (oo irony) in a cabinet, who in the summer of last year to say about Louise Arbourové that represents for Canada ``disgrace.`` 
As follows potupit woman, which led the constant struggle for justice and who deserve all our admiration, that tell us much about the first surroundings and the Stephen Harperovi itself. 
We have a government that as the only from all participating Western countries moved back to his country ’ s national of a closed in a concentration camp Guantanamo bay. 
The government, which never taken into account that at the time when the should play actions which are late, was Omar Khadr young adolescents. 
The only the government, which still that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies their word and leaves rotted in human terms and conditions of the child soldier. 
One that relies on the parody of justice, in order to assess the defendant's to blame. 
Consider that, UNICEF, Amnesty international, and in particular the Association of Canadian advocate of lawyers repatriation Khadra Omar to in Canada could get a fair process. 
The same government closing its eyes to the torture: few her commitment to that this young man is henceforth psychologically damaged, and it will permanently, after many years of abuse. 
Realize it, but we just creeping witnessing the erosion of our rights, our freedom and our ``democracy``, words which Harper so much waving from his mouth and which is so vacantly. 
Came the time when already there is no morale: it is possible to the citizen torture of Canada, ill with him, it will be imprisoned by the head of the yet minority government (as it will be after 14 October...). 
Many voters believe that they save in hand, which proclaims the virtue, law and order: see that this government abandoned what was formely reputation and seriousness of our country. 
Shame is, sir Toewsi, in this waiving of, and not elsewhere. 
Views - Orwellian discourse of Barrick gold 
In the issue of 17 September published a le Devoir letter Patrick J. Garvera, executive vice president of Canadian mining companies Barrick gold. 
With Orwellian logic confirms that the largest producer of gold in the world began prosecution of three of authors and chudičkého little PublisherName for libel in order to invoke ``transparent public debate`` and requires them six million. 
- if it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, thought the truth of, in particular in the case of proceedings for libel, but the law. 
It is no surprise that Garver this vital resolution passes completely. 
Or is there for Barrick gold the best way to lead the public debate, to bankrupt anyone who dared to defend opposite position? 
Whatever the outcome however, authors and publisher of the books Noir Canada (black Canada) will be forced to spend worthy of the sum to be prepared to defend and fight in a very balanced fight with the military lawyers almost supported by deep pockets of mining companies. 
Tactics in those outstanding fighting, indeed, often consists in zruinování defendants in order to promote the conciliation proceedings which zacpe mouth the counterparty and, in addition, the upset anyone who dared to this matter to pay. 
If the company Barrick gold really wanted to public debate, had his view of the whole thing imagine a public opinion. 
Contrary to what is happening in several countries, where he is Barrick gold, in Canada is debate under normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas, and not the stick in his wounds. 
The coal company therefore did not than open his books, its documentation and to establish a genuine debate over the papers, media, publications and financing of independent scientific teams which could to help bring the light of the matter. 
Barrick gold, however, it seems, does not have confidence in public opinion and generally refuses to the petition and letters in support of the authors of the books Noir Canada. 
It may be Garver could explain how may require ``public debate``, and at the same time the views of the same despise the public? 
It seems that this word in viceprezidentově world indicates the only in bold paid by lawyers, and not all of the Canadians; this is fairly condensed treatment of this concept. 
In a democracy shall have the right to speak and nactiutrhači. 
Barrick gold or not - to recognize - that the public that supports authors and the publisher of Noir Canada, so it is mainly because he refuses to brutal ways of mining companies. 
The public is ready to listen, and Barrick matter to assess, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in the framework of what many see as the prosecution, in which they are to be the respondent stop his mouth (in the framework of its prosecution ``public debate`` company Barrick, by the way, just handed the official challenge to the authors of the Noir Canada to officially announced that they are to stop using this term...). 
Leaving aside surreálný Garverův speech, prosecution initiated Barrick gold is direct attack on the university freedom of research and search for truth, which are vital for each democratic society. 
Overall, denies the right to quote trusted sources and to the debate on the facts and interpretation, which represent alone basis intellectual activities. 
If in a country like Canada, impossible to study and discuss topics that I don 't like the rich firms of this world, without being issued repeated prosecution, who else it will be able to do? 
If the company Barrick gold really wanted to public and transparent debate, can be, if guided by scientific standards which used the authors Noir Canada. 
Has the right to answer. 
University environment to which belong, can have long been the control the debate and the differences and resolve conflicts. 
Excessive action of Barrick gold clearly shows that, despite what he says, does not have the slightest taste of lead transparent debate. 
For university world is a loss, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments introduce measures to such type of irregular prosecution of disruption. 
The operation to the rescue of Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans will mean 
The Bush administration and the leaders of the Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, yesterday came at last to the Agreement on the largest failsafe economic plan of the Great Depression of the 1930 s. 
The new version of the plan, as with 700 billion hindered the financial crisis, which already months shivering Wall Street must still be approved both houses of Congress. 
In particular it: better control of elected representatives of the above its application, the new arrangements to ensure repayment of the stored public money, new measures for collecting the quantity of home seizures of repayment rates, and also because of the right to monitor the earnings paid by the managers zachraňovaných firms. 
US Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosiová GOP leader, and at the negotiating table, Sen. Judd, Gregg said yesterday, the good news for a few minutes after midnight, two days after the end of the negotiating marathon. 
``we made much progress and have to the Agreement, which will be effective in the markets,`` said the Bush administration ’ s leader, Henry Paulson. 
``All were done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans were safe before the crisis that is in progress on Wall Street,`` said D. 
``This is a fundamental point: if you do, trauma, chaos and disturbance of the daily life of Americans will be huge,`` he said R. Judd, Gregg. 
During the last hours is negotiating ran up to a maximum of fear of the effect on, what should further failed on a state of investors. 
The specified time limit the opening - up of markets this morning. 
Both candidates for the U. s. President were invited to negotiations later and they express more for the Agreement, without, however, to express his dissatisfaction with it, that it was necessary to resort to so the solution. 
Democratic Sen. Barack Obama attributed the supplement to the Agreement concerning certain measures, in particular, to allow the owners of the conservation of residence, and measures on the basis of working State the rescue companies. 
``When, asking for taxpayers to take specific measures because of the responsibility of some of the people, not to what congratulating itself. 
These measures are, however, the necessary, ``he explained at the television. 
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was queried another station that will vote for the proposed plan, he said: ``I should like to see the details, but I hope so.`` 
``rough features, which I read, (show), that that was something that will all have to spend and what will be using to go any farther. 
Choose inaction are in short unacceptable, ``he said. 
The aim of 700miliardového plan is to buy the taxpayer money for bad debt, and the risk and marketable assets of US financial institutions. 
The plan comes after 14 months crisis triggered by the market bubble burst of real estate, which must first led to the collapse of the risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then the stepping on the other, widespread forms of credit (pcaa) and resulted in the freezing of cash and degradation of the banks and financial institutions. 
The decline in the first draft of the Agreement of the last week are implicated in Republican members of parliament. 
From the moment when the Democrats, agreed to that, for some% quot% toxic% quot% assets companies with the problem will be killed, but the government only buy is, it is believed that the deadlock is eliminated. 
In an effort to approximate the contradictory views in Congress has been affixed measures stipulating that the government will be able to introduce new fees, which he helped to get their contributions back if, in consequence of the program will have to take the losses for a period of five years. 
New schedule calculated with the contribution of the first of the amount of 250 billion to which will be able to add additional 100 billion, if the President be considered necessary. 
Deposit of other 350 billion should approve Congress in new voting. 
In exchange for his help Washington gets the shares in the survivors firms, which, in the case of profit will pay dividends and which will be able to sell again when it is all over. 
The federal government will have the option to delay the procedures seizure of real estate related to loans, which the plan applies, as well as to lay down limits for the amount of the evaluations and damages paid by the managers of affected by firms. 
Architect of the plan would you like to have undergone a vote in the House of Representatives and Senate is now in the centre. 
Despite all the effort it is still uncertain whether their plan will have a green. 
Yesterday, against the project to continue their voices in both the Republican, so in a democratic camp. 
``It is very clear that you hear the Washington,`` he said to the address of the voters R. Scott Garrett, a member of the financial the Commission of the House. 
``Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, there are solution. 
Make a taxpayers, however, the solution is not. `` 
The democratic U. s. representative Brad Sherman, the groups of members of Congress dubbed ``the Committee skeptics``, the whole thing, but otherwise is presented to the same conclusion. 
``four hundred weighted professor of economics, between them three Nobel prices, wrote a letter asking us: Congress to hurry, too, carefully examined the which way to issue,`` he said yesterday. 
In the same period, in Europe again confirmed that this crisis is a crisis of the world. 
After the end of the emergency meetings of the three countries have notified the Benelux banking group partial nationalization Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16, 3 billion). 
Government intervention of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that withdraws from the purchase of their konkurentky, which is on the verge of collapse since lost 2 billion euros (2, 9 billion) as a result of a crisis - risk credit for the purchase of real estate in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85.000 people, are among the twenty the greatest European banks and between ten largest insurers. 
``We 're not going to walk about the money,`` he said yesterday Dutch finance minister Wouter barefoot. 
``get ’ s vote in the bank and influence. 
And that is just the savers and household in today's uncertain time can appreciate. `` 
On the other side of the channel la Manche so far, it seems, has initiated the British government nationalization of another bank of the affected the financial crisis. 
According to print of England, the government to take over all the existing loans banks Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (75, 5 billion) shall constitute the credit for the purchase of real estate. 
In his previous notification may buy branches and bank accounts of clients British bank Spanish bank santander. 
Bradford and Bringley will be the second Bank following Northern Rock, that the British government must from the beginning of the financial crisis nationalize. 
Paul Newman (1925 - 2008) - the death of socially engaged icons 
Its beauty with cyan eyes long represented his trump card, by other weakness. 
Emerged, this American actor with begin a smile of narcissism? 
Yes and no. 
Stydlivost, sensitivity and continuing talent, custom, it also apart from the force of category, which produces a real stars. 
But what it was sprinter on a long line! 
Paul Newman died in Friday in 83 years to his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last of the icons fat years American cinema. 
Less of a magnificent than Brando, which was a similar and long was a kind of his rival on the screen, Newman was careful, the actor, certainly, but also the Apostle Paul of freedom, and the collapse of the dramatic Conventions. 
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children. 
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jews and his mother Maďarka origin. 
Of those of the European roots arose one of the famous face of the American dream. 
Without undue ego, which is the latest sign of quality. 
Because in to see him all this land in love to self made mana, warrior in the war in the Pacific, a wounded in the battle that early 50 s, he studied acting at Yale, then attended the New York actor 's studio and achieved triumph in the theatre, on television and soon in the movie. 
The same man, who fought for civil rights, was also auto racing driver, who shall be placed as a second to 24 - hour establishment in le Mans in 1979, and at the same time sex symbol of, and that despite from 1958 model was a few with actress Joanne Woodward. 
Also they go with him shady of the place of this hidden, discrete, socially engaged the stars, allergic to the clamour of custom show - business which remain for ever to a certain extent the mysterious. 
Decent man, in the sense of the word. 
Time out Paul Newman this weekend caused the dizzy lover film, while his large compete role on the black canvas memories. 
After more than a half - century defiluje ever - changing of the U. S. seventh - art. 
In memory was re - emerging šarmantní Cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid (1969), the young man, who refuses to his wife (sensuous Elizabeth Taylor) in the cat on hot roof, adaptation Tennesseeho Williams of 1958. 
From less ancient past (1990) the recall of its sensitive of Mr. Bridge, his in old age marriage, which all the expected. 
So many other Paul Newman came into history. 
Boxer Rocky Graziano, beaten, a violent, from unforgettable offender Somebody up there Likes me (in token of hate) Robert wise, roles for James Dean, taken after his death, which in 1956 Newman said in a true acquaintance. 
An affable gangster in a very great the Sting (Stinker), Oscar for best film in 1973. 
Once and vengeful billiard Player in amazing the Hustler Robert Rossena (1961), the same figure ztvární in the color of money Scorseseho Martin, which will bring in 1987, a single Oscar of seven nominations. 
This face coasting ages, it was he. 
And again he. 
In his professional career various epoch compete. 
The young it to know, in particular, thanks to the cult slap shot George Roy. Hill's (1977) of the role of Reggieho Dunlop, traditional - coach. 
Fans with him met again in 1994 in the Hudsucker proxy Coenových brothers. 
His career then closed the godfather Mafia ’ s role in the road that Perdition alone Mendes in 2003. 
Unlike a few cinematographic legend relatively soon had left craft, he remained Newman industry long, though condemned Hollywood with its veneer, style, and the concessions. 
The French filmmakers Bertrand Tavernier it, not without humor, ``for a living challenge underplayingu``, judging that in their performance too pressed in the mill. 
For the beautiful Paul Newman to which the role came as a tray of the profession, was not always so gentle. 
The first lovers, however, he played less often than outsiders: neurotiky, alcoholics rascals and desperate, whose upadání and rebellion it reflected in its with perfect features. 
As a director Newman revealed a little - known the pages of his shy sensitivity. 
His film Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (according to the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurenceové) in which the main role played his wife Woodward Joanne, shall make sensitive female portrait of full melancholy. 
His son Scott, which lost due to a overdoses, he spent in 1984 film Harry and son, work is filled with shame and sadness. 
In a gush of distinctions, which have received, yesterday Newman's great friend and former associates Robert Redford (played together in the Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid) she sat in sorrow he said: ``its presence was my life, and this country better.`` 
Velkodušnost, love to life, such are the main characteristics of the dead actor. 
Leaving aside his legendary career, is also a large warrior for civil rights, ecology, an independent film, opponents of the decline of Hollywood. 
A portrait of his we were used to seeing on a bottle of wine vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foodstuffs, which we would come taste enough, though initially were the gag. 
However, sales profits went on account of his of the Foundation for heavy childhood. 
Newman was so, rather than would let the glory of rock, until the last moment engaged in society. 
He had left her five daughters the letter containing such phrases: ``always and up to the end of it was your father grateful to their happy planet. 
I honour, that I could be here. `` 
And for us to monitor the honour allowed the way so seer and magnanimous American artist. 
And in addition, after all, model citizen. 
As the factory, on the invoice Zuschlag &amp; Co.? 
Before long, 8 October, begins to describe in criminal proceedings against Jánosi Zuschlagovi and his companions. 
Policies and his companions are in addition to the other criminal offences, including the counterfeiting of instruments, accused of fraud committed the long - term and systematically criminal organizations, as a result of which have been caused by an extremely significant damage. 
According to take advantage of the Prosecutor money in tenders for its own purposes and the performance of the tasks shows often notional invoices. 
Money from the State and local government - in total approximately 65 million forint - had moved in part to the funds organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly to his pockets of individuals. 
The way of which also informed the investigating the Office, was that the money obtained in the tenders have been selected on the basis of invoices, for which the real value, and adopted obligations associations fail to live up to never. 
According to the indictment, much of the invoices false. 
The forms of these invoices józsefvárosského came from the market, rounded stamp was produced in Kiskunhalasi. 
About to the names of which firms has the manufacture of invoices be decided, inter alia, to the orbital path after the north bank Balatonu, on which he sent Istvána Ladose János Zuschlag. 
According to his story he had first appointed by peep out guest houses and restaurants. 
In them asked accounts for their consumption, in accordance with the model of which were then produced invoices submitted in the framework of the tenders vypisovaných inter alia the Ministry of youth and sport, the Ministry of work and social affairs, respectively Authority of the capital. 
The invoice has exhibited majority István Lados with its member Andrásem Őrim, which according to our information most often wrote reports required to obtain the subsidy. 
In its ``Study path`` he Lados looked out one beer hall. 
By two invoices issued by Zuschlagem and his companions in 2003, ensure this device restaurant meals for devadesátičlennou group from the Alliance Biztos Pont. 
So many people should not, according to the claims of the lead firms to this device suddenly entered. 
Similarly, with the formal and the invoice issued by the errors in the summer of 2002 the Foundation named Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért. 
Pension in Badacsonytomaji had indeed, only three of the room, more than ten people in him one evening it, yet it was night on the invoice one hundred and thirty guests. 
Vyplňovatelé forms with rich fantasy but this swooped even when he said to the documents of the company also devoted to the hospitality - Pigal p. R. o., in which the accounts in accordance with information provided by the public prosecutors' offices of the documents in the name Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá or,.... 
The lead firms Győző Farkas for hvg. hu said that when he was invited to the Prosecutor and showed him the invoice, he knew at once that it is a false documents. 
``name of our business, and our tax number were thereon in the wrong place.`` 
As he added, in addition to the formalities agree nor that by invoice install 100 people, have indeed, only eleven rooms, which have less capacity. 
Moreover, it was on the invoice also restaurant meals, with their long period of work. 
Zealous producers invoices that, or that the Budapest vyhlédnutá organized by the travel agent only foreign trip, and on the invoice with payment in cash, which is also match with the bill to practice, said the company's foolishly as the mediation paths after Hungary. 
In addition, it appeared in the course of the investigation, said in a document also VAT, though organizing paths to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT. 
In the four documents issued by the Foundation Jobb Jövőért companies hotel Révfülöp p. R. o. resented outside the other or the amount of the tax. the firm has not apply provided 25procentní, but a 15% VAT, besides the exposed workers only printed invoices, produced invoice, however, was written hands. 
Out of it to ``publishers`` invoice to be by one company said, as it turned out the investigation of state agencies, as the carried out by the activities of the carriage of goods by road, which the company establishing originally on the investment advice exercise. 
That are invoices issued by the Foundation Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and the charities XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont false, he fingered besides, also due to formal the tolerances - corresponding invoice format and right stamp. 
As well as in the case of Ravenna to a. s. or sporting camp in Kunfehértó, whose leaders have denied that the invoice is posted. 
Forger, for example, notice or that the company HIB p. R. o. of Nyíregyházy was in the time (2001), when the group Fiatal Városért wearied of the Society, in the disposal of, precisely because according to our information winding - up the detective firms also denied that the paper issued on. 
Exposed knowingly invoice 
The second group of invoicing are those who knew that have post dummy invoice. 
The Foundation Esély Budapestért issued a accounts for roughly four million forint for the Foundation Harmadik Évezredért at the request of the organization of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták. 
Head of Collab p. R. o. caused by charges for the issue of the nominal account of one of the defendants Ludovic Györfi. 
The Zuschlagem and his companions worked also company Biogate p. R. o, currently being wound up, which in 2003, supplying the Foundation Jobb Jövőért and associations Atlasz and Vörösfenyő invoices in the value of the roughly five million forint, for which the real economic activity. 
Neither the movement of money, created invoice because they were later reversed, which, however, the organization of forgotten include in their documents. 
To other groups invoicing firms are those which have the links to the defendants. 
So it was, for example, Iván Kubatov authorized representative of the agent of the Ukrainian delta Trió p. R. o., dealing with the fuel and trade in the motor vehicles, based in Budapest, however, to which the company is not found. 
The company issued a in October, November and December 2005 now several invoices for the sales of the resources of the data - processing technique of about $18 million forint. 
According to the data of the investigations bought these invoices kiskunhalasská company Cash Investment p. R. o., which was from 14 September 2005 in disposal. 
The firm's secretary was the man from Romania, who was in the years 2002 - 2005 to forward the instruments concerning companies also Iván Kubatov. 
As we know, Kubatov during the investigation admitted that the company has issued the charities invoice Atlasz, Hoppá and the Foundation Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, and he took their value. 
Exactly at the request of the Ivána Kubatova were the Romanian mason based society fa - bani Jose Faipari p. R. o. and Jose - investment to a. s. 
In fact, however, or one of the companies was dead, according to the defendant because it would work. 
Still, he undertakings have been to the benefit, for, at the request of the lawyer spoluobviněného Zsolta Szenteho, who also prepare their spawning instrument, issued on behalf of the companies of the invoice the charities Atlasz and Y - Generáció linked to the Zuschlaga. 
On behalf of the firms Investment, delta Trió, fa - bani Jose, Jose investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov gave the total 15 invoices in the value of the 14.2 million forint. 
National agencies have decided that the Kubatov came to 10 percent of the amounts referred to in invoices and sales tax. 
Bank to the issue of invoices, this time to the selection procedure for the association Biztos Pont, used the man also firm Szi - Beri to. t. 
The y - Generáció and Szövetség and modern Magyarországért have made in January 2006 proposals to public competition of the Foundation Mihálye Táncsicse (dark), (public utility of the Socialist Party. 
Received after 500.000 forint, however, the amounts made to the objectives referred to in the applications. 
In order to ensure that it is clear, have submitted a dark five fictitious invoices from company works Team p. R. o. 
These invoices were, indeed, not found in the street inspection in the office Árpáda Kemecseiho to the Department of education. 
During the description of the part of the defendants may describe the progress made by the production of invoices, as already on the Prosecutor. 
Interesting may be more it if it decides to all reveal himself of the defendant János Zuschlag. 
His past the cancellation is not too detailed, and although several times already promised to all set out the great length, has not done so. 
The question is whether it is in the interest of - in return for payment of much of the damage, 50 million forint, perhaps Socialists have concluded an Agreement and Zusi it takes to himself. 
It is, indeed, while he could go and, for his application for the improvement of the conditions of its containment, namely on the location to domestic prison, remained, has so far. 
While the perpetrators of criminal offences, who have done much larger damage which have not yet paid is free to browse or at least expect to the end of the proceedings instituted against them in their homes, this option has no. 
Psychology trumfování: why spending more money? 
The auction customers are willing to spend more money revalue the goods. 
Neurological and economic foundations of this known - and seemingly irrational - behavior managed to reveal investigators from the neurology and economics New York University. 
According to their study, published in the science, unwilling to people in competition of type auction falls short of eBay, so that I would rather will pay and too high a price. 
Research using experimental auction scheme tried to cover this ``games`` in the nervous system. 
One group of volunteers betting, the second group in played auctions, using the method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studied the active brain areas of experimental persons. 
In both games to participants to win the money, but at a game of the auction, whose an important element is přetrumfnout the other side, he began in prohrávání intensively work a whole situated below a bark, called striatum. 
This area of the brain plays in addition to the many other functions role in ``sebeodměňovacím`` mechanism of the nervous system. 
Vyšroubování prices is therefore according to researchers possible to explain the effort to avoid violent reaction striata. 
To support his theory made a research team members from among economists financial cross - cutting of the investigation. 
By him under different conditions licitovaly against one partner three groups. 
The control group was simply told, what is the real value of the product concerned, and they take the stakes. 
The members of other groups was promised, moreover, that if they get from the game in triumph, would receive for remuneration even $15. 
The third group got $15, on the contrary, before auction, but in the case of losses they came its members and of this money. 
The difference between the two groups, was all told, that one highlight won and second lost. 
The members of the group of playing ``against the defeat of the``, however, were willing to go higher than it was in control and ``winning`` group, which confirms the hypothesis neurologist. 
``These results can not be deduced from any pre - existing economic theory. 
These, and not yet explain phenomena observable in the auction the joy of victory and by avoiding the risk. 
To neurological display methods helped us to resolve the conflict between these two theories so that we now they came to the third explanation, ``said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics faculty at New York University. 
Hepatitis: ever find a doctor? 
About half a billion people throughout the world have chronic infection hepatitis B or C, in Hungary is then this chronic diseases of liver placed between the main causes of death. 
The number of domestic cases of infection hepatitis is estimated to 100.000, but only seven, 000 of them shall be treated. The cause of this is that the sick often don 't know that are infection. 
Name of hepatitis is a summary description of infectious deterioration of liver caused by the different viruses. 
In their symptoms are many affinities, characteristic is inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the agent of the disease and the disease is caused by the different from each other. 
Hepatitis viruses in relation to any of the disease spreading the two major ways: hepatitis and and e digestive tract with infected (for example, food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and more viruses blood and body fluids (semen, poševní matter, watered). 
The travellers, in any event should protect the vaccination against the virus of the A and B, against the virus of the type of vaccine (C) does not exist. 
Symptoms of hepatitis and appears two to three weeks after ingestion of the infected meals, usually are accompanied by a sick, weakness, abdominal condition, the urge to vomiting. 
Then in the skin and the white creates a jaundice, becomes less intense faeces and darken urine. treatment may take two to three weeks. 
Die each year, the world over a million people in the serious nature of this condition, to the liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B. 
The main reason is that it is only the estimates of every ten infected medikamentózně treated with. 
Also hepatitis C may have a very serious consequences: if not treated, may lead to the liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. 
Most of the sick of his disease does not know, of the agent of the disease are destroying liver cells furtive, and so he took the first signs in many cases, after the 20 - 30 years. 
Therefore, it is very important early prevention, the regular screening. 
In three groups of this disease occurs more often than in diameter: between people who have had before 1991 blood transfusion between users drugs and between people with tatoos. 
Currently, the global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million. 
Because the disease can prove already routine laboratory examination, should the man in the event that the record any sign of unknown origin, turn to his of the medical practitioner. 
In the early detection is sick leave curable, virus can be of organisms delete, and prevent communicability and prevent the emergence of cancer. 
30 September is the world ’ s on the day of hepatitis, who was the organisations representing ill for the first time worldwide arranged in 2004. 
Its aim is to point to a chronic liver caused by inflammation of such viruses, to the causes of its establishment and of the importance of the early detection of the disease. 
Those who believe in God, that it so much hurt? 
According to the results of the recent research works belief in God as certain analgesic, which could facilitating the death of already Catholic martyrs. 
The Oxford University researchers have made an interesting experiment, studied how in humans affects the belief in God the perception of the pain, informed the British Journal Telegraph. 
In the framework of the rather a bizarre survey to 12 of Catholic believers and the same number of atheist electric shocks, while all the painting showing watched the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results were Catholic believers able to a large part of the pain exclude. 
Thanks to detail technology of the human brain has revealed that Catholics were able to activate the part of his brain, which is responsible for the control of the pain. 
Research is the first of a series of research, which, in addition to the academics participate in and scientists, philosophers and the theologians from different parts of the University. 
Test was quite so that, to his left hand the experimental body to sparkle tool that published the electric shocks. 
Researchers participants in trying to have asked she watched the two paintings: Sassoferratovu of the Virgin Mary originating in the 17 th century, and the lady with hranostajem Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15 th century. 
The authors of research, hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary for religious believers when a certain condition, while da Vinci painting selected so that from the first too differ, and the acts referred to in them reassuring. 
Experimental bodies were half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time they have received in the four consecutive parts of 20 elektrošoků, while separately followed image with religious or the general part. 
Catholics place that, in view of the Virgin Mary felt ``safe``, as if they were ``taken care of`` and ``relieved with, he filled is peace``. 
To monitor the picture with religious part felt in his expression of about 12 percent less pain, than when he had Leonard's work. 
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also attended the research, considers that a similar effect may be achieved by using any strongly impressive image for atheist, only should find the correct photo. 
``We would have to find image, which they see very positively, from the position of the mother or father,`` he said psychologist. 
The Bishop of the Wright greet the research results. 
``the practice of faith should change and in many cases also changes our personality,`` he added Wright. 
After so the excellent results of it is only a matter of what effect, on the regulation of the pain of believers should, if they have shown any madonu by Leonardo or the painter of similar caliber. 
Meant would look at the quality of the Virgin Mary achieve even better results? 
Are you what the share 
On its tenth birthday Google may declare that people can find him in his pocket at least as well as well as to the sky above his head; they know where they were on vacation, on what walks Support examination and what is concerned. 
By Eric Schmidt, one of the leaders of, but that there is not enough. 
However, as regards the skeptics, making parallels with Orwellian dark vision, it is not clear the very nature of Web 2. 0. 
Eric Schmidt recently expressed for journal Financial Times, whereas the main objective of Googlu is collect on users even more personal data, which is necessary to ensure that the founders Googlu could keep their original intention, who was: ``arrange all information in the world!`` 
By zpovídaného Representative Googlu stand firm even after ten years of světoborné work only at the beginning of that might not work with all the information. 
The question of what will it for five years, Schmidt replied that he would like to, if Google could reply to questions of type ``what am I to do to - morrow?`` or ``what would work for me, he threw?`` - to such seemingly simple questions, however, software will not be able to reply to up to that time, until the user not know enough information. 
Not all Internet users know that, during the search of the internet are accurately captured search words and that, of what the IP address of a search and on what pages to buyers after searching moved. 
Thanks to the Personalized search initiated by two years ago the users may, for example, keep a history of his surfing, they may be re - look at what they sought and on what click, making is then in the long term generating the findings adapted to a much more of them direct - to the same logic, shall be based, and the Recommendations, through which we system on the basis of the previously referred to and held preferences offer products and services. 
What if my information will be used against me, what if anyone peered, the, I explore? - they ask users who have the sight of a monopoly Googlu fear. 
In most cases are more of a range of potential power represented by the firm, backlash raise in Internet users sense of guilt, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or even revolt against the power. 
Of course, is confirmed by the fact that all the search expressions are not only collected, but in justified cases, they may also be issued by a third party, in such statutory cases moral rights Internet users did nothing. 
The best known example of the last time it was about a coordinated action against the Brazilian pedophiles during which provide Google Brazilian government information, which permit the identification of pedophiles of community - based pages Orkut, set up his through. 
Internet users who worried about moral rights, but he could not breathe, in May when the company hand in hand with the organisation for the protection of the electronic rights EFF successfully managed to his right in a dispute with the FBI: Google so must not be in the future of the Constitution to any Article to provide any information in secret FBI requested. 
(at the same time the federal government carve out successfully almost 50.000 Web addresses and thousands of search expression, which gained with reference to the strengthening of years before the law on the protection of children, yet, but she could not get the list of the items of individual users, or a complete list of Web pages and key words covering a period of two months.) 
The view to the Google is so conflicting enough: it is beat those who fear of their personal data, because they feel that their sex realm and private life by start to use the services of Googlu, displayed injury, and the campaign against him with the revolt, what it belongs to a transnational corporations with a conservative image. 
And while the American geek culture and its wild offshoot, group around enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, which appears in many countries, see a new generation of s big, ``corporation, what now buzzing around``, unlike his rival, due to Microsoft by Windows for Conquest of the world, however both are fighting for the same objective. 
This may be because the Google unlike Microsoft does not require a user from their identification code and won after them money for their application; open, free of charge and constantly fresh source of information and the package programmes shall act as a much more available, young, ``coolovější`` than the practice of the official software giant. 
However, this may be caused by also by geekové exactly understand very problematic relationship of the Internet and personality of rights, which brought just one of the key words declined form of recent years: Web 2. 0. 
Web 2. 0 is not on any other than for cooperation, to the effect that the deliberately kept feet and use channels of communication, which we have available, and though it is their range for each other, nature remains the same: shows. 
The average young man may lead the profile just on several of community pages from Facebooku after Xangu which may still link with other services, for example, with Twitterem or application last. fm, he listened music recording, all you can connect to the navigation systems, such as FriendFeed or Blip. fm, besides may write blog, which will automatically appear his latest fotogalerie, which imposes on the Flickr or Picase. 
Yet we can read about a lot of exemplárních cases, of which appears: friend morning at the sight of a photo of your buddy common slightly comes to that, having by its šálivý friend spent the evening, or the company can out of his worker only because it on his blog portrayed your honest opinion of chief leadership: one thing is certain, the concept of private life today is re - evaluated completely. 
The man who lives online life, consists of what the show, so we can define basic skrývající claim shall be for the behavior of today's youth. 
And who wants to conceal something or at least avoid googlovskému monopoly, has the option of (from the need to Scrooglem, which uses a search of Googlu, but deliberately leaves feet). 
Small number of people, for example, is it a - purpose registered on the community - based pages that could not be found. online application Googlu from a text editor after fotoeditor and reporting the portal is possible exchange for an alternate versions, which are not connected to the server parks and which of us form a that the best possible profile. 
Public opinion in secret not expected, when the Google shows teeth. 
The undertaking has its current value of $156 billion higher price than IBM (140 billion), intel (124 billion) or Coca Cola (110 billion), (ad linage AdWords / AdSense threaten the investment service advertising agencies and introduced by the ever - accelerating the pace of seriously znepříjemňují life not only Microsoft, but also many other software designer. 
Critical observers, however, are situated next to the counterpoint acting disturbing the impression: the top leadership, for example, has refused to protests employees after drove up to the twice the fee for business school, any frequent daily diet of workers in the management of too expensive, all of this, however, is losing its next to the fact that the Google still in 2006 bending to China ’ s government and within the meaning of their agreements filtered each award, which the like good taste, or interests of China ’ s regime. 
One of the internal rules of is that never forward advertise new services, only if it can be used, a certain, however, is that očekávatelné problems the following months and years may ache world on new places: while some believe that the project Googlu aimed at the scan and archiving books, magazines, shall take of a size such that the company will soon be have anything to do with the U. S. Supreme Court, others horrifies their health, it is we can build a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems. 
The fact that the Google prepares genetic database, then may serve as a good source material, and for the next generation of writers science fiction, famous it Coryho Doctorowa ``Scroogled`` describes the with Orwellian reminiscencemi future, in which can be to man odstrašivě well zoom in with only by using data from Googlu. 
The murderer - percent lower from Ózdu helped to delete feet two young persons 
Two young people listen to police in the case of a murder in Ózdu, by serious grounds for believing helped with deleting the feet of the offence on Tuesday, said a spokesman for the police headquarters župy Borsod.

Ludwik Sobolewski, the President of the stock exchange, said the offer, which has made Poland ’ s side, and yet that the Czechs Warsaw from the ring of possible new owners of the Prague stock market has previously excluded. 
The reason is the fact that the owner of the Warsaw exchange are State. 
99 percent of the shares shall be in the hands of the Polish State which wishes to 60 percent of the securities for several months to sell.

On the financial crisis in view of the European sheets 
In their Tuesday comments devoted to the growing international financial crisis has the front of the sheets of ``the other 11 September``. 
For global financial catastrophe can thank the American President, charges Roman la Repubblica. President even or rally was able to his own side to the aid of that hastily splácaného the bill, the aim of which is the axle of this desperate situation... 
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, which resembled a billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could speak more of the latter 11 September. 
Also, the part of the printing of Madrid sees the culprit in Washington, D. C. 
In accordance with the opinion of the journal El Mundo brought the world economy to the edge of the collapse of its out of political leadership. 
The collapse of America ’ s financial system is always growing, for which the payment at the end of the world. 
While Bush ’ s plan is perfect, after a vote in Congress, however, is in danger of Washington a political tool settlement of the crisis. 
The world economy hung in the air - just as being one of the biggest transition in the history of capitalism. 
The threat of may no longer be ignores, points Geneva Journal Tages - Anzeiger. 
Individual States not yet may throw vrávorajícím monetary institutions lifebuoy and taxpayers is could save before the crash. 
Collapse, however, if the as cubes domina yet another bank, then it will not be enough or the funds, or other jam. 
In the long term, it is necessary that the Member States of the European Union have transferred over its national egoism and unite control over fragmented financial markets. 
Only in Monday postonávající got the money of the Constitution of more than 100 billion euros, resembles the Vienna der standard, according to which are fears that like Americans will have in the interest of the settlement of the crisis dip deep into his pocket and European taxpayers, still real. 
The European Union, a crisis, which shall be as the tsunamis pouring the old continent, and not yet seriously in. 
``rescue workers`` may now waving hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good, if he firmly set, in which case it is reasonable to reach for tax money, in order to avoid even greater the damage. 
Smart auto mimics years bumble bees 
What do you think he was the best method of the development of techniques to prevent collision, if not imitation detector barriers to occurring in a world of nature? 
For example, in the case of bees. 
The default strategic the idea of the surprise of the project, president of the Japanese fair CEATEC, suggested engineers of firms Nissan bumble bees. went on how to build a new generation of systems to prevent collisions. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University built the Nissan biomimetický robotic the management system of the type of BR23C, robotic miniauto which is equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the ultimate aim of help to establish a system which can eliminate any reductions. 
``during the flight, each bee creates its own personal space oval shape, which, in fact, very like our safety protective packaging,`` he explained at the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, the director - general of the signs for the range of technological PR and the research and development. 
Play an important role compound eyes that allow you to see the bees in all directions in visual an angle of more than 300 degrees. 
To okopírování function composite eye reached engineers after the idea of the laser dálkoměru. 
That identifies the obstacles to the distance to 2 metres before BR23C in the field of vision 180 degrees, calculate their distance and sends a ship's signal microprocessor, which shall be immediately turns in the operation designed to prevent collision. 
Obstacle is caught in a split second, then begins robotic auto mimics the movements of the bees and turn of bicycles to the extent necessary to prevent collision immediately amended direction. 
Unlike any existing system výhybný manoeuvre is this completely instinctive manner. 
``if it was not, robotic car would it has failed to respond quickly enough in order to avoid obstacles,`` explains Tošijuki Andy, head of laboratories mobility and project robotic car. 
Must react instinctively and immediately, because the technology complies with the most vulnerable and internal security layer protective cover, within which it is withheld now regarded as inevitable. 
The entire process must reflect what he is doing a bee to avoid further bees. 
This process must not take longer than a wink eye. 
But unlike bees can not this movement of go up, down, or diagonally, can only be dvoudimenzionální and only in the direction of to rotate the wheels. 
Instead of infinite possibility that an offer of evasion of bees, so it was in the case of a motor vehicle only robotic applied to swing of movement, the acceleration and deceleration. 
BR23C uses lithium - polymerové accumulators which are lighter and have a greater energy density, which means that they have a longer life than lithium - ion variants. 
By Andoa is important instinctive, intelligent reaction, not the ability to processing, the less then the storage of data.... 
This mechanism must process and respond only on several of incoming signals a second. 
There is no need to keep and reacted with intuitive logic relying on data from previous maneuvers, therefore continually only used memory on the size of a few kilobytes. 
Need a memory of having giga - or megabajtovou capacity. 
This is the first step to exert technology used to immediate of evasion, which, according to the estimate of Nissan might get to the series - produced by the wagons in the ten years. 
Next the possibility of applying to represent the connection of the drive with the satellite - based Navigation GPS, who, after to avoid in the way he could motorists that lies obstacles to the specified to the final destination. 
My dear child painfully already has and name 
The law of the package to rescue the economy in the value of the 700 billion to be divided into several payments and the objective of which is to buy - out of junk credit banks, he has written form. 
In the first round of half the amount will be used. 
After other meetings, which ended up in Saturday after midnight the East of time, the leaders of the U. S. Congress to the Agreement in a few days prolonged debate on the package in the total value of $700 million, said the agency Reuters. 
``we have achieved a substantial progress,`` said Nancy Pelosiová, democratic the President the House of Representatives, according to which he had just left only the drafting of the Agreement. 
Compromise on the package also promote both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Finance Minister Henry Paulson of the result of a compromise said: ``program will not work and shall be effective, however, it is necessary to take the next steps.`` 
Written form of package has been published before opening the Asian markets in Sunday in 8 hours of the night of Washington's time (that is, on Monday at two o 'clock in the morning Central European time), but no particular the rise of the stock markets does not cause. 
On the application of the legal standards deaf to the name of the law on the emergency economic stabilization of the year 2008, which the program should establish, will vote on Monday first House of Representatives, then the sequence of the Senate. 
President George W. Bush was talking with Pelosiovou on Saturday night, then reports on the agreement also welcomed the White House. 
``with the progress achieved in the night, we are satisfied and very he appreciated the efforts of both parties to stabilize of our financial markets and the protection of our economy,`` said the White House spokesman Tony Fratto. 
A program is, indeed, differs from the original design of the Bush administration, in which should be that was to buy - back of quality mortgage - backed securities spent at once the whole sum of $700 million. 
It is now possible to spend in the first round a maximum of half the amount of the 700 billion, and so that the 250 billion will be applied immediately after on the matter by expectations in Monday decides to Congress, and the Ministry of Finance for them to buy securities backed by mortgages, which are evaluated as going bad, the fate of the remaining $100 billion then will depend on the decision of the President. 
The programme will be controlled by the special corps of which will be a member of the President of the federal reserve bank. 
Use of the second half of the 700 billion be depend on other decisions Congress. 
The Ministry of Finance may, within the meaning of the law apply combined tactics: may, at the same time redeem going bad loans, mortgages, and securities backed by mortgages, or other ``poisonous`` loans. 
- may take place in the framework of the auction and directly, inform the competent Ministry officials. 
Legal standard allows the firms to participate in its insurance program, in which the Treasury will provide a guarantee to the means representing the reason for concern, for which the companies will pay the price of the corresponding to the amount of the expected damage. 
As he said Henry Paulson, the law provides the necessary resources to it, in order to meet the urgent requirements to America ’ s financial system undertaken to $700 million, whether it be the large purchases of bad resources, their insurance or to prevent systemic risk associated with the breakdown of one of the great credit institutions,.... 
``will make the necessary steps to be ready for the law to establish as soon as it is signed,`` he added. 
Bosses banks, which ran into difficulties and waiting on the support of the State, on the contrary, provided that that the government will reduce severance grant - in overseas slang he says simply ``golden the parachute``. 
To reduce their disbursements will only in certain cases, in addition, this restriction depend on the type of assistance provided by the Ministry of. 
Restrictions in the nature of the means that will be the Ministry of buying in the framework of the auction, will be imposed on the golden parachutes tax margin, unless the directors banks sent right to a pension. 
In the case of direct buy - out of junk loans government aggressively take action in order to enable the money for the leadership were not exaggerated. 
To deliver that already existing contracts for the golden parachutes will change, restrictions shall relate only to contracts of new, which is to be the next an incentive to participate in the programme. 
``this is the first case in American history, when it will be in force the legal restrictions concerning remuneration Directors - General of the,`` commented the provisions of the President of the Committee for the financial services of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank. 
Besides passed on State in banks participating in the programme of the right to obtain, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as soon as the economy, and with it the woman bank back to his feet, may use this transaction and make. 
The plan of the draft contains that, in the following five years, the president of the Congress to submit a proposal providing for how to taxpayers up the expected losses on financial sector return. 
On both sides is, of course, there, and the voices of expressing in relation to the plan doubts. 
``on this US citizens requested us, that the tax dollars will not protect the taxpayer,`` he said Republican congressman from California Darrell Iss. 
Its democratic colleague from Ohio Kapturová Mary considered that, for the adoption of provisions of urging exactly those who are responsible for the collapse of the Wall Street.

Alternate between the period is the problem of the whole of the Christian democracy, and thus of Angela Merkel. 
Debacle was not for CSU quite startling, but in Saturday finished process that it was possible to assume almost exactly ten years: ended the offhand hegemony of one státostrany. 
Already ten years ago, in 1998, landed CSU to 47.7%, for the first time since 50. years under the 50procentní border. 
It was repeated three years ago in elections to the Bundestag in 2005, therefore, still in so often připomínaném Stoiberově period. 
This is the modernization, which CSU in this country has consistently carried out and who eats their parents. 
Sociologists to predict for 40 years, but in the pace of the very mistake. secularization, the results of the training, resettle Germans from the East and from the north in developing regions of Bavaria, however, yet could not be without consequences on the loyalty of voters CSU. 
Retrofit is associated with growth options, which also has its visible political consequences. 
Right - wing camp is intact, only the voters within it became more confident, critical restive. 
It is also clear that in recent weeks, CSU most moved away from the classic civil layers; people in a free of the profession, self - employed, individuals with high - school graduation, and with a university education. 
It shall support for CSU shrunken under 40 percent.

CSU: temporary mercy 
The fate of dosluhujícího duo Huber - Beckstein decides to the end of October 
Despite the shame of electoral debacle not yet fell head, the debate about personal problems was the Bavarian CSU while postponed. 
The President of the Parties Erwin Huber, and the Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in their places, the question is, dokdy this mercy persists. 
The fate of tandem, which suffered a devastating 17procentní loss of votes, shall decide the October last weekend extraordinary Congress Party. 
The members of the very criticized duo shall in any case pronounced that to their posts will not be sticking from all forces. 
Tried to calm him down so furious members of the fraction and bases, who due to the loss of an absolute majority of requested day after ``Bavarian tsunami`` drawing of personal effects. 
Five years ago - true, even under the Edmund Stoiber standing on top of the career - gained Christian - Social Union 60.7 percentage, now, year after the coup against Stoiber her strength, however, could only to 43.4%. 
CSU was in Bavaria producing 18 percent of the German GDP ``samovládcem`` throughout the whole of 46 years. 
Continue to have the conservatives in the south of the country of which the for Hungarian economy crucial importance, high position, however, in the future in any case, will be forced to to coalition. 
One of the first characters reorganization within the Party is the fact that a member of the team narrow intelligence, which begins sondovací negotiations on any coalition government Munich's FDP with liberal, respectively with the right wing pact free voters, and the vice - President and the federal Minister of agriculture Horst seehofer, who is considered the possible Huberova successor. 
Ironically, it to the list of free of voters to the Assembly got gabriele Pauliová, whose withdrawal against Stoiber used the duo Huber - Beckstein to perform the coup, but then with an ambitious municipal politician did ruthlessly short process. 
The leaders of CSU now focus all his energy on how Becksteina stabilize. 
For a transitional period of passed on active role Stoiber, who had spun the threads in the background, a former prime Minister of earth and a former chairman of the CSU called 28 September bitter on his political career. 
On Monday Huber said several vicious of the notes to the address of the CDU, it would have been from sister party deserve a much larger support. 
Other politicians CSU interpreted as a warning and defeat for the CDU and Angela Merkel. 
After the elections to the Bundestag attaching to the September 2009, Merkel will not be able to State Chancellor, if CSU, who played in the national success in 2005, an important role, together somehow make to his feet. 
According to Merkel, which due to failure difficult to hide his disappointment, will have a loss of positions CSU negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition. 
Which is, of course, the relative: nursed a wounded CSU will not be simpler and crisis of the social democrats insists on. 
The SPD reached in Bavaria with 18.6% of the weakest result from 1946. 
President Lukashenko: opposition - 110: 0 
Sunday elections to of Belarusian parliament he did not get one opposition member. 
Explain this can be according to Russian observers affluence, and stability of the prevailing in the country led by Aleksander Lukashenka, but by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) the legality encountered in addition votes. 
The OSCE that sent 450 observers of 43 countries admitted, elections. 
Although 110členný legislature 10milionové country lacks the opposition it well ten years, the opposition conjugated under the United democratic forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections earnestly hoped Lukashenko, which he kept on the basis of the constitutional changes in elections with debatable progress in 2006, and a fourth time restore his presidential mandate, this time ``to`` to in Parliament appeared several members of the opposition. 
So she dropped the ODS and from the previously considered boycott. 
In the background of the opposition expectations was that on Russia economically still more dependent Belarus - to alleviate the impact of the ever - zdražujícího import of Russia ’ s natural gas take credit and helped, and to ensure that the company Beltransgaz, owning gas pipelines passing through the countries, came to the Russian hands - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where the Belarusian political establishment of the anti - democratic as Lukashenka and other high - level politicians are not input authorization. 
To release the previously pointed out that the OSCE in the evaluation of the electoral campaign emphasis on the positive shifts, and not to the shortcomings - - for example, to the prohibition of applications for one - third of the opposition candidates. 
Monday's blitz message OSCE has, however, should the reservations and to the campaign, during which the opposition candidates practically may appear in the press, above all, then the opposition can not be present aggregation of the vote. 
At the same time with the opposition feel in the political system they improve: political prisoners were dismissed to freedom and Minsk is ready to begin the with Moscow and in smaller confrontations, if still refuses to recognize divorced from Georgia South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia with which are Belarus on paper federal State, it shall be considered this two territory had month for independent. 
``we two steps forward and one back, but the most important is that he began to dialogue between Belarus and the EU,`` said our sheet of Alexander Milinkevič. 
According to the opposition candidates from the presidential election in 2006, it is desirable that, so I remained, and yet that ``the power by drop to unimportant Parliament a single member of the opposition``. 
In view of the results of the opposition does not plan to protest, rather is trying to deliver voters his message to the need to economic reforms. 
``with the we, of course, many of the problems, the opposition sheets must print in Russia, the distribution of put obstacles to the local authorities, and so, however, I see that the change supports more and more people, and between the older,`` he said Milinkevič with by noting that Lukashenko regime, who for its biggest success considers the creation of social security, regarded as the correct or more officially supported layer of pensioners. 
``because of indebtedness of the country and the growth of the trade deficit is only a matter of time, when the social security 'navozující silence cemetery' collapse,`` says Milinkevič. 
Unlike the opposition's policy of Russian observers elections as a democratic. 
The head of mission of the Community of independent States Sergei Lebeděv Russian intelligence agency Rio novelty said that ``the people distrust of words, but action``, so that the absence of opposition, is nothing more than the evidence of maturity Belarussian voters.

Accidents at work, Napolitano: ``rezolutní prevention of`` 
On every day in Italy becomes 2. 500 accidents at work, die three persons and twenty - seven will remain permanently disability. 
Values Inail confirmed that, for the year 2007 we have roughly 1. 200 deaths as a result of accidents at work. 
These values attest to the seriousness of the scene, which remains one of the main reasons of death and zapříčiňuje almost twice the deaths in comparison with the murders. 
That was again awakened the attention of institutions, social, and information about this dramatic the problem today, Anmil celebrated in all of Italian regions 58. national day the victims of accidents at work laid down on the following Sunday in October. 
``disturbing data extended Anmilem and the same tragic messages of these days confirmed as important question of safety work``, confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in the message sent by the president of the National Association of Anmilu, for tortured and invalids due to work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of State expressed its alive admiration for a common effort to safety at the workplace, on the protection of the casualties of workers, to help families of victims and for the excess of public opinion. ``. 
``naturally was disturbed enough ',' a genuinely shared in the face of a tragedy that of their extent produce turmoil in the media and participation of public opinion, but a daily fact us again offers a dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamism``. 
Napolitano does not hide that ``here will no doubt exists, and the problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information. 
Special importance shall take numerous imposition initiative in the field of education, to young people, who are facing the world of work, obtain brighter of consciousness. 
It is necessary to refer to this effect, it shall give due to his disturbing social gravity, apply and improve the legislative standards. 
The President of the chamber gianfranco Fini from their parties stressed, ``as the phenomenon of death as a result of the accident creates absolutely critical social status, he was insulting conscience of each of us and make all institutions to convincing efforts to must end this state.% quot%. 
``What concerns of data accidents at work, it seems that show a positive turnover, however, this denying that the number of deaths as a result of pracovníh accident is so as so alarming,`` he said President Anmilu Pietro Mercandelli. 
``to just that this`` efforts to reduce ``led to less attention, because it was at the time when the attention of ceases, the tragedy. 
``we believe that it is generally did too little to stop the problem of accidents, and there are many activities which may have on this issue influence. 
It is necessary, in our opinion - stressed Mercandelli - increase the checks and inspections, but also more zásahnout in the area of training of personnel, and it now from the school age. `` 
``is still the need for further effort - he added, as regards communications and participation of public opinion. 
But it is mainly to be a greater sense of responsibility by employers to phenomenon, which represents the exceptional social phenomenon. ``. 
Mercandelli finally said that it is a progressive degeneration levels of the right to compensation envisaged for the victims and ``delaying the support care`` to which the system in recent years receive. ``.

MP3 Player accused of hearing, at risk 
Listen for a longer period of music and use portable musical instruments as MP3 Player may may have caused the permanent damage to the ear. 
By now a published the notification of the European Commission, which in one of the official report extended in Brussels cites opinion komitétu for science of health risks which, in the last time yet come and have been identified (Csrseri) Eu. 
``from this scientific opinion – read in notes – implies that 5 - 10% of those that for a period of at least five years, listening to the music with portable musical instruments, a week more than an hour a day and maintain the apparatus to the volume of high - risk permanent loss of hearing the ability to``. 
``I worry that such a large amount of young people who use often portable musical instruments and mobile phones to the high sound levels, may unwittingly harm his ear incorrigible way``, he admits Meglena Kuneva. 
``of scientific findings – continues leading – implies a clear risk and should respond quickly. 
The most important thing is that we must encourage consumers and publish such information. 
We must continue to re - examine the already existing control systems in the light of this scientific findings that have become fully effective and in order to keep up with a new technologies ``. 
Brussels has requested to the independent scientific komitétu that this problem be examined, given the high use portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin. 
``scientists – has closed the executive officer Eu - confirmed that it should be to worry, and now the European Commission shall verify, together with the other members and parties that the problem of have raised, which measures could be eventually load and thus better protect children and young people before issuing noise, author of which are portable musical instruments and similar establishments `. 
In the present already exists security European standard, which the noise level of the portable musical instruments to 100 dB, however, are rising fears about the damage to the ear, which may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise. 
It is possible to very to limit the damage that we find solutions as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure. 
In his conviction the scientific Committee Eu says, users of the portable musical instruments, if you use a music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, exceeds the currently valid limits corresponding to the maximum noise at work. 
Those who listening to the music in such conditions for a longer period of time, risk after five years of permanent loss of hearing. 
This issue should relate to 5 - 10% of the users of such devices and their quantity may be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in Eu. 
Rome, Alemanno allow free the progress of the Commission for the future of the capital city 
We begin to shut down now, in March, in June we have sums. 
Such is the calendar the Campidogliem workers% quot% the Commission for the future of the capital city of Rome ``, meeting today morning in its new headquarters for Caracallským bath. 
In the six měsích President Antonio Marzano and other 49 of the members of the Commission shall draw up a manual for Rome. 
To be in March closed the door, Giunta and the Council will assess the analysis and projects, so that in June they could imagine strategic plan for Rome with ``the official stamp`` Campidoglia and his radního Gianniho Alemanna. 
``the Commission is fully independent, and there are included all political, social and cultural ideas – wants to emphasize Alemanno – will need to ensure the proposals to the development of Rome, which eventually apply political arbitrators, which remain Giunta e of the Council. 
It was no exchange of functions, but only on the effort to have some place where the processing of the large project for Rome. 
In March will be completed work and then dissolved, because this institution shall have the exact time limit. 
In June - Mayor – to portray the strategic plan and take advantage of work, which the Commission has done for the future of the capital city of Rome ``. 
Those who accuse the Commission from inadequate whereas its opinion will not be binding, Alemanno replied: ``all depends on work, which the Commission will be able to do and to the quality of their proposals. 
If the quality, as the Commission proposals Attali, and I am sure I in Rome, its contribution will be decisive. 
Too often, policy and to the daily problems and to the urgency, which arise from time to time. 
We, on the contrary, we want to look more, and, in a deeper perspective, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future. 
In addition to the mayor of Rome stressed that ``this is unnecessary undertaking or the Commission or Lies: is completely free of charge, the Roman citizens State or the euro and serve to popřemýšlení and involvement of the best intelligence that capital has``. 
For Alemanna, in essence, ``you must have the strategic design as a starting point, or definitive or still to be able to afford to our city apocryphal rise to the level of which necessarily needs, and think unified spirit to its future.``. 
The future of which, specifies the mayor of Rome ``shall not be limited to the current municipal boundaries, but will be looking much further on`` not only in the future optics metropolitan town and its legal status of the capital, but ``also includes role Rome can and must carry out as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean region``. 
Obama? first anti - American president he knows why. 
One known President wrote that is important for him to remain independent: ``Barack Obama will be the second anti - American president.`` 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated his decisions, the US economy and kept the relations (as I now as private citizen) with the enemy of Islam ``. 
Attacks against Obamovi are increasing, just as close to the date of the election. 
One woman of Miami wrote to the Web site: ``this man is full of ambitions. 
Obama has but effrontery: they think that gets to the top of the post of a nation that all round, two guvernátory and five black senators! ``. 
In fact, these attacks don many ``; they are the attacks clearly racial origin and do not correspond to the question of voters: will be good president? and then we have I surveys; all say that wins Obama, with a large margin. 
In this case, there are those who act in his heart and not referred to in the brain. 
One newspaper of the Mississippi River, out of the middle of the south of the United States, written comments: at least once in the electoral kabince know very well, to have my voice American secret soldier. 
Comes to the povrh one page of the American mentality that remained skytá until the last moment. 
Call, what do you want to, in the end, they see themselves, who check whether Obamu or McCain ``. 
There are people who vow: if he had had to win Obama, had gone from America. 
They are the things that were not have never expression, it seems almost some success of black candidate. 
But, despite all these considerations for democrats is the main weapons George Bush. 
Asked to 1500 people error: What did Bush in the course of his mandate? eighty nine percent said: Iraq. 
America is amended. 
In Vietnam this people he lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent him home with a kick into a trance. 
In Iraq zratilo life 4500 soldiers and Americans were forced to the collapse. 
And yet he became Iraq for most of the Bush weakness. 
Those who enter the location Georgia w will have to do a task. 
The economic collapse of the US felt and journalists: in the newspapers is the investigation period and many accuse the Internet, ``killer`` of publications. 
PEW research center ask five hundred journalists on the status of their profession and provided as for the future. 
Now today are nearly all journalists pessimistic about his future. 
However, such openly said that they have less concern about the trust. 
Don 't feel to be isolated as once. 
The problem for American journalists are money, the money. 
For these journalists is a crisis of the year 2008 crises bad economic model. 
Out of the cuts made in newsroom, in rooms where work editor to raise the newspaper, the big problem. 
By ranked journalists, this is a problem that needs to be resolved, whether to traditional journalism as it understands the general public, fundamentally changed. 
American journalist pervades clear, but the complex pessimism. 
The six of the ten journalists of publications and executive seniors are convinced that the journalism in the national scale shall be issued by the wrong way. 
In the local area is executive group to 65%. 
Printed against the broadcasting. 
For journalists is difficult to see where is this Web site. 
The greater the publishing house he makes his way to the Internet, which many see as the ``killer`` of publications. 
``economic coercion`` on which journalists suggest, increased by up to 79%. 
Five hundred ranked journalists admitted that resort to technology in the hope that, for their journalism ``executes something good.`` 
The largest gap in the U. S. novinářství is between those who governed newsrooms – that is leading – and reporters who work for them. 
56% of leading to the national level, it is certain that their reporters shares their values, while at the local level value falls to 23%. 
This is for someone what to do with ``security work``. 
The managerial, who think that's the place during the three years, is at the national level 47%. 
As regards the journalists, running to 30%. 
As regards the ``some work`` relating to staff (our editors ndr) in America is still on the right. 
Only 13% journalists is working on the contract. 
In so great nation as Usa, three hundred million people and, 000 newspapers, magazines, rádiemi, TV, and the Internet employers often offer what they want to, and so is the question take or leave. 
Leading receive almost always huge salaries and editor can earn $10, 000 a month and non - payment of pensions and insurance. 
As concerns the permissible, then argument is more difficult: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to achieve 15 days after a certain number of years. 
However, the U. S. journalists, according to its own confession, develop often in the course of one year. 
It is the only question climate. 
Unipol: court in Rome, Danilo Coppola remains in GROTTAFERRATĚ 
The President of the other criminal Senate Roman court, Carmel Rinaudo, decided to reject the submission of entrepreneurs with reality Daniel Coppola, which has requested that he could move from his town, Grottaferraty, to the apartment in Rome. 
Coppola is examined for bankruptcy in connection with the bid against on sale unipol - BNL. 
During the process to custom cost won the last week of domestic release from prison, which was converted to the forced permanent residence in Grottaferratě. 
His lawyers, Michel Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked to businessman with reality could change the place of residence of the country - town into the town. 
But, according to the court of this move (against which the expressed pm) would not affect your company and get to the evidence accuse him. 
Elites in danger 
This phenomenon has already expressed a few days before, when representantů chamber voted against the plan to provide $700 million presented to the White House: much of Americans more interested in and interested in the punishment of Wall Street than on the rescue of economics. 
Confirmed even yesterday's New York Times, which shall inform us that the current crisis apart by Republican Party, ever more divided between their old soul East coast, milder, responsive to the federal institutions and to the business community, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, the conservative, hostile to the ``to those of the Washington » and towards the world of finance, strong, in particular, in the States in central part and in the south of..... 
The spirit that arrogant effect by taking a vote, of which I spoke to the beginning of the..... 
This is cited thing is, however, a example changes, the big changes to the current economic earthquakes already shows: not only in the United States, but at its west and perhaps not only here. 
In both the Usa, so in Europe, it seems that this crisis acts as an accelerator phenomena which have been in the incubation has long, which shall be in a new underlay climate, and at last come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is reaktualizace, emergency recovery of the market, double the categories of State - power in relation to an znovuznárodnění economics. 
Crisis is indeed crises bankovně financial institutions, which of course have strong ties abroad, but in which they are, in particular, included in the maximum rate of budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single State. 
At the same time as a political problem for you, what was the controls: that is, to respond to the problem and protests people and families, which are inter alia the voters. 
In short crisis appears economically the world, but politically almost exclusively national. 
Political mezinárodnost seems to be considerably outside the game or that does not have nothing much to deliver: visible proof to the European Union, which is broken down as always between the different interests and the various national strategy, and which can not decide for one common political line. 
And they all intervention for the government of each individual State, rescue plans, revival of the market, the new rules and, above all, the allocation of funds: when we get to the predicament, only States have economic resources, the amount of the financial resources to be able to try to give all right. 
And also the custom of the necessary means and permissions that is likely to use: two sources of immense value, in certain circumstances, which perhaps none market and no international organization will never be able to have in a similar way. 
This new emfáze crisis, which aims to státně - national element, is, after all, in their accordance with more EEA, who is trying to last economic progress attributable to one factor closely associated: territorial jurisdiction. 
Ironically, in fact, while we were convinced that we entered the Kingdom site, increasingly sophisticated technology, imateriální, while we were convinced that the global finance were already destined to rule of the world, all of a sudden, we realized that our future, will have on the contrary, still more wrestling with such few material things such as water, corn, NAFTA. 
All things, who it was said, may be moved from one place to land on the other, are, however, in any case the United, absolutely, to by area, territory. 
So who become their rulers, he must be much more cards in the hole than who he is, and who has the misfortune that lives in place without the corn, without diesel fuel, and without water. 
I get to the other, innovation, which, however, expect a breakthrough. 
Who talks about the Territory, State government, inevitably talk about politics, therefore, on the leadership. 
Having regard to the economic crisis, it seems, by building up two konvergentní phenomena. 
On one side of awareness that is objectively the need for authoritarian leadership, the request for someone who would be able to take hold of the situation. 
From the other side of the wave zdiskreditovanosti against an existing leadership of, in particular economic, which shall be shown as unsatisfactory and full of the dark places. 
And together something deeper and in a specific meaning of worrisome: zdiskreditovanost, impatient, a sense of the insolvency of and the absence of which is trying to dominate the whole of the ruling class in the still more Western countries. 
It seems that it is still more extends in broad masses of the population of the belief, than to their actions of the same as the thoughts still popular elites, as their method of feeling and of being, as their culture in the right - hand sense of the word that elite had already traversed their time and is indifferent to the views of the majority. 
The request to leadership in short vyživuje from underground one branch, but a strong movement for the removal of the ruling classes and traditional political order is shown in running into the ``resistance » or in unexpected change of collective sentiment in the last and the very last time, from the conservative the rise in Austria - Bavaria to the fall of Labour's in Great Britain, to the rebellion of U. S. members of Congress against Bush (and perhaps with this has to do, and the victory of the right in Italy). 
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremony, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone said their format, are still more problems understand, thus represent, which, not from today, is produced in the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis to strengthen, getting, potentially too much shaking. 
Before that would be exaggerated talk about the permanent ``mass rebellion.`` 
But I 'm sure we can say that it is to be properly open his eyes. 
Super glue to going over the walls 
Laws to overcome the gravity super glue and in the future to walk the walls like Spiderman. 
This is the object of the various American research center, and now the team four institutes very near to him. 
Scientists managed to keep stokilogramové body put up to the vertical wall with labels by only 2.5 centimeters square. 
The study of - American magazine Science published an discoveries of some researchers University in Dayton, in Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and research laboratories Air Force. 
Material, who invented the team of researchers, is the development of materials of already existing that use the special structure of carbon, which is carbon the tubes. 
« basis glues can be imagined as a series of pipes - lying as ordered a pile of spaghetti » explains Zhong LIN Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
Scientists inspired gekonu legs, with the microscopic hairs which allow the animal to ensure the perfect adherence. 
The tests carried out on the various materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper has shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the feet of these of reptiles and at the same time ``simply unsticky from the walls of the » explains Liming Dai, researchers civil engineering Dayton University School of Medicine. 
Go along the walls? - ``This material could be useful as a makeshift glue » deliver Liming Dai. 
Perhaps to going after walls as Spiderman? maybe so, but researchers thought about the far less fascinating use as the conjunction of electrical equipment, because the carbon tubes are conductor heat and power. 
Other application could relate to the air space engineering. 
So far no super heroes. 
Other research – also University in Berkley, in California, shall be given to the research into new glues. 
In one Article of American chemical society, California scientists said glue moulded from micro fibres as her hair, which are themselves to clean from dust movement after the desktop that still retaining perfect přiléhavost. 
Drugs: never having juices 
Attention to the grepový, orange and apple juice. 
Take if these beverages which are consumed, in particular, in the summer, because they are full strength and vitamins, together with some life - saving drugs, their stomach is amended amplification or the reduction in the efficiency with serious effects on health. 
In order to David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London stressed the risk of juice both finished, so fresh in combination with the stomach of certain drugs, on a current 263. national meetingu American chemical society in Philadelphia produces new alarm: just one - glass grepového, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some life - prolonging of drugs, to backing out their beneficial effects and health risk exposure of patients. 
Grepový juice has already been charged that is responsible for that increases to toxic the level of the effects of certain antiaritmických drugs, antibiotics, anxiolitik, antihistaminových and of neurological drugs. 
Drugs in the risk - announced it myself the Italian medical agency in a newsletter two years ago, and roused doctors and patients to underestimate the dangers arising from this mixes and to wary of what drink in the case of that take medicine, as for example diazepam or Metadon. 
Grapefruit – not only experts also orange and apple juice contain substances which drugs soothe. 
Long list of effects snubbed grapefruit and other juice. 
Then prompt Micheleho Carruby, director of the pharmacological department State University in Milan: ``such discoveries, the majority immediately notified to various international and national lékárnickým agencies, which eventuelně shall arrange for the exchange of information and instructions drugs. 
So the READ always illustrative tickets drugs that, and if something you clear, troubled with, but ask your doctor or your pharmacist for clarification of the stressed expert for the agency Ansa. 
Paul Krugman Nobel in economics 
The Nobel Prize has been allocated Americans Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities. 
Krugman is 55tiletý Novokeňan, who teaches at the University of Pricetonu and which is known editor of the new York times. 
Krugman is one of the most important critics as for foreign, economic and political steps of the Bush administration. 
Several months after the assassination in September 2001, in days, when going out of business Enron, Krugman predicted in one notes issued in the New York Times, whereas the other event, within the meaning of the consequences for the history of the United States, a much more important than the first. 
× forecast, which produced a few of controversy and for years for which he was, however, has proved to be an exact. 
``I was surprised and shocked, with what speed crashes like Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the interest of the public, he said Krugman at the end of the year 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Biniho Smaghi of the Executive Committee Central European bank is Krugman ``economist of the great importance », but also popularizátor to`` very aggressive style, in particular the critical against the Bush administration's excesses liberalistické ». 
Open office, there's the third issue of the package ``anti - Microsoft » 
The day of issue of the open Office. org 3. 0, package open source personal of production, which points to the penetration of the still more users, from households to the office of experts to the public administration, as free alternative unknown Microsoft Office. 
After about the annual work voluntary workers, the sun Microsystems, with new open Office shows the general public with different news: to the welcome screen and to the revised and enhanced opening the window add additional, far more important, as the compatibility of operational system for Apple Mac OS X and support for the new format ODF (open document format) 1. 2, the last the standard version of ISO. 
Emphasis shall be placed to cooperation with this package Office 2007, the open Office is unable to open the document with a new extension (. docx, Microsoft. xlsx,. pptx). 
Interesting are special features of some models as what allowed decrease the dimensions of the PowerPoint, useful for example for transport by electronic means, or transfer PDF folder to the model of the video implementation and keep the original page Setup.... 
From this point of view, still can create documents ``PDF hybrid``, like a typical graphic format of the Adobe and have the characteristics of the spreadsheet or text program. 
Cooperation is element, which won many improvements within the applications programs: in excellu it is possible to work together between the different users and avoid conflicts to the changes, in a text program each staff assigned one color to talk to clear identification of in the review phase. 
Some of the firms work also on the transmission of certain features of the open Office on the Web (on the cloud), and in the following weeks should přestavit definitive result. 
The Italian version is available to download from http: / / IT. openoffice. org / download / 3. 0. 0 / download300. HTML, has been added to the English version, which is on the mirror from Friday. 
In addition to the Windows and Mac OS, as usual package is also available for operational Linux. 
Setup cd may also be at the request of the sent home or to the workplace. 
And if the topic bezplatnosti may be tahákem to expand in the household, just to trade area open office package very betting, and can no longer count on different projects realized in the public administration and in schools. 
And there are also offer training, consultations and assistance ideal for small and medium - sized firms, which could open trade perspective. 
Open office shall consist of five main models: writer, for video typing replacement word; Calc is spreadsheet, which points to the refund Excel; Impress presentation for similar Powerpointu; Dbase, as in the case of the famous Access, is a program that allows access to the databases; Draw, finally, is a model. 
The aim of for the year 2008 is to achieve a 5 million download, and when they consider that the to - day we were almost to 3 million and 600.000, with a new version is possible that this the expected number may also be overcome. 
Also the results of the Kohl are positive, it is the fourth the drug's case 
New positive the case to the last the Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from team Gerolsteiner, the third classified and T - shirts winner best vrchaře. 
The report of the reported the journal pages L 'Equipe. 
26ti - year - old Kohl is the fourth skaters positive to the cer, Epo third - generation, after the Italians Riccardovi Riccò and Leonard Piepoli and the Germans Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner. 
The results of blood samples Kohl fall into those which have been carried out in recent weeks laboratories Losanna and Chatenay - Malabry. 
If the inspection of analysis confirm pozitivitu to cer, an Austrian's third place on the tour and will have to face laid down disqualification of two years. 
The report on the pozitivitě Kohl to Epo third - generation confirms the head of the French Anti - Doping Agency Pierre Bordry Associated Press, which announced that he had informed of the outcome of the Austrian government authorities. 
26ti - year - old an Austrian shall be placed at the stages of the winners for Spanish Carlos Sastrem and Americans Cadel Evans, he also specks best vrchaře T - shirt. 
Immigrants: New York Times asked, is Italia racist? 
Italy ``as a country of immigration is only in the last house turned to the prime objective of immigrants`` taken with disgust. 
It makes the beautiful country to the nation racists? so wonder in one long Article New York Times, which give this Article debate on the subject of racism in Italy, and began to take the case of a young Abdul - William Guibre originating in Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, because they had stolen a box of biscuits. 
This case exposed, what New York Times define ``the paradox of the north``: northern areas are at the same time those where the registers ``more integration, and more work``, but also ``strongest antipřistěhovalecké sentiment in the country and strong support for the Northern League``. 
To confirm the increasing tensions between Italy and immigrants, NYT citing cases of zero tolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna. 
Not only that. 
Also the new legislation the requested Legou, which seeks to impede immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is quoted as example changing climate in Italy. 
Weighted average tendencies as Pope, as President of the Republic: ``Giorgio Napolitano, then what met with benedetto XVI in Quirinale, requested that State, and the church together worked in the slaughter racism``. 
Students victims of precious rents - to 900 the euro for the room 
Market renting for university students can not recognize crisis. 
According to recent research Sunia, trade unions for the tenants, renting a jednolůžkový room may student of the State in Milan to 900 the euro, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600. 
``phenomenon has already reached its of a size such that all the layers of students have lost the right to the study of overall too high due to the prices which would their families had to endure - explains office manager for the study Sunia, Laura Marian – in this city of high demand from the students distorted market in such a way that led to the process of price increases, which shall rošířil to persons resident in the``. 
In most cases the rents contain several offenses: a of the Treaty the free manner, registered, without limited hiring out, the lodgings. 
For Sunji should exceptional action that could thanks to the revision of taxes regulate prices. 
If you look at the details of research, we shall see that, in Milan, in the field of Brianza, need to one bed about 450 euro, for jednolůžkový room shall be paid from the minimum prices 650 (zone band ner) through the middle of the 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to (maximum 900 (in zone Vitoria). 
In Florence is one berth in diameter of 350 / 400 euro, one room about 700. 
In Bologna, where the students is concentrated in zones near the universities, it is necessary to 250 / 280 euro to the berth in dvojlůžkovém room, from 370 to 500 in jednolůžkovém. 
In Rome in central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) to roughly 600 the euro for jednolůžkový room, 450 bed in dvojlůžkovém. 
Values are on a little lower (550 the euro for jednolůžkový) in zones near the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
Save only if the move to peripheral areas: 300 euro to the bed and 450 for jednolůžkový room Prenestina zones, Centocelle and the like. 
In Naples is behind the bed to 300 / 450 euro, for the room from 400 to 600 euro, with the highest prices in zones Policlinico, Vomero and colli Aminei. 
In Bari want for bed 250 / 350 euro, at least the 350 for jednolůžkový room. 
In smaller towns prices are certainly lower, but have a greater impact on the economy of citizens. 
In cities as Perugia, where is the most common phenomenon rent for students from countries outside the European Union, it is finally recorded one other anomalies: increase in roughly 25 - 30% of the charge, who want to after foreign students, compared with the Italian. 
Good - bye old Paradiso cinema, the town is historic theaters 
Cinematographic historical halls are closing in favour of sclerosis. 
``city without theaters is like a blind, is like a face without the eyes.`` 
Image of the suggested director Giuseppem Tornatorem successfully document, what is happening in large of Italian urban centres, but also the rural town. 
The process of reduction theaters, the birth of large multisálů on the outskirts of and the following the demise of monosálů in central zones of cities, is one of the events which seem to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all of the characters a genuine cultural crime. 
Often disappear historical space charged memories, ``it's as if they came to a friend, a well - known, with which we share of the way and very emotions``, feeling director of new kina Paradiso, film, which twenty years ago gained Tornatorovi Oscar and grand jury price in Cannes, and which he told poetry one of village cinemas and sadness because of the way of life, who lost about cinema forever. 
The values obtained Anecem, the main body of operators, is clear: in the last five years, closed the door 316 theaters tip of the traditional, and the highest account paid for the rooms, in particular, in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, on 9 in Milaně, Naples, Bologna and Rome, of 6 less in Toríně, on 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions of the most affected closings the Emilia - romagna with a loss of 82 kinových room, followed by Tuscany (44) and (Lombardy (41). 
And proof that the first responsible for their disappearance of is the emergence of sclerosis, are in these three of the Italian regions, which registered the highest number of new kinových multisálů: on the 195 canvas more in Lombardy in the past five years, 81 as in Tuscany, so in Emilia - Romagně. 
``Italian procedure shall be developed a rational » says Paolo Protti, President Anecu,`` it is useful to create a new structure, but it would need to guarantee that the already existing will survive because, when one cinema in the city of closes, not all his visitors are willing to go to the sclerosis. 
Then or Don 't let us on the lack of a subsidy for the Fund in favour of operators: previous government debt is roughly 10 million euros. 
In the light of the moral and ethical is a shame that the government's existing laws. 
In support of the sector would be the need to between 16 and 18 million euros per year. 
Interesting bolognský is the case, the first of the Italian city to worry about the closings and which has decided to find out the signature of the protokulu between communities and Anecem, the first of this type in Italy to the protection and promotion of small theaters in both the historical centres, as in the suburbs. 
Between the planned standards are steps tax relief in favour of operators and benefits for the audience as regards the mobility of the: viewers will be able to go to a zone with limited transport and will have to stop and special prices on some parking lots. 
« this initiative I like it » says Giuseppe Tornatore ``and I hope that the other cities will follow the example of Bologna by the introduction of other measures ». 
However, it is certain that it was not possible to stand up against the great power sclerosis, traditional halls shall improve the quality of sound and pictures, because today ’ s audience is difficult. 
Defending the traditional kina is subject, and for all important: the conclusion of the super cinemas in Bagherii, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convincing inject ``new cinema Paradiso``, of which I thought already 10 years. 
I live in Rome already 25 years, and when scanning before already closed Rialtem or Quirinalem in the street nazionale, where I share as much emotion, to watch the inscriptions blackened dust, turned to the other side. `` 
The connection between the policies and a group of 'ndrangheta, the mayor in prison Gioie tauro 
``the mayor of Gioie tauro was willing to edit the local magistracy referred to in the interests of the mafia groups Piromalli``. 
The charge that Directorate against the Mafia raised in Calabria against the Master and vicestarostovi Gioie tauro Giorgiovi Torrione gave e Rosariovi Schiavone, and Master Rosarna Carl martelli imprisoned, this morning for external cooperation with the mafia organization, are heavy. 
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between clans and the public administration, and his grandson of the lawyer, same boss, already accused of the commission of crimes mafia nature, who was going to the payment of EUR 10 million. 
``ignore all legal and moral standards, as well as the common sense,`` wrote a national representatives, when two local authorities have expressed his readiness to pay the consultations lawyer Piromallimu. 
``I would mafia group to - write judges – formally enter the city's offices and facilitate already so huge check options and management of the public administration``. 
President kalábrijské regional the Commission Agazio Loiero does not hide that ``the secret of agreements between the local institutions and organised criminal underworld is in its edge of the very:`` are the area in which it is the concentration of the mafia stronger than in other, where is the secret of the Agreement of the inevitable. 
But there are also many local politicians who resist pressure 'ndranghety, heroes who are still staining ``. 
Imprisonment of that morning, follow imprisonment of July last year, which police has shown that a group of Piromalli got the final action. 
From the end of April last year - urban the Council Gioii tauro dissolved was already since 1991, the reason was I had anticipated a link between organised crime and local administration - were local politicians deprived of functions in the municipal administration. 
Giorgio he Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of the dissolution was elected head of center - right coalition after the closer election in May. 
He cried because of the scandal, when she ordered a prefecture dissolution of the Council. 
He called to the responsibility of then deputy Minister of the Interior and Marcus Minnitiho accused him that all the framed from political reasons, but judges in the Regulation on the imprisonment signed this morning he explain that a group has come even so far, he asked for the change of the project highway A3. 
Of the other questioning of mandated to give Torrionovi, wrote a public prosecutors, got out ``willingness to move the rights of the proprietor, a representative of a large group of very close to what is generally known, Piromallimu and to adapt the public policy of the interests of the mafia group.% quot%. 
When the energy emerge from the waves, to enter the those great game. 
It is the endless bearing, which covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface, and now he was beginning to appear large world energy companies. 
Waves, streams, inflows of, the tide are new sources of energy, to which the inexhaustible contemplating behemoths of the eyes like chevron, who was to these resources now seeking to lay hands. 
The option to create energy from the movements of the sea is studied for more than a hundred years, and, in the 1970 s in connection with the first oil crisis research intensifying. 
When the price of oil reduced around 1980, the idea of the sea to the use of energy went away. but now environmental organisations and new increase in oil prices could sector of a new impulse. 
World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007, he said about 15 percent of the world consumption of electricity could be covered by using the movement of waves of the sea. 
This would be twice the amount of energy, which is currently produced in nuclear centres. 
In addition, there are even currents and tides. 
Giants attacks. 
The company, which bet on the sea energy, was Enersis, which shall be in 2005 will agreed that the device in Northern Portugal. 
When he was reported this intention, it looked like a huge revolutionary step. 
After two years, as is betting on sea energy, is still more companies that betting on the sea energy rather than to the energy traditional. 
``chevron studied the technology of energy oceans – said a spokesman for one of the company, which is linked to an oil juggernaut of the United States, in economic daily newspapers Wall Street Journal – and thought about the options cooperate with us.`` 
Cooperation on which dreaming of relates to obtain authorisation by the U. S. the Commission for energy, which is necessary for the take - up of the project to the use of energy of the sea in Alaska. 
This signal we can underestimated, especially when taking into account that it is in Alaska to benefit the US oil and President Bush recently came to the plan to new drilling. 
In addition to the chevron monitor the track of marine energy and Verdant power Inc., New York and ocean power from New Jersey, and yet invested money, even if they are not fully known, show by observers growing interest. 
've inflicted technology, is the need to develop. 
Experts speak of technology, which is still in began, because he knows what impact will have the use of the sea of energy to the environment. 
In the meantime, the establishments in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and there appears to be a big problems ecosystem. 
For the greater energy production is but the technology to be used with more impact on the prosředí. 
The methods are different: ocean power, for example, the system uses the fear that are linked between them. 
The strength of the waves, which moving with buoys up and down, is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside the buoys. 
An engine pressure turbines, which supplies the energy generator. 
Energy is on the bank submarine cables. 
In the meantime, are in the project phase four device of this type, which only waiting at the federal approval and part of energy could be used for military purposes. 
On the contrary, Verdant power has now produces energy to purchase the Centre and the parking lot the use of six pdmořských turbines in the New York East River. 
The movement of water during the influx of the low - water and causes of rotation turbines, which the secret panel live on the movement of the generator. 
Verdant said that they have long list of clients who are waiting for the necessary authorization due to the possibility of the use of the energy. 
After the waves, and after the influx of the low - water. 
The special interests in this time and deserves the potential of the low - water mark, say in research Institute of electrical energy. 
Although it is a discontiguous factor, tides are predictable than the wind, the sun or wool, and thus and reliable as a source of energy. 
It was in the low - water and energy of the States as the New York, Maine and Alaska, and with other coastal States already invested $7 and a half milinonu in 2008 and predicted investment to 35 million in the year 2009.
