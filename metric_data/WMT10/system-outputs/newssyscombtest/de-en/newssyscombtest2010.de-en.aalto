Schneemangel on the mountains, hotel owners bedeviled
Scneelose considers sorgenn make not only the riesengebirgen-anwohnern.
The lack of snow frightens people of appointment of the skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions.
We can therefore in Giant Mountains are still free room for all wintertermine. Christmas and New Year's Eve in cl.
Our parties are often.
The people, the offers, the prices, but now you have to fear, binding.
And if you ask us to immediately, whether we think this year's Christmas for snow matsch 'or' will be led by the operators of the informationsportals spindl.info, Martin jandura.
Anyone who silvester-aufenthalt in the spindelmühle precisely that should no longer with the appointment.
Anyone who prefers the SAVE and the quality of the stay in second place, can try to wait a few days.
The spindelmühle-hotelbesitzer offer now for the New Year's Eve day largely only wochenaufenthalte.
I think that you are, for a time, sell it, but then they too must give in, and shorter times.
And then the free room quickly, jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winterterminen always provides must always be the travel agency ingtours in vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the weihnachtswoche, which has still not be sold out.
We offer is about half the seats are still.
We have therefore already some cheaper weihnachtsaufenthalte prepared for the last time, the director of the travel agencies ingtours, Petr schiefert.
The New Year's Eve day in Giant Mountains can also offer the vrchlabi-reisebüro yet, but there is much less free seats.
Good (also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining wintertermine an average.
This year is the interest of the winteraufenthalte negatively affected by that Giant Mountains is no snow.
The people are waiting, whether snow.
Nobody wants to the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should the considers within a week verschneit, will also be sold out this Christmas, schiefert.
And something better than last year, manages the room in the hotel horizon in pecpod snezkou.
We are about to five per cent more than in the previous year.
On New Year's Eve of Christmas day and we have only a few rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in the janua in February, and the business will also go well informed of the director of the best pec-hotels Karel Rada.
80% of the silvesteraufenthalte is also the hotel Omnia in zentralparkplatz in janske lazne occupied.
Remains Christmas in the latest hotel in janske lazne half the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us in this year of January, for which we currently have occupied approximately 60%.
A bit weaker is now the February, but the moment when the snow, is certainly the interest in Giant Mountains, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik sporysch.
On a more schneebescherung are the riesengebirge-hotelbesitzer now.
On Thursday if it is cool and if rainfall, this should the mountains snow.
But then again come to a warming informed Jiri jakubsky from the site of the Czech wetteramtes in Hradec kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comic, with what schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the issue of repeatedly, even for the most stupid.
As he has, afghanistan-doktrin ausschwitzte awaited, it was that it on the kopierpapier from the busch-irak-szenariovor abschrieb three years.
Not only is it in the text itself the saying goes, "as in Iraq", he has even the name of the bush- declaration of January 2007 as the name of its own declaration: 'new vorwärtsweg "without hesitation.
He has even three years ago the bush-idee - fresh troop contributions in the troubled by the civil war to Iraq - a 'irresponsible and in its conclusions karastrophische decision'.
Subsequent months showed, however, that the recommendations of the military lands that the only possible and insofar as a great success that it is now in the news about Iraq no longer.
The reputation of Bush's this has not improved because, objectively, he has a much dankbarere his successor hintergelassen starting point, as it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan hopes Barack Obama's miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent have asked him again the military, especially the oberkommandeur the afghanistan-operation general Stanley mccristal, even despite the subordinationsgewohnheiten the hesitation the protect severely criticised in the White House.
He called for 40 000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The President has three months, but with no better idea and he has the general wenistens about 10 000 soldiers.
Europe, the promise of another 5,000 pressed, even if he at least 10 000 originally expected.
Highly problematic about the whole obama-strategie is its projects, the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and withdraw this process within three years to complete the whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt about the halved increase the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Despite the civil war of recent years is the irak-gesellschaft relatively well structured, its leaders honour the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the kontraindikation - no one can be assured and there are no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces which are accustomed to change their mind every day.
The political institutions, even if they were established formally correct, only scheinbauten, behind which the patriarchal stammbeziehungen further out can excel.
The balance between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions that the Pakistan- and iran-einflüsse even more complex.
The building of a "strong state ', which is the minimum objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time frame of the obama-strategie surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan only worse and now it is on the brink of the explosion.
We believe that the small soldiers in the warlike proclamations on the 'frühheimkehr', is a miracle, can only create a truly romantic soul, not influenced by facts.
From the political point of view, the datumssetzung for redeployment pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The recent NATO Summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans, to combat in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians can and want to their voters will not explain how the security Germany or Italy with the war in hindukusch-gebirgsvorland.
Another possible factor, the situation is radically can influence the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work, the United States is a very difficult question whether the problem with troops would solve.
The question that must be answered in the period in which America after Obama to siegerabzug from Afghanistan.
Any solution will but also a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only sop to Barack Obama is the fact that three years until the presidential election, and thus there is still enough time to enable it to a different strategy can fallls this as totalausfall.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs receive no prämienboni more in cash
The chief executives of American bank Goldman Sachs in this year no prämienboni more in cash.
This has announced the company to the sharp criticism of their lohnpraktiken.
A group of 30 spitzenmanagern instead of money will be but only in five years can sell.
Furthermore, the shares the managers in the event that if you excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is so under the Reuters news agency at the forefront of efforts, the prämieboni Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on further direction is aware, in which it has to go, the former bankers society JP Morgan, Mr Elliott.
The problem is in the details, it added.
Goldman Sachs, the target of criticism, having for the first three quarters of this year nearly $17 billion for prämienboni had set aside.
The total amount of prämienboni during this jahra Reuters news agency will probably also in spite of today and measure 20 billion dollars.
The high prämienboni in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders the most political issue.
Britain has reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of bankers, exceed the 25,000 pound, unique with a tax of 50%.

Minister janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him in the Burg
President Vaclav Klaus receives on Friday morning, the Finance Minister Eduard janota, on his will remain in the government, because it with the implementation of the budgets for the next year in the form which this by the Assembly on Wednesday released, does not agree with.
It is accepted that the budget and perhaps by janota remain in office, the issues of the freitagstreffens.
The budget is also of Klaus.

In Parliament, but on Wednesday linkspartei-vorschläge geldumwälzung to vote and the money for the staatsbeamtengehälter, for the maintenance of social services and direktlöhne of farmers.
The government has objected to the proposals of the Social Democrats, hides the budget deficit.
The Left Party between, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and Justice Party, on the other hand, is a severe domestic political dispute arose because the question marks about the further work of the fischer-beamtenkabinetts, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by Parliament, virtually wiped out the package of measures on the part of the fischer- government was implemented in the autumn, and that it understood the public debt.
Klaus, of the law of the state budget can sign but need not, said today in the diskussionsfrühstück with entrepreneurs that the politicians' serious problem, "the" the unsustainable deficit "of public finances, longer time have neglected.
In his opinion, there is not a good solution.
An improvement could only a strong government, which is still on a broader consensus of the political parties could build.
The ods-vorsitzende Mirek Topolanek, led to that this budget is appalling, and the government should consider their continued existence.
The ods-stellvorsitzende, Petr necas, said the ctk that the concept of the beamtenkabinetts CSSD, with the support of the grünenpartei ODS and do not work.
Prime Minister Fischer, editorial similar words as a "strong worry."
The cssd-chef, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the topolanek-worte that the etatdefizit horrifying is that the previous government of Topolanek for this year, and that 200 billion kronor.
Wednesday rated CSSD the approval of the budgets for the coming year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in new film by clint East wood of Morgan freeman played
The South Africans claim that the new hollywood-film 'invictus: the ungeschlagene "the world much of the country shows that fight and win despite some criticisms that the role of an American actors appointments.
History tells of sport, rassenverhältnissen and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid-regierungssystem in the South African Republic and its first black President Nelson Mandela, observes in his History of the American oscar-schauspieler, Morgan freeman.
Freeman said, that the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether it, in the eastwood- film.
A further important role Matt Damon.
I said to him: 'If you will, I must play.
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, the price for his role in the eastwood-drama from the boxbereich 'baby' million dollars had already asked the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, in the end the slave-masters, has become a fictitious usa-präsidenten, and also in God 'van omnipotent', but rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people as important as Mandela.
The former südafrikanischestaatsmann was for his active work in the end of apartheid in the South African Republic 27 years in prison.
It was in 1990 undfür released in four years, he has been President of the country.
In 1993 it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
'invictus' is the Latin word for 'ungeschlagen', and at the same time it is the name of a gedichtes English author Ernest henley William in the years 1875 was issued.
The requirement to speak, as he was
The film recounts a true story in the Nelson Mandela of its forces with the captain of the South African rugbyteams, Francois pienaar, together, in order to reach the country's new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still rassenmäßig shared and economically.
He believes that his people through sport is, therefore, the rugbyspieler decides it around the world to outsiders,.
Finally, the South African team to the World Cup of 1995.
Free we worked for several years, the mandela-geschichte to the cinema out.
He had no objective other than this role to play, such as closely as possible to the reality, said freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he has.
The actors said, if he and the world leader in the same country, he would try to Mandela meeting with him to eat tonight and in his speech behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him, Mandela to shake hands.
I noticed when I give you the schüttele, I accept your energy, it will, and I had the feeling that I know what they feel, he said.
It is important to me, one other person.
Matt Damon, the film François pienaar, captain of the national rugbyteams, in which the white players on dust.
The actors said that he had six months for the role in the hard rugbywelt.
It was for him a great surprise, as he pienaar met for the first time in this House.
I remember when I to the türklingel rang that he opened up and the first thing I to François pienaar in my life was: 'in the film I see much bigger'.

The start, however, was not successful as a type bulava "and the" missile, initially the pride of the Russian army, is becoming a nightmare of Russian generals and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence on the ground in the raketetest has had no positive effect on the success of the probeflüge.
Bulava is generally not launched or in the air been damaged.
In the Russian newspapers, one on 'bulava' than 'a missile, not flies. "
A missile, but is not the
This was already 13 attempt, at the beginning of normal.
Until the end of the journey, in turn, technical damage to the missile.
Probably the engine exploded in the third raketenstufe.
This time, "bulava 'from the nuclear submarine Dmitry donskij under the water of the White Sea haulage.
This raketentyp facilitates the shooting down of the submarine.
It is likely that a vagueness fliegendes object caused mysterious light on nordwegen indeed the damaged 'bulava'.
The Norwegians since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian missile.
The generals, diesesmal challenged and claims that it does not clearly from a failure.
The first two stages of the missile fell from and the accident was not only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage.
Even if no teststart without mistake was made, the leadership of the Ministry of only six of thirteen for unsuccessful.
The almost 50% success therefore fulfilled the generals with optimism and will continue to be claimed that the "bulava again fly without problems and even ten hyperschall-atomsprengköpfe with a maximum authorised mass of Max. 1.15 tonnes.

Czech discovery: one substance, as opposed to tempered ´ HIV viruses were transmitted,
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new links the spread of HIV viruses were transmitted in organism should stop.
The main advantage of improved substance is that, at the viruses works that are resistant to medicines.
This fact, against the disadvantage that the link to normal virus-varianten not so much, as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot yet be cured.
The patients, the medikamentenzusammenstellung but life extend and the increase in the number of HIV viruses were transmitted in the body.
Their use, but of a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete oppression of virus-vermehrung has also the development of g. Resistentviren, against the medication is more effective.
The work of the experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences cr, of the vscht (chemisch-technologische University) Prague and of the university in Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus-resistenz.
You have shown that the metalokarborane described substances on the eiweißstoff, the proliferation of hiv-viruses is responsible.
The metalokarborane are links on boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These links are virus-vermehrung in a different way than all used today medicines, so they can overcome the resistenz-problem.
In its work, the scientists to new ´ improved ´ links, based on the knowledge of the molekularmechanismus their attachment to the viren-eiweißstoff were prepared.
The metalokarborane have a unique three one-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from bor-, hydrogen and kohlenstoff-atomen and by a metall-atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
Heinous and constant virus
Hiv-protease is eiweißstoff of HIV, for the life cycle of the virus is essential.
Without the hiv-virus-spaltung caused by the hiv-protease would not infektionsvirenpartikel tyres.
If we hiv-protease do we reject the reproduction of the virus in the body of the patients, explain the scientists in the press report by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry the Academy of Sciences cr was issued.
In the work in the wissenschaftszeitung Journal of medicinal chemistry was published, describe the scientists whole ranks of links, in which two couples of cages (see table) in a short organic chain are linked to systematically further.
A weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances on the hiv-protease wurdne in reagenz glass tested, including their constant (resistant) variants of HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metalokarborane in the usual enzym-variante is not as strong as the clinical use medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the resistentvarianten, against the use of medicines often ineffective.
The unique wirkungsmechanismus and its characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical impact, the metalokarboranen to interesting links for further on the development of effective medicines to combat HIV directed research, says pavlina rezacova, head of the laboratories for strukturbiologie the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and of the Institute for molecular genetics the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute about budget. ODS was to fishermen, the Fights Back
The chairman of the ODS Mirek Topolanek, called the licensed budget for next year than 'atrocious' and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, their continued existence.
The statement of ODS called the Prime Minister of a "strong worry."
It is time for the analysis.

After necas the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends, in the minority, when it comes to the battle against a rising deficit, or whether it be to remain in office through the parlamentlinken.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to necas differently.
Parliament has, on Wednesday, the budget for the year 2010, but with linkpartei-änderungsvorschlägen on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for staatsbeamtengehälter, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has the proposals of the Social Democrats is told that it covers the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic, a backlog of 163 billion kronor economies.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, it is the wish of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budgetprovisoriums frase not clear.
Disappointment and futility
The Finance Minister Eduard janota, on his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas premier Jan Fischer has stated that the government of the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if janota seriously with his resignation of the case, would have threatened the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
In accordance with the Czech TV has janota on Monday to the regierungsgeschäft the Prime Minister.
He has indicated that he be considered further to remain in office.
So is his disappointment on the verhandugn of budget.
To what extent are fishermen for the continuing fight with the budget-defizit, have necas pursuant to the nominanten the Social Democrats (CSSD), the changes in the budget had obtained in the government to do nothing.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he would resign if Parliament continues to defizit-steigernde legislation, for example, the sickness pay and pensions or the dienstgesetzesnovelle.
Topolanek: the ODS nominated ministers were proved wrong not
It is a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ODS nominated ministers have not made mistakes, has Topolanek in a textmeldung from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy role everyone sitting on top 09, which voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen ür decides on the fight against defizit-höhe of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is on the left, the majority in Parliament. '
Then he allegedly with the support and tolerance of citizens democrats.
I have not thought about, and if the topical, I shall look into this matter, said the of the citizens Democrats nominated Defence Minister Martin bartak journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer was flying afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS at the request of the Prime Minister came back
Necas stressed that the ODS probably on Wednesday in the European Parliament were to vote against the amended budget if the premier members of citizens Democrats explicitly asking that the adoption of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS in political negotiation of the budget by the absence of the leader of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic has not diminished.
I have not noticed that my vote.
As I already on the mandate, I knew that, in coming months, particularly for division of the Parliament and destruction of all positive, reacted Topolanek itself.

For the lokalzüge and fast trains, the railways is a zehnjahresvertrag newly signed the Treaty just for a year ago.
The railways praises the system, perhaps it is not to increase in the great majority of the tickets to passengers.
It is only to changes in one-day netzfahrscheinen CD net and favourable internetfahrscheinen eliska.
For passengers without the kundenkarte will the price CD net of 450 Crowns to 600 Crowns.
The price eliska will then depend on the dangers of pro-enlargement until now it was for the journey between any bezirkstädten uniformly and cost SEK 160.

Jancura complaint and slander against three heads of CSSD.
The owners of the student agency, radim jancura today complaint, slander against three sozial-demokratische leaders.
I am against Al hasek from the district südmähren, Radko Martin Ek from the district pardubice and the head of the district olomouc, Martin tesarik.
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen inteview in radiojournal.
The complaint is linked to the effort of the company, the regionalzugverkehr in certain districts.
All regions, but in the end the long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three head resort to us and say that we pick the cherries, we have the offer only on the scope, as it with you.
They claim that we expensive than the Czech railways, because we are the prices of the Czech railways would know, the last week.
So, we have no choice but to us.
Because of this defamation of society student Agency said jancura the radiojournal.

Vaccination against pneumokokken free and voluntary
Imfung against pneumokokken change from January the usual.
It is a first for the families free and voluntary.
However, already have votes that the pflicht-impfung would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumokokken culminate.
The arzneiinstitut is already the maximum prices of vaccines which health insurance.
The experts are also on the impfungsverfahren.
New vaccination
Vaccines for august-kinder free
From January children can be vaccinated against pneumokokken free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition, that you do not yet impfdosis.
Anyone with the vaccination in last year or earlier, must also pay weiterewiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first impfdosis must between 3 and 5 life month of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families their children against pneumokokken vaccination.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the recent children are four doses.
On the whole, the experts, the health insurance for the vaccination doses to SEK 300, 000 per year.
But the treatment they save the children without vaccination needed.
Until now, the state for all flächenimpfungen of children around 500 000 per year.
The pflicht-impfung was introduced with the so-called "janota-paket.
Pneumokokken mittelohrentzündung cause, but also serious infections including gehirnhautentzündungen and blutvergiftung.
By pneumokokkeninfektionen die with us after investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic, the pflicht-impfung of children against pneumokokken in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccination duty?
At the same time, it is said that these vaccination in future duty could be.
From January this by insurance paid and voluntary.
The pflicht-impfung would be better mentioned, for example, the head of the bürgervereinigung nahlas, Rudolf kalovsky.
Its association, even in the long term for the pneumokokken-impfung.
The experts in the international conference, in which our group was involved were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not an ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed, at least the.
I believe that this is the road we must take, now led kalovsky.
But the Ministry of the impfverfahren against pneumokokken cannot change.
At this moment we do not consider this to be vlastimil spokesman said sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, claim the doctors.
The chairman of the fachgesellschaft of practical kinderärzten, of cabrnochova, that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children would be vaccinated, then we could reflect on the reduction of wiederholungsimpfungszahl 'in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive that we understand the political decision that this vaccination as a voluntary initiative, "says allerdingst cabrnochova.
The experts expect more than 80% of parents their babies against pneumokokken inoculated from next year.
Vaccination against pneumokokken is ground-breaking that this first disease of the health insurance, and not the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money for the prevention, thus save them for further treatment, erkärt cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines itself.
This is a concern of the practical children doctors, which in the purchase of vaccines.
After the original plans should vaccines by insurers are purchased doctors and then in the same way as other by the state to you the vaccines.
Some Members were afraid, however, that the insurance as "the money from the krankenversicherungherausführen".
Therefore, the doctors vaccines even buying and wait until the insurance them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors must invest SEK 40 000 per month, which is a significant figure.
This will not be easy, cabrnochova says.

Can the Islam French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss electorate for a ban on building on minarets and which concern about the Islamisation of Europe is widespread, John bowen, an American academics, a thorough and thoughtful report written about whether Muslims in one of the säkularisiertesten which can be integrated into European societies – and integrated.
Some readers of this new book admiration for the work of the author: "why the French not scarves love" (originaltitel: "why the French don 't like headscarves') (2006), an elegant and densely argumentierenden study of a dispute that the country has one and a half decades and workers and their effects are still exercise.
Bowens neustes book provides a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum.
As a good anthropologist would he not only know what the politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is really going on.
He has months in mosques, schools and colleges, which is now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it bowen calls "Islamic space '.
It is a good listener, debates between teachers and students on the issues that most concern.
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a Council House marry (or both)?
Should young Muslims on evolution and rights of homosexuals deal?
Can a Muslim women not Muslim man wed?
It is for a Muslim, a zinsorientiertes banking system to make use of a mortgage?
It is this seemingly down-to-earth affairs, he claims, which daily life, contrary to the political drama, the media.
The author recognises a new generation, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known names, possibly with the exception of tarik Ramadan, born in Switzerland Arab-Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation trying to open the debate on how it is possible, on the one hand, a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizens in a modern secular society.
They have not all arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists bowen respondents, are often at odds with their salafi-gegenstücken – the pure and simple internationalist Sunni Islam with Saudi Arabia in – which is a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires give and take on both sides.
It is in question, whether the French policymakers (and the intellectual elite, the passionate the separation of Church and State guarded) really pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims perhaps a rough treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn their historic compromise with the secular republicanism had to make.
It is rather a tightening of the werteschrauben "as a growing pragmatism.
Can the Islam French? following the reading of this book is inclined to say 'yes, but not yet'.
The trostloseste outlook of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other umweltregion on earth.
It marks the ice is melting at an alarming rate, and life that nowhere else can survive.
Oil, gas, schifffahrts- and fishing interests in the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers, and now also authors in its wake.
Mr Elles, an author and illustrator, is in "walking on thin ice '(originaltitel:' on thin ice ') a history of the icon of the North, the polar bears.
Exercised in the complex history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of arktiserforscher themselves in the quest for the polar bears.
Admiral nelsons meeting with a polar bears as brave 14-year-old fähnrich at sea, the only with the rifle butt of its muskete fought, is certainly a myth, but others are true.

Ellis relates to the reports of other authors and historian and, often to the threat, the hunting for the survival of the species.
Although in Norway, America and Russia, the cull is banned in Greenland and Canada - where hunters in helicopters and motorschlitten-fahrende Inuit powerful assault rifles use their prey to route.
Ironically, the waters of the North of those two jagdnationen the longest remain.
In his new book 'after the ice' (originaltitel 'after the ice'), alun Anderson, a former editor of the wissenschaftsmagazins "new scientist", a clear and alarming description of the science of the Arctic and a packenden insight into how the future could develop.

The news of the arrest was first Friday night in the New York Times reported.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will provide a contribution, if the Cuban Government concrete steps in this direction, as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebook into Cuba legally, even though they are new and coveted products in a country in which the average earnings of government officials $15 per month.
The Cuban Government has allowed this year ordinary citizens, the purchase of a mobile phone, mainly for the sending of text messages, as a 15-minütiges telephone call a daily wage costs.

Pakistani government representatives cover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading heads a conspiracy to five men from nord-virginia to Afghanistan in order to send us soldiers to kill, and said that they hope that this case would help, a network of terrorist recruiting sergeant that led the Internet after radicalised young men.

Saifullah after they have arrived in Pakistan, the leader of this men and tried to help them stammesgürtel remote area in Pakistan, the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence, and the matter has been informed, said on Saturday, the al-kaida-führer saifullah could not persuade that men does not form part of a cia-verschwörung to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were on days in the eastern city sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the North-West, the terroristenzufluchtsstätte.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
You have therefore been rejected, said the government officials, because of the sensitivity of the matter to remain anonymous.
The government has said that the men were not discouraged and continue to have the right to be given access to the al-kaida-lagern, than the Pakistani prison authorities have been arrested.
The case of the five men - which remains in Pakistan and the FBI be consulted underlines the vital role of recruitment agencies in the identification of terrorists and perhaps more importantly, the decision, who deserve to be trusted.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate "action"
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the bella-kongresszentrum the city kühneres action on climate change.
Demonstrators said that 100 000 people had joined the event, whereas the polizeischätzungen rather of around 25, 000.
The event is relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small in the vicinity of some government buildings in the inner city zündete.
One day, when the promoted by the UN climate negotiations little happened, thousands of activists with transparent through the city in which, in English, "there is no planet B 'and one in Spanish, has stated that' the world says' enough '.
Some stars, the protest, for example the Danish model, the fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the land of their birth mother, you see what heartrending problems the country because of the already perceptible impact of climate change.
This is one of the reasons why I have decided to take on the major demonstration to participate - to speak and to pass the world leaders to call a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way of around it.
The police, the demonstrators, get too close to the bella-zentrum and said that they had 19 people were arrested, mainly due to the fact that they are either hooded goods or taschenmesser mitführten.
Under Danish law, these actions in demonstrations.
According to a spectator, are not mentioned, because it is involved in the negotiations on climate change, zündeten disguised demonstrators in black clothing several in the vicinity of the Copenhagen hauptkanals, near where several ministries.

He was then it is continuing and said: "because the venue, I cannot hear, which happens'.
He stated that it from the perspective of individual hillsides, whether the demonstration damage or would help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and of various sectors in the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, we can also say that the negotiations or the freedom of others annoy '.
Prüfungsdaten show rassenkluft persistent
The certificates to mathematikleistung were last week welcome good news for the public schools in Washington that C.
Although the district Washington still lags behind the schools of the country, the maximum benefits to produce the evidence to show that the viert- and achtklässler in the last two years faster progress than cities, the Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But in the latest figures of national assessment of the bildungsfortschritts (national assessment of education Al progress - naep) is included, is the persistent leistungskluft between African-American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The average level of the White viertklässler from Washington that C. rose in the last two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) their African-American peer groups, but only three points of 209 to 212.
In reality, the leistungskluft between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American achtklässler remained basically, he was a statistically negligible point of 245 to 244.
The average level of white student was not in the test data because the stichprobenumfang not big enough.
The picture of a six-year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first naep in this district ’ fraud 60 skalenpunkte (262 to 202).
And although the point number, the children of both groups have achieved during this period and the difference with now 58 points scarcely decreased.
Some of bildungsbefürworter expressed last week its concern that the results of schulkanzlerin Michelle example rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. fenty was celebrated, for the most part of white pupils, the already powerful children, were driven forward.
This means that we gesamtwertung through the treatment of those at the top end of the scale have increased, as problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, Member of the board of D.C. voice, a nonprofit group for the bildungsgleichheit in Washington that C..
I will not for a period of two or three points and, said the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, a subsidiary of the fourth category of eaton-grundschule.
Brown, a frequent critics of the managementstils of rhee, said that the message of the prüfungspunktzahlen is that resources schools of the city of urgent attention.
Of course we would like to see the positive signs, I respect.
I fear, however, is that we do not spend the time and energy that we would have to commit to our mittelschule.
Rhee said, the district must continue, better ways for the needs of the performance weak pupils.
This autumn, for example, some teachers trained, a new leselehrplan, the wilson-lese-system, that of pupils in the upper classes of primary school and mittelschule, which basic skills of reading not at the start of its schullaufbahn have carried out and the significant behind their young counterparts classes comrades.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from nursery school until the sixth class games and lebensechte experience, was under the former chief schulinspektor clifford janey to Washington and the curriculum, some of the naep-fortschritte, the last week were reported.
I believe that we still need to work to the best measures for the pupils benefit under the notenniveau, said rhee.
Others say that the naep-ergebnisse highlight the question whether rhee can continue, the overall efficiency of the system and continue to improve the extra money and resources for the performance weak schools can provide the necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle rhee Bruce fact, said he, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the urban audit results.
The conventional medicine is its resources and management reforms in schools, in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could political aftermath, advocating against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point is of course, as in other urban school inspectors that they are trying to white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We must strengthen our schools in the areas, so that all families, irrespective of where they live, can be sure that their children excellent public education.
Janey now schulinspektor in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to the closure of the leistungskluft is the traditional public school year in Washington, which currently 180 days, to extend to compete with the charter-schulen.
It is the school year on nearly 200 days in force for change, janey said in his teachers' Union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone on the road to a greater increase in the next Treaty.

The College in Pennsylvania was the 7, the children to their three-day tour visited and now they have the intended message fully: the question is not whether's College.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the US hispanischer immigrants who do not finish high school or a teenager become pregnant, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands, what the collegeausbildung that is needed in the middle class.
In truth, one in five of the second generation of hispanoamerikaner the College – what a remarkable achievement, because so many of its immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico and Central America, the United States, without the high school have finished.
Their success stories are important, researchers, because for a generation, which is a huge role in the workforce of the country will be the way forward.
Those who powerful children, say that this very often have a natural affinity for school and a its inherent momentum to success.
Many of you have also parents and their children to set high targets and find ways to their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But beratungsprogramme also play a major role in graciela and millions of children as they help in college, especially if these efforts for long periods of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents have not experience and skills in the wegsuche through the system to help, we will then have a single measure at any time does not solve the problem, Mrs gándara, researchers in at the University of California at Davis, the hispanoamerikanische students studied.
We need to consider for these children a support network of pre-school and by the high school.

The leading envoy of the UN in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday to resign from his post in March, which will be a stormy term would end the allegations of widespread corruption in the UN support Afghan presidential election has been tarnished.
Egg of redundancy, as the Obama administrations has decided to further 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
UN special representative said that he supports the truppenerhöhung, but he expressed his concern about the fact that the us-zeitplan for the military withdrawal that in 18 months is to begin, other nato-regierungen could lead to withdraw its forces.
We need to speed up the construction of the Afghan security forces and, consequently, the right signal to the Afghans, that the international community can trust, said Eide during a radio interview from Kabul.
This commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat, the United States and other military powers, the number of international civilian workers to increase in the political changeover of Afghanistan.
The truppenerhöhung on the military side must an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that one step, but only in March 2008 his family to grant agreement, only two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification of UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now so he have time for a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to seek a successor, said Eide.
When I arrived here, there was a zweimonatiges vacuum between the redundancy of my predecessor and I arrived.
Ban has un-vertretern pursuant to the search for a replacement.
The UN representative say that he schwedisch-italienisch-stämmigen Staffan di Mistura, recently led the United Nations mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, has led the un-friedensoperationen took into consideration.

Eide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - the fired - 'the mission certainly damage, because a great deal of scepticism about the international interference in the election was'.

The un-regeln are designed in such a way that I since May, he said, only one person could.
That is disastrous and must not continue.
US Secretary of Defense gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
M. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be "significant additional sanctions on Iran, because it does not impose in discussions on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates spoke during a 7-tägigen journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of approximately 300 US troops in northern Iraq and the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran are not good opportunities for election, he said in response to the question of soldiers to the likelihood of such a development.
"one of the items on the soul, is that if we in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war own unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama administrations prefers a sanktionspaket in recital to the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates announced that some sanctions might affect the durchschnittsiraner.
He said that a 'package of positive and negative incentives' need 'to the Iranian Government to with nuclear weapons in reality is less protected', because "their people monsters' from the sanctions will suffer.
On Friday, in an opinion by the Speaker of the White House, Robert gibbs, the American Government the European political leaders in the warning, that Iran with "credible 'consequences if it with its nuclear programme is not the demands of the UN Security Council and its atom-überwachungsorganisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of the nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes should be won.
During the talks in Geneva on 1 October said Iran that he talks on restriction of its nuclear programme and to resume a substantial part of its lagerbestands to depleted uranium in exchange for much-needed nuklearbrennstoff for his medical research reactor would forgo.
The US government has to this type of agreement, that of trust between the two parties and time for negotiations.
Iran, however, since then the negotiations to the provisional agreement to have left -- partly say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether they should commit to the United States.
That Iran the international community with regard to some of the proposals, which they had already agreed at the beginning of October, simply left, has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way, as you brought in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran were never said gates.
President Obama has the 31 dez. deadline for Iran, to respond to these proposals before other options, including the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Rod who "overwhelming sanctions', will continue.
In a statement in New York, Iran's representation at the United Nations, which you on Thursday 'groundless and well-founded allegations' certain members of the Security Council to the Iranian atomaktivitäten called and said that they are ready, the talks with the United States and five other world powers, "an appropriate long-term solution '.
Gates, last Friday should return to Washington, met on tomorrow with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki it, before the oil rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meeting with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities representatives in Irbil.
The tension between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides, the potential for conflict, in order to prevent delays the us-pläne, the American troops by the end of August by 115 000 to 50 000.
Gates also sought, the Kurdish concerns about the impending withdrawal. Us-vertreter quoted gates to Ma sudden Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will their security, prosperity and their autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave. "
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang weijia and her husband, surrounded by propagandaplakaten to lecture them that 'mother earth is too tired to have more children' and 'a baby more means a grave. "
These lessons have you learned that, than government officials in Shanghai, by the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer suddenly began to change course and young couples ermunterten, more than to have a child, your reply immediately and permanently was: 'In any case'.
We already have all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child is nothing more, said Wang, 31, a personalleiterin with a 8-monate old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the "one-child" policy, in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen cleared, and the einzelkindern affectionately 'small Emperor', has produced, bevölkerungskrise in the country.
The average birth rate is to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 when it came into force, the UN
Department of population, while the number of population of 60 years of age and older in the year 2020 16.7% by the year 2050 to 31,1% rocket. This is far beyond the global average of around 20%.
This imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population, like Shanghai, more.
Last year, 60 and older almost 22% of the reported in Shanghai,, while the birth rate among a child per couple is important.
Lingli Xie, head of the Shanghai stadtbevölkerungs- and familienplanungskomission said that couples normal reproductive age to babies' in order to help the relationship of the ageing population, to reduce the labour shortage and to alleviate the future '.
Shanghai will soon be "old -- but not so rich -- as the developed countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual recovery
In the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy will probably be the most controversial provide that the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples, against this policy, must reckon with enormous fines, until its triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in their work.
Chinese staatsvertreter have attributed to this policy, the critical exploitation of natural landesressourcen, while human rights abuses in the implementation of policy have condemned.
In rural areas, some officials pregnant women, which are already a child were forced to abzutreiben.
Many couples have had geschlechtsselektive abortion, which, of course, a high proportion of men to women.
In recent years, government officials for people gradually weakened its stance on the "one-child" policy.
In 2004, more exceptions allowed the rule -- including urban, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been einzelkinder -- and 2007 was the tone of many hard slogans watered down.
Qiao xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for bevölkerungsforschung Beijing University said that officials recently even more radical changes, for example, couples to allow two children, where a partner einzelkind.
Shanghai in July on the first Chinese city, the aggressive campaign to promote more births has launched.
Posters, the families belehrten, only to have a child, almost overnight of directives which describe in detail, who for a second child, and how we can ask for approval.
The Council has urban employees and voluntary for family planning sent to couples go home and sheets under the doors durchzuschieben.
You also asked about psychological and financial advice for the available, the more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said familienplanungsvertreter.
Disappointing response
Although officials from a rural town in the außenbereichen of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications of couples to recognise is that after the start of the campaign to a second child, the urban districts against this report.
In the Community huinan with a population of 115 000 than example still per month, only four or five requests.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city, despite the campaign still around 165.000 -- will be slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng juying, head of the familienplanungskomitees the Shanghai Community caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
You want to give your first the best.
Jiawei Yang, 27, and his wife, Liu juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and legally permit.
But they have, as many Chinese, only a minor sickness insurance and the government.
Without a social safety net, they say, that decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West assess the one-child policy as the human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineers, whose women in the seventh month with their first child pregnant.
Indeed, it is robbing us the possibility of more than to have a child.
The problem, however, is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples be psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the personalleiterin, said that they would only a child, because it was a einzelkind. "we were at the centre of the family and used that each of us.
We are not accustomed us to care for others and do not really '.
Chen zijian, a 42-jähriger, a übersetzungsunternehmen heard said it plain.
For parents from the doppelkarriere SMEs, with the birth rate is falling, he said, is about to be successful and we must be selfish.
Today the age of 20 to 39-jährigen grew up their parents during the early days of the Chinese kapitalismusexperiments fight to see and they do not want a life for themselves, he said.
A single child, he said, is huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother, their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the raumfrage -- "we must modify his home" -- and the life -- "if the child 9 months old, is already a biography of the best before giving schools."
Most of his friends are ready, this time, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first, the higher living standards, he said.
We do not want too many sacrifices.
Uno-gruppe sketches plan to reduce emissions
Promoted by the UN conference on climate change, which up to now by wild Poznań and mutual accusations was -- on Friday with the publication of a document, once again, a priority for the next 40 years an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, and the industrial nations in the near future the greatest burden shoulders.
The text, which is the basis for a final political agreement to regulate the greenhouse gases could provide both the remaining obstacles to, as well as the way forward.
But it was an important step forward in a negotiation, of the time, because next week, more than 100 leaders from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text of a specially created UN working group has been silent on the money supply, the rich countries to poor countries, so that this should be the short- and long-term global warming.
It also provides a range of options for the key issues, including as industrial and major emerging countries reduce their carbon leakage and how high the upper limit of global warming, the political decision-makers.
The process will be a great flexibility, as John coequyt, leading representatives of the Sierra clubs in Washington.
Michael Zammit cu Tajar, of the six pages of document, has drafted a 180 pages long verhandlungstext, so the focus on what the leading klimaschutzvertreter the UN, de Boer, as "the big picture.
It shows the footprint of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 2020 by 25% to 45%, compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries to reduce their emissions in the same period by 15 to 30% would reduce.
Together countries could emissions by 2050 50 to 95%.
The European Community has the talks on Friday a boost by your assurance that over the next three years 3.6 billion dollars per year in order to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change, the champions of floods and drought and avoiding deforestation.
The Friday, yet the same verbal fireworks, the discussions in the last week had intended.
The American klimasonderbeauftragte Todd Stern wordings, has rejected the binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging countries, for, if not the industrialized nations.
This train has announced that the Obama administrations a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration not more than two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement without major emerging economies to stand up and take action so star also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions by outsiders could be confirmed.
Stern issued an opinion an hour after the declaration of the Chinese vizeaußenministers he yafei, which stated that the leading American klimaunterhändler either to 'of common sense into' or 'highly irresponsible' of him was that he said at the beginning of the week, that the United States would not help China to global warming.
The future economic direction of the major world powers that are at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialised and emerging countries fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, and to save the planet, with China and the United States because of their commitments to fight amongst poorer countries, while claiming that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ulate Ricardo, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are who the costs for braking greenhouse gas emissions should bear, since even the affected countries, aggressive it, the countries with very high treibhausgasabgabe for what they did.
This is clearly a game, producing a new economic domination will develop, so ulate, also as a regional klimawandelberater for conservation internationally in Mexico and Central America is operating.
Some of the countries that the effects of climate change are most exposed to, said that they continue to be a legally binding treaty would fight in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the discussions in the best case to a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on early Friday 24 page presented a draft Treaty.
Artur runge-metzger, of the international negotiations on climate change for the European Commission, has said that the offensive of the small island States' political pressure on the whole political process, 'partly because they now are united and measures of the emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency than the delegates to the fact that most open questions before the arrival of the government leaders must be clarified, in order to reach an agreement.
High Representative, as the Indian Minister for the environment jairam ramesh and the Chinese vizeminister entstiegen their aircraft and least through the corridors of bella-centers to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, claims "courts posts, which during the next week.
The sheer scale of the Assembly, 13 000 people every day in the kongresszentrum go and, gitarrespielende activists organise night shows, in which they make a joke about the countries that they feel betrayed and sell, and draft Treaty instead of hands already passed by e-mail, represents a challenge.
The intensity are just: almost all important ministers are now and Wednesday 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We now come to whether he League, said Mr Manuel Rodríguez, Vice-President for global policy of organisation conservation internationally.

Britain's first 225 km / h faster train defines the montagsgefühl new
Monday tomorrow at 5 p.m. 13 a pipe darkness through a zugabfahrt announce that a revolution in transport in the United Kingdom.
The first hochgeschwindigkeitspendlerzug in the country, with its blitzfahrt of ashfort, Kent, London St pancras 225 km / h and 93 km in 38 minutes to go.
To Lord adonis, the transport ministers, will then lady Kelly Holmes on board the first javelin-pendlerservices from London.
He hopes that the new service Britain finally to an international rail network faster, more reliable and to link the or the midland region, the North and in London in Scotland.
The neglected province could living pendlerstädten arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would be radically reduced and the change of aircraft and car rail would the national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main parties in this vision.
But the many billions of British pound, which for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planungsschlacht and fears about could damage in the British hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen still applying the brakes.
High speed two (hs2), founded in January that the government should present a viability study, Lord adonis according to the times the report on 30 December.
This gives a detailed streckenkarte the next planned stage of the hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetzes.
The new railway line, the London with the West Midlands will combine with a margin of five metres in urban areas and places over where the effects on the environment are controversial.
In the free site, the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
Hs2 should also three options for a larger, northwards leading high-speed rail network.
Lord adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a y-förmige route, in which a single high-speed link in the West Midlands.
It would in or near Birmingham parts and a abzweig would Western pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of North-East in Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems the most effective option," said a eisenbahn-insider.
After the completion would the journey between London and Edinburgh to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened in 2025, it would allow the travellers, the route london-birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with something today about an hour.
The proposals would offer the trains with a speed of 400 km / h, thereby the British rail network would be the quickest way of Europe.
The first line was planned for 400 metres long trains with a maximalkapazität of 1 000 people point.
Up to 18 trains could per hour on the route london-birmingham in operation.
This in turn would mean that in London a terminus station would be necessary, on the 20 000 passengers per hour could be dealt with.
In view of the space limitations in the capital, are expected to survive the station would be extended to the high-speed network.
Bahnexperten that only St pancras international or euston this potential.
Lord adonis will know whether this plan, in his opinion, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision after the parliamentary elections will be taken.
But even if the wheels in motion, the rail network in sections must be built.
Trains should first by the high-speed lines on existing railway lines in the north of Birmingham, which the journey between London and Scotland in about three hours would be.
This is a major sticking point, so that a change from air to rail can be ensured, a beacon for the schienenrevolution.

It benefits to scandalous and fraudulent manner, by the lack of depositing of akronyms UDF, about this for themselves.

The Court of Justice has decided Nanterre on Friday, the artists françois-marie banier to assess whether, as the daughter of milliardärin liliane bettencourt claims, a weak moment of 80 years has exploited in a part of their assets being cheated.

This means that there is a process in this dealings, the saga of the richest families of France is worthy of mother and daughter shreds and at the same time the reins of the kosmetikimperiums l oréal.
Equally, however, ordered the 15 criminal division a medical examination in the 87-jährigen liliane bettencourt jointly by three doctors.
He and hauptaktionärin of L oréal has so far refused to such an investigation, particularly in the course of the investigation of the public prosecutor of Nanterre's conditions.
On Friday appointed to doctors before 10 March 2010 present a report in which you clearly know whether, and to what liliane bettencourt times are in a state of weakness,.
I think you will these investigations.
I will speak with it, the lawyer by Mrs bettencourt, Georges kiejman, after the negotiations.
What the lawyer by Mrs bettencourt-meyers, Olivier metzner, he is with the decision of the Court.
This is excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (banier) these old lady manipulated, which must be protected, he gave.

No one has the right to act on their behalf ', the representative of the public prosecutor's office, marie-christine daubigney.
The Court has now decided that a verdict, after the process on the admissibility of Mme bettencourt-meyers.
Manager-revolution or the end of the strategic frühaufklärung?
If nothing will change in the leadership of the great French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence in vain...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of major companies in relation to his staff, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumer from the marketing-revolution: it is for the staff to "values" is the best, as it used to be on the consumer-produkte shaped by the technicians in work.
The customers in the centre of the company has the marketing-revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets on the ground allow... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers again to impose regularly.
The demobilisation of staff can lead to a lethal demoralisation.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, particularly the employees affected.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R & eund, even more importantly, to those of the economic intelligence.
In fact, calls for the state (intelligence ducts domination que = economic intelligence) 'of all the parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision'; it is a commitment by the staff, the instructions of the authoritarian management completely contradictory.
We therefore call for a revolution, which would in denmittelpunkt, the staff of the concerns of the company equal to the customer.
The very conditional use internal opinion polls
Are the internal surveys, as the questionnaire, the Orange his wage-earners, has made this revolution in relation to the management-praxis suggest?
I am afraid, unfortunately not.
- firstly, because I have noticed that the entire structure with a new situation after many for finally it, primarily to do... as it has always done.
Also because the authoritarianism - one of the pathology of power in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most of those in a much simpler idea of human behaviour.
Emerged from the large ingenieurschulen is your interpretation of the psychology mechanistic.
They play in intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently by the United States' neuroscience 'reactivated and unwittingly far-reaching of research institutes and the media.
Thus, it suggests that it is possible, the "lever" (sic) on the involvement of employees, to engage in a aktuellein Le figaro.fr appeared to question the leaders of those in a position to a mechanistic control system for today's world is inappropriate.
The mobilisierungsfaktoren identify and measuring
Instead, one for the proper functioning of the modern companies need occupational revolution, the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is, in any consideration or practice of managing a fundamental minutes to integrate: for the workers is the commitment to the companies will only be possible if it clearly as a means to a part of their dreams, its ambition and their projects.
At the moment only take the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this idea of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that their businesses on the basis of a set doxa assess their perceived picture of the company, which allows them to achieve life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these mobilisierungsfaktoren can the managers of companies' social performance "control, forecasts and pre-empt and human resource management to the right place.
So they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence is favourable.
The speech of Oslo: the "just war," Obama praise of law a
The American rights on Friday the of Barack Obama on the eve of Oslo speech welcomes and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States has defended.
The Conservatives, the allocation of the price of Obama had held on 9 October, applauded this time the speech of the President, the example of the former vizepräsidentschafts-kandidatin in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin is the face of the right wing, the Republican Party in the United States today and added that they themselves the theme of a "sometimes necessary" war in ihrensoeben published memoir, have raised.
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, it says.
Obama, the two wars of his predecessors, George W. Bush has inherited the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo, the use of violence to justify; a way his entscheidungvon nine days ago, 30 000 to explain to send more troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the präsdent have in Oslo 'very good work'.
I found that the speech really was very good frohlockte, the former President of the House of Representatives, especially the reference to 'the existence of evil in the world', in the words of Obama's recognised.
In some parts habeich this speech and perceived as historic ginrich stated in the radio programme 'the takeaway' has been consulted.
The existing Members by some as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination presidential 2012, said that he was pleased a 'President of the left "to the members of the Nobel Committee remind us that they were not free and a price for peace not eliminate could, if the use of force would not exist'.
To Michael gerson, former scribe of George W. Bush and editor of the Washington Post, Obama has' a very American speech '.
In addition to that, that it 'who', 'he always power', 'as an American President said, "when he pointed out that the Europeans' as a sicherheitsblase life, they do not themselves have created for their protection and not a lot," gerson.
In the few, not persuaded rights, the former's John Bolton, a hawk the Bush era, the speech on the website of the national review online as "boring, unfocused and inspirationslos'.
On the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kuc in I concerned as Barack Obama resorting to the armed forces.
The war packaged under the guise of justice, can this massacre of the innocents simply justify, he warns.
The press the moderate left, however, remains praise on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believe that it is premature to Obama, the Nobel Prize was awarded, referred to the speech itself for a speaker as him for his talent is known as "monumental book '.
The speech in Oslo 'provides a ablaufplan on the management of international decisions against the conflict, poverty and oppression, "the California's newspaper.
The New York Times is of the opinion that Obama "the necessary discourse proclaimed 'and' his speech as" bleak and exemplary also '.
Drivers: three marathon for an agreement which guarantees the supply to Christmas
After a three-week marathon negotiations, the trade unions in the straßenverbandes and the tlf - the only employers ’ organisation, which until the end, on Friday evening to an agreement that the streikbefehl and the threat of severe versorgungsengpass puts an end to Christmas.

The conflict 'would do very much harm' and 'it was to be feared that the holidays at the end of the year would affect Bussereau, ".
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
The hours rate for workers with the lowest wages, is rising from 8,72 euro on 9,06 euro.
"that is not very much, but we are only small," as Pat rice Clos (lot).
The activists are now the supply depots, not more.
"It is likely to be some recalcitrant surrounding the agreement are not satisfied," he added.
The tlf-vorsitzende Philippe grillot spoke about 'a good agreement', although it was difficult, these increases in the face of international competition for '.
According to him, is the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and 100 to EUR 120 for high wages.
This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the workers' maxim Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry douine (cftc) of "an historic agreement '.
Mr jaubert (CGT) spoke on this' an acceptable compromise '.
The agreement also provides for the increase of travel expenses by 3% and the objectives of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will enable it, in particular, the issue of 13 monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr Bussereau reminded us that 'the sinking of the charges for employers of EUR 100 million in' subject to an amendment of the government bill corrected finances for 2009 was that on Thursday night by the National Assembly has been adopted.
The government is' an identical 'vote by the Senate.
The signature of the tlf allows that the agreement on the first of this organisation to businesses, and then in the case of an extension of the Ministers for the entire profession.
This will, in a very short time ', Bussereau assured.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The association fntr has denounced a "fraudulent trade 'because the EUR 100 million were the sector to offset part of the carbon tax has already promised".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate, as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but the gans-esser in the middle of the weihnachtstagen not disgruntling, laments the unostra.
For the association otre threatens the agreement 'the small and medium-sized companies in the sector over the next 12 months to dig a great grave'.

New silicon-valley
For many years it was considered secret city for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one in ten districts of capital in the Soviet Union, Moscow was a closely guarded he location for secret defence research.
Today, the Community with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from Moscow centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley '.
Significant research and production for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives selenograds contacts to Frankfurt wissenschaftsstandort riedberg attached - with the uniinstituten and the firms of Frankfurt innovation centre (fiz).
There have been a number of mutual visits and on Wednesday now and riedberg in Frankfurt selenograd signed a protocol on closer cooperation '.
The Moscow vize-bürgermeister Yuri rosljak and prefect Anatoly Smirnov of selenograd led the Russian delegation that in Frankfurt, planungsdezernent Edwin black.
2010 there will be representatives of the fiz and small and medium-sized enterprises in the scientific foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after selenograd travel.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
Companies of the fiz will allow it to respond to the growing Russian market penetration.
Russian wissenschaftsfirmen want to acquire contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
For example, these include the Moscow Institute for elektronentechnik, large companies sitronics and rosssijskaja elektronika.

Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For advocates of the project is purely and simply 'the new heart of Europe'.
Right. S21 is much more than that tieferlegen a station, more than a gigantic projects, the city of colleague from Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade in unmitigated baustellenchaos will.
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980's.
Kopfbahnhöfe with tracks, right in the middle of the city, were at that time as transport technical fossils of the nineteenth century, the bremsklötze appeared as a modern rail transport, as it was once a lot of time, locomotives in the back umzuspannen forward.
Briefly, to travel further - should's.
And that is why the kopfbahnhöfe disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a durchfahrtsbahnhof, about half-way through the trans-European schienen-magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - therefore slogan "core Europe '.
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s no longer compatible with the reality.
Even a very ambitious plan he recognised that, in the hessischen and the Bavarian city, the tieferlegen almost unaffordable.
Kopfbahnhöfe are no one and ausfahrtsproblem more, since modern wendezüge with locomotives and steuerwagen at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 beyond the ice-neubaustrecke after Ulm is being addressed.
Regional and local politicians have enforced.
The railways power with because the risks of the largest infrastruktur-einzelprojekts the Republic of taxpayers and not the staatskonzern.
Städtebaulich is the project is still reasonably justified.
There is new stadtraum, is the computergenerierten tables illustrating the planners - with much green.
For the transport system rail is s21 harmful.
The durchgangsbahnhof and the streckenausbau are intended for the transport of persons, to which one typical 1980s - huge growth.
At that time, there were no competition from low-cost carriers.
But first modern transport policy must be to strengthen the goods, because the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads.
But the neubaustrecke due to intense slope is not for freight trains.
Even more serious is that s21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
A good six billion euros are schwäbischen verbuddelt.
That is the official number.
Experts are 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
It is a fact that, in the next decade, the money to other locations and engstellen in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry.
One of the most important is the development of good 180 km route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the route in slow motion.
Urgent, right here on the tube.
But s21 than dragging its feet.
The rheintalstrecke will be the real bottleneck for international freight transport, right in the heart of Europe.
Government is considering verdict on the airport
The country's government has wiesbadener country day left open, whether they are in the judgment of the hessischen verwaltungsgerichtshofs (vgh) on night flights in revision.

Spd-fraktionschef torsten schäfer-gümbel CDU and FDP called on to their before the election promises to return to a ban on night flights, or is it as' breach '.
It is hellishly difficult if one word, said grünen-chef Tarek al-wazir alluding to the fdp-wahlslogan "We hold word '.
Minister posch indicated the accusation of schäfer-gümbel, the country's government attempts to 'rechtsverdreherei and games' but nor the night flights.
A precise legal examination need time.
The coalition was not on the basis of a 'rapid first impression'.
We need a legally secure entscheiung said, Stefan Müller (FDP).
Therefore, as the opposition, are the statements of its group never been night flights.

It was then everything more quickly than expected.
Barely two weeks after the zdf-verwaltungsrat the editor-in-chief of Santa Claus brender pushed out of the station, can a successor.
Yesterday evening the Committee on the personalie vote.
A favorite was Peter FR Blakey, head of the zdf-hauptstadtstudios in Berlin.

FR Blakey, schächters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 gremiummitglieder.
The result of the vote was in print this expenditure.
Two weeks ago schächter with his proposal, the Treaty with Nicholas brender for another five years, on the administrative board.
Only seven Members were in favour of brender, seven voted against it. Brenders from election was a heavy defeat for schächter, a erwartbare, however.
Because the unionsmehrheit on the board had already weeks before the election, brender not in office confirm.
Was the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the hessische Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under brender the news of the ZDF in audience, has refused to another term of the highly regarded chefredakteurs.
Until just before the elections there were therefore protests in which the political influence on ZDF was castigated.
Finally, 35 staatsrechtler interfered in the debate, the actions Koch's as unconstitutional an estimated.
Nothing came of it.
The person
Peter FR eyes on 4 August was born in bingen in 1957.
It was a policy, education and romanistik.

The Greens announced after the election brenders, on Wednesday, the branchenblatt medium magazine the journalists of the year was elected, a constitutional complaint.
Koch's adversary in the Board of rheinland-pfälzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said in the last week, the countries zdf-staatsvertrag should change so that personalvorschläge of intendanten not by a politically motivated majority can be blocked.
An extract from parteipolitikern from the supervisory bodies of ZDF, but also Beck.
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor Peter FR Blakey, the management board with a bold move recommended by the body immediately after the brender-abwahl sharply criticized for it.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence it both schächter without loss of face for the post of chefredakteurs nominate and the management board without the suspicion, a party office.
In the parteiarithmetik will FR Blakey already to the left.

The studiengestaltung should be more flexible, to which is the recognition of leistungsnachweisen other universities and access to master easier.
By the end of next year should courses of the country on its studierbarkeit be reviewed.
The government and the opposition had on Thursday once again the studies dispute conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The bundesvorstand the juso-hochschulgruppen called for the organisation of education policy should in future no longer be "behind closed doors' the Minister and university chancellors.
After the bildungsstreiks should now also the students and affected 'a say'.
Support for the future graduates of the President of the hochschulrektorenkonferenz (hrk), Margaret wintermantel: 'We need the experience of the students', on Thursday, you said at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with which the hrk on a common reform paper was discussed.
The trade union education and science (gew), the Bonn process as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal entitlement, of any graduates with a bachelor-abschluss access to a secondary masters course.
The other countries must ensure that for the current generation of bachelor-studierenden tomorrow masterstudienplätze enough with the best possible studies conditions available as gew-vorstandsmitglied Andreas cellar.
The countries must be much more teachers.
Freer access to master the culture ministers were not.
More than a footnote to herta Müller
More in Germany and is almost no control... 'is the anfangszeile a poem of lyrikers Werner söllner where this troubling sprachfetzen the ankunftserfahrung of dissidents, of freedom, but also its language area.
The 1951 in Romanian banat Werner was born söllner first as - speaking German and englischlehrer in Bucharest and later as lektor worked in a kinderbuchverlag in 1982, before he moves to Frankfurt.
Söllner is with various literaturpreisen has been excellent, in 1993, the legendary Frankfurt poetikvorlesungen in the goethe-universität, and since 2002, it has, head of the hessischen literaturforums in mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For considerable außerliterarisches to see, it last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, the "German literature in Romania in the mirror and zerrspiegel their securitateakten '.
Clearly confused and move söllner read out a statement, in which he rumäniendeutschen schriftstellerkollegen, including Mr Wagner, William totok, Franz hodjak and Helmuth frauendorfer, his work as the for the Romanian Intelligence Securitate a while.
Together with some of those present had söllner 1989 the German sprachpreis.
The anwerbungsversuche would gradually begun, first in 1971.
I am, söllner, "anyone against attempts to intimidate the Securitate not enough."
The poet Werner söllner is Walter.
Almost at the same time, with the nobelpreisehrung for herta Müller and unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literaturszene and, in particular, the Community of from Romania's German authors by a case that the reasons and the cowardice of a political system, which is adapted to monitoring and spying is based.
Mr söllner is, so far, bisherigem knowledge can say, not only perpetrators and victims.
In its securitate-akte have played a part in the Walter said after the confession söllners the literaturwissenschaftler Michael Markel for him and referred to the positive influence of the Walter.
He received it in all for him sensitive points' herausgehauen Markel, ".
It is a moral necessity, and this remark to make.
Söllners declaration was in the form and in the audience unexpected, surprise is the commitment of a former dissident and its cooperation with the Romanian Intelligence, however.
Germany is a cosy preserve for securitate-spitzel had already been herta Müller in July at the time, having their own acts, 914 sides, reading.
The people concerned, we should be suspect, speculation and in some cases also have known what klarname behind the aliases sorin, voicu and also verbarg Walter.
Unlike the belated now very verfahrenssicheren sighting of stasi-akten, dealing with the legacy of securitate-überwachung still very vague.
A systematic information is thwarted in recent years and has been hampered.
One of the birthler-behörde equivalent National Council for processing the securitate-akten (cnsas) was only set up in 1999, the launch of files since then, however, was more slowly.
Only since 2005, there is a law that the administration of the files.
The influence of former securitate-mitglieder in Romania is still very great, came after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for herta Müller an interview in which a previous securitate-chef from temesvar dismissive about the prize.
They have a fear, finally, it is even interrogated.
The scandal of power said this in the shape of the freedom of expression.
Certainly in the case söllner link, as so often in connection with more debt, unavoidable questions.
Why only now? who was damaged? the calm reaction of listening to söllners commitment suggests that the continuation of this chapter rather urge for knowledge and be determined by apportioning blame and shame.
To genese of herta Müller, who yesterday has received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League
It felt that as an ad RETT gekleideter außendienstler of a very pleasant holiday a sports companies goodies had distributed, as the new vfb-trainer Christian gross in monitoring of Orange plastic bag of ausrüsters a quarter past midnight in a herbeigerufene c-klasse ¨.
The man with the striking each, for its still foreign city uff chain.

Then it is in Mainz the königsklassen-leistung in liga-alltag again.
And the very once again revealed weaknesses in the rapid three gates by marica (5), träsch (8) and pogrebnyak (11).

The eighth final the Champions League (hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / arranging re-matches 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) on 18 December in nyon are chosen by lots as scrutineers.
The joy of the brilliant, a state of babbel-nachfolgers remained so behaviour.
Not only the supposed saviours of the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, dedication and spielfreude gives.
I have received the players and have said that it is to their strengths, and have encouraged, courageous, said seelenklempner gross so simply sounding formula under psychotherapist specializing babbel but no longer had any effect.
It has a kind of magic, was babbel-befürworter Jens Lehman N, 'If in football a new impetus, sometimes things happen, we would not have thought possible.'
And, Mr khedira, after weeks of verletzungspause thanks to its dynamism straight to the best players on the place, has sought the 'phenomenon "with the proverbial" fresh wind' and the functioning of the new superiors: "He is a man who and discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation.
Under babbel it had apparently been lacking.
The vfb Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns sportvorstand Horst heldt
The vfb Stuttgart needs but, above all, consistent.
Not as great as players and managers, the victory against a ersatzgeschwächte and completely on the Romanian guests to exaggerate.
They have also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen 0: 4 in the wake khedira, has come to mind.
And sportvorstand Horst heldt warned that a saisonziel have been achieved, the other is still far off.
We are not yet out of the woods.

There are decisions which other meetings and not the Jens, heldt countered the harsh criticism lehmanns.
The leadership of the Board had shown weakness and trainerwechsel to pressure pubertierender fans have decided.
That also be free day after play had been withdrawn, advantage of Lehman, as a sign of lack of sovereignty and there.
Lehmanns statements are "of narrow-minded egotism", keilte heldt and announced consequences for the schlussmann.
They are no friends for life, the two forty.
After all, but they were with all other agree that, without the preparatory work by the abgelöste trainerteam the games and combative strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants' a large proportion of the success', said heldt and Lehman, all - and also the man with the plastic bag agreed.
The emphasis wm-fight
Hitziges bated breath in Berne: continually provoked challengers Kevin Johnson champions vital I klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds of Ukrainians defended its schwergewichts-titel after version of the wbc.
The judgment of the judges, unanimously.

The eleven centimetres smaller Johnson, before the end of the klitschko-ära bated breath, either but always the blows of the OECD, so that klitschko his dangerous rights not crucial objective.
In fact the passive Johnson too little for a challenger and sought only on the round.
Although he provoked klitschko with words and gestures, its blows met the champions, but rarely.
He is, after all, only the second Boxer after Timo Hoff man in the year 2000, with klitschko on the full period of twelve rounds.

Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin, Defense Minister guttenberg because of the incorrect information on kunduz-affäre as a liar.
The SPD and left calling for clarification of the German Chancellor.
HAMBURG / Berlin - the latest information on the bombing of kunduz, the opposition karl-theodor Defence Minister to guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The ministers have the fatal bombardment on two tanklastzüge of September 'knowingly the falsehood', said grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ard-nachrichtensendung 'television'.
It is called the generic: he lied.
The orders to kill is in contravention of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) has been given.
That is the substance of the report, the NATO had read Mr guttenberg, said comes in.
Friday was revealed that the attack not only a destruction of abducted sin, but also about two talibanführer targeted killing.
In the German kunduz-kommandeur Colonel small us-luftangriff were requested nato-untersuchungsbericht according to 142 people have been killed or injured.
Green, SPD and left demanded on Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what guttenberg really know about the event.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing part of what the German Government - and whether Chancellor, armed forces and intelligence have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and grünen-kollegin Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Mr Wilhelm had the criticism.
The Chancellor did not on specific operations in the German army in Afghanistan influence, he said.
On Saturday were also doubts as to the presentation of the Ministry of the background to the dismissal of generalinspekteur Wolfgang schneiderhan and Peter wichert.
According to the mirror, the two guttenberg properly and fully on the background to the tanklaster-anschlags informed.
Officially, it was said that they had denied the existence of the nato-berichte and the Minister sensitive details.
In the context of the two top officials said, however, that the Department of Defense even on several reports have pointed out, including a two-way document of the befehlhabenden Colonel small and a feldjägerbericht.
Wichert is now in a letter asking for clarification of the facts, the 'Frankfurter general Sunday newspaper'.
A reply, he has not received, it says.
On Saturday the ministry, not to the accusations and pointed out that it will be resolved in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, next Wednesday constituent wants.
Traumwelten
Some people see in wachem state images and hear voices other not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and the drogenrausch blurs the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as the sleep, everything is in order.
If we, with our eyes closed in our dark chambers, we must phantasiegebilden likes the wildest imagination and large.
However, those who, in the wake traumartige conditions be seen things and to listen to the other not see or hear is the modern Western world mostly as mad drogensüchtig or, at least, as a sonderling.
But such images and vote not only in mental health or the drogenrausch.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to homes, paint pictures or novels, to ensure that the borders between dream, madness and reality are becoming increasingly blurred.
Traumartig modified wachbewusstseinszustände in various forms, in the best case, we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Even if cause and effect may differ, the vision of the mystikerin hildegard of bingen, the drogenerlebnisse of new-age-propheten Carlos castaneda, schamanische entrückungszustände, psychoses and hallucinations but due to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural, the brain - especially dopamin, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholin derailment - and the interaction of different gehirnteile disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusion good ideas are very often during a schizophrenic climate.
The force more about it has no power
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle concept hallucinations as a form of dream in ensure state, Wilhelm griesinger, one of the founder of modern psychiatry 1861, a "great similarity of the irreseins with traumzuständen ', for Sigmund Freud was the dream indeed' a climate, with all the inconsistencies, wahnbildungen, false perceptions of such a".
It is autumn 2001, when Henning tonnes a comic strip figure.
His body is two dimensions and quietschbunt.
The force has no power more about it, he is hanging in the zimmerdecke.
He feels a.
Teufelsgestalten well-known behind him with blutroten, distorted fratzen, zähnefletschend.
They do it, it with serious, flames boots, let him against the walls, he feels the pain to the entire body.
Loud, malicious votes roar of walls and radio.
It is no longer the process it.
Henning T. tackles two cable from the stereo, knotet a noose and consolidating them snags.
It is rising at a loudspeakers and is tightening the noose around the neck.
.
The noose is.
This should be a lesson to you, in the vote in trommelfellzerfetzendem choir, 'you in the hospital and let you cure. "
Today, Henning T. 40 years old, he has six acute psychoses, is the last two years, the first almost 20 years.
She was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoide climate, it is also manisch-depressiv, it takes drugs, against the depression, the mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned, with his illness, for three years now, he married.
I fear the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The mere are cruel reality
Approximately one per cent of the population illness at least once in their lives with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals, such a second disease after the depression.
In an emergency schizophrenic dissenters affected can no more between internal and external world, are in a übererregten state of hallucinations, scale, relationships or paranoia.
This is particularly widespread stimmenhören - voices orders, comment on dialogisieren or.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned is important not more of an important to separate the brain can no longer disturbing signals from filters, awareness is a burning flooded.
As the dream opens the floodgates for the fear a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper bewusstseinsschichten come from.
The realitätswahrnehmung in the climate is subjektzentriert says Professor Thomas Fox, oberarzt the clinic for general psychiatry in Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic lies at the heart of life, everything has its to him.
At the same time it in a passive role, it will, as in the dream, of events overwhelmed and it cannot actively shape.
This often schizophrenic feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A realitätsabgleich is largely impossible, the mere are cruel reality, wake up.
Once in a lifetime to have seen an incredible nation
Unlike in the dream, says Fox, "is the sinnliche and geographical structure of the reality in the climate, basically."
The irrational thoughts and hallucinations liable to be based in the reality of the verfremdung of erlebens will take place in real terms.
Why exactly our brains antics proposes, researchers are still a mystery.
Ausnahmezustände in every person can lead to the reality in the short term, says Fox.
But not everyone will develop a climate.
It seems a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but zwillingsstudien have shown that the genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers are assuming that the minimal brain damage.
We suggest that the neurons ALE maturing of brain at an early stage of development will be disrupted by a virus of mother during pregnancy, for example, explained Fox.
But there remain a mystery how the disruption of the neural system, which is, furthermore, first of all manifestiere over many years.
Also environmental factors play a role, stress or traumatic experiences can trigger for fear that the operation is there.
Also incredible no genes drugs can psychoses, since in the transmittersystem intervention.
If our brains is overheating
The stupidity, psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines, in order to get rid of them, others are spending money on drugs, because in order to get the Lübeck, says he psychologieprofessor he I castes.
Whether mirage than pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of the position.
Castes collects for ten years reports on hallucinations and trugerscheinungen, last year, it results in the book 'The unreal world in our head' evaluated.
Hallucinations belong to the typical effects of psychoses, but also of surprising many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as border line or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer's disease and schädelhirntraumata.
Surprisingly hallucinates under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, castes, from gedächtnisinhalten together, which normally.
They are areas concerned with sensory processed and active or too little discouraged, if our brains is overheating or, if stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this situation as well as brain damage or fear.
But it is also reizentzug, stress, liebeskummer or other mental ausnahmezustände.
Recent studies were up to a third of those polled said, at least once in their lives to have seen an incredible nation.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, they live in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and visited the school.
A normal girls, really.
Were it not for the images and vote.
In the break it can happen that a schlaksiger young with long dark hair it addresses.
If he replied that the with pupils it surprised - no one else see or hear these young.
You believe that the timid girls for a versponnene tagträumerin Sarah K. dreams, but not, it knows it.
It is, you can see or hear these young, just as the girls in the Bank itself, and in addition.
It can even its presence felt, at least for moments.
A Nice, they may the young.
I am mad?, they sometimes.
But you know that the young and the other mere not are real and then disappear again.
The most alarming phenomena are at night
Often, the mere a burden.
If you are sitting in the classroom, it can sometimes do not follow the unterrichtsstoff because of teachers in their eyes and ears just a new with pupils, while all other visual and visible in the bar of mathematical equations explained.
The most alarming phenomena are at night.
If you in their dark room on sleep is far too little and too late, it can often do not consider whether you awake or even dreams, whether the pictures they see the fratzen or the girl with the bleeding average wounds of arms and legs, before their open or closed eyes.
Let me alone, they make.
Parents and friends told you that they would not insane.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
It has in the past year the baccalaureate and live with their friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations.
Since the Internet, to contact the psychologists castes, it knows very well that you not insane.
Now is also a work of art of Despair
If someone socially isolated or under reizentzug, he has, in all probability, after a while hallucinations, says castes.
I suspect that the brain is then underemployed, and even for the entertainment.
Sarah K., a einzelkind, as a young girls fear of other children, often played it alone.
Their hallucinations began with 13, as you heard that man you Daddy, since they can, not their leiblicher father.
Since on visual and acoustic hallucinations the same hirnbereiche active, are the real impressions and noise, it is affected as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish between fantasy and reality. 'every "castes, says,' will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, therefore, be they are so real. "
Also night dream images, caste as a form of incredible nation.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from which an acute climate.
Unlike schizophrenic are mentally its mere as unreal.
Castes advises his patients, therefore, hallucinations as special ability value.
Grenzzustand between dream and incredible nation
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten world imaginary see pathologisiert often, alas, Michael schmidt-degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and chefarzt the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy of florence-nightingale-krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A climate is a terrible, tragic disease, but it also has positive, creative - madness is also a work of art despair.
Schmidt-degenhard, the so-called oneiroide erlebnisform researched, a special form of traumartig modified wachbewusstseins.
Oneiroide are highly complex and detailed quasi-träume, the erlebende for real and it does not subsequently cannot distinguish between the security situation.
The oneiroide bewusstseinszustand arises in trauma- or illness extreme situations, for example in polyradikulitis-patienten in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a person of self- and weltverlust is under threat, for example by continuing total impotence, it replaces the life-threatening real situation by their own imagined world, the reality is decoupled schmidt-degenhard says.
A kind of grenzzustand between dream and incredible nation.
As a situation in reality is not possible, a weltwechsel instead of the real situation, but the imagination.
An intensive form of sense foundation and meaning in a precarious situation, the US people own design capacity, not in a nothing of the bewusstseinsverlustes.
Everything is real, later in the memory
The Zürcher art historian Peter Corneliu's claussen its oneiroid-erlebnisse describes in his book 'herzwechsel' as a bailout of the soul.
It is 49 years old when his awareness of herzklappenoperation, followed by the herztransplantation posted on travel, while his body in the course of the lack of movement is doomed.
Claussen, a world in a selbstgeschaffene visited foreign times and places: he is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a zugsanatoriums, a robot guard on his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, the drugs under dignitaries from blood.
It is a Greeks on motorcycle in its own country you surf abducted, with his spitalbett firnschnee in the Alps and is a Korean mafioso.
It is entirely in the imagined N, everything is real, later in memory.
This internal travel for claussen differ fundamentally from any dream.
Dream is a different situation, described it.
Quite the contrary, I remember the memories of mental there for years and in secondary details.
More determination and even really experienced it.
The intensity of the erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other lebensweltlichen experience, says the schmidt-degenhard psychiatrists.
At the end of oneiroide show, psychoses, hallucinations and drogenrausch how fragile our internal images of external reality in check.
Any change in the bewusstseinszustandes, summarise the psychologist castes, "a verformung what we reality. '
An experience which may also be enriching.
The schneeeinbruch can come
Burda
Children should take the publishing house with 27 years
The new verlagschef kallen is an intermediate solution, in the long term will be Hubert burda companies in the hands of his two children, he said the mirror.
The holding should also in future to 100% of the family.
Hamburg, the publisher Hubert burda companies in the long term, will be in the hands of children.
Both children heirs of 27 years and have the firm will to companies, said the 69-jährige the mirror.
The details as we have.
The question of whether they are active in companies, only then.
The question of whether they are able to do so.
We cannot 7 500 staff his child, if they are not enough.
This brings the children and the companies too.
On Thursday burda had announced that he is from January by the company, and paul-bernhard kallen appointed to his successor.
The 52-jährige kallen is a Member of the board in burda since 1999.
Firstly, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the area Treasury responsibility for the unternehmensvermögen and, after the departure of Jürgen todenhöfer for direct marketing and abroad, pressure and finances.
For the first time is not a family member at the head of the verlages.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix today, 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of kallen serving to 10, 15 years' bridging ', so burda.
The holding should continue to 100% of the family, burda said.
With regard to the cases schickedanz and schaeffler spoke burda that family businesses are certainly not from disaster: "that was always families are left by a kapitalsucht are quite speculated away and thought they could become a major player.
My strategy that was never.
He "never weltmachtträume ', so burda.
I am not as the political präzeptor this country as spring he was, and I do not want to in the world league with 'time', these shops are too great.
The promises of fonpeek
Äuβerst peek is limited, a device that only his e-mails can read, without the possibility of certain annexes can see or surfing the Internet.
It has its five minutes enjoyed glory than the magazine time one of the products of the year.
On the straβe to see is unlikely, but the idea is, nevertheless, especially for young people.
In contrast to the smartphones peek costs very little and has a very favourable unmetered access, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of 1 phone.
After the company that has seen the success it has two new products on the market: one, the only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong gratisservice for data, unlike the peek which a six times higher price to pay.
Fonpeek yesterday in Le web presented, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, as its American counterpart, but has a surprise.
The monthly unterhaltspreis on the telephone, about EUR 12 per month, roaming across Europe.
Those who, with a smartphone to travel the world already know what it means, on all the data to abandon its e-mails, as soon as they cross the border, or if you are desperate for a café with W IFI addiction (or a means of access with telephone).
The idea of the roaming with unmetered access is incredibly attractive and it should be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers have separate treaties and prices for abroad, but in my experience, it is already a doctorate in physics and a good glasses, in order to be able to read the small print.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe, almost always.
Auβerhalb of their own country has always afraid his e-mails to read and rightly so.
A small as fonpeek (and again it is astonishing that the name telephone, although there is no W IFI / wlan has) this type of tariffs can offer, means that the telephone providers, slowly but surely, in various ways, and must start to consider how they can use the Internet.
Kindle is another good example, in its prices is the downloaded of books and further questions on the Internet.
Without vetrag and without snags.
This is a internetfähiges equipment and pay only one single occasion, the sale, and not every month.
And that is what I expect of fonpeek one day, a kaufmöglichkeit with lifelong Internet access as the peek already in the US.
And that is not because I want to buy.
I read my e-mails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this, because I am of the opinion that a suitable model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to have a computer with the same system.
The fetischfarbe of Michelle
Yellow is without doubt the lieblingsfarbe American first lady.
The arrival of Barack Obama as President of the United States, in a dress and a mantle of the colour and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life to accompany: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has on two occasions very similar models: auβer borne almost the same colour - was a shining grüngelb - was the clothing from three parts - clothing jacket and protected from the same material- and has contributed a groβförmig gesticktes or a chain.
It even goes so far that it at first sight seemed that the first lady the United States the model of the Princess of Asturias and decided to follow the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes, but very much in the stoffart, from which they are produced.
At the inauguration them a dress from top and in Oslo and one from gemusterten.
The accessories were different: the first time Green footwear with halbhohen sections and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
The hair was different: each time the hair, on this occasion haarkranz as high in the previous bore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have because of their maternity problems in the get work
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially in the younger women who want to have children.
This is the csic in cooperation with the Institute for women study "fertility and career of women in Spain '.
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities on the labour market due to their maternity restricted.
The study is open, that there is very broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women working or not, and if so, what kind of work.
Those of you who auβerhalb of the House do no other work only part-time work or a fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast to postpone the women with a strong employment, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"women aged between 35 and 49 years with a strong employment their first child on average only 3.7 years after the together, a number of 4.1 years for women with permanent employment, to have taken longer to achieve this and it and the first child have achieved much later.
Auβerdem has also the type of work a groβen influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar of empfängnisbereitschaft, "says the csic-forscherin Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is a further factor in the age of the women in marriage and the first child must be taken into account.
According to the age at the time of the first child marriage and the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference has also from the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are only the main education or a higher education have, on average, each with 25,1 or 32,1 for the first time mother.
Furthermore, there are still, depending on their level of education, another difference between women.
While the women with hauptschlussabschluss before your first permanent employment and marry their first child, the women of a medium-sized or high school exactly the other way round and only a permanent employment and marry later and receive their first child is Delgado.

Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother was last week by our district in the village of fuenlabrada love, and a group of young people between 15 and 18 years alongside their and our dog herliefen, our dog is a mischling that we have obtained from the animal sanctuary and just six kilos, and then from the blue missed him two fußtritte and injured it so difficult.
It is not our indignation in, because we understand that since the spass in a cheap aggression against a small and defenceless animals, it is of course a has been implemented.
Added to that is the erstickungsanfall, a woman who was walking cosy, she was these people on the grounds of the incident to wanted it feared even for their own lives, because if so a mad attacked a dog, it will be the same perhaps even a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or possibly even with each of the weaker than it is.
The incident occurred in a normally calm areas at 5 p.m. on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog geheult all day long.
Of course, we have a nahgelegenen police complaint, but we have major doubts about whether that anything will bring any prejudice and from the outset, we only want to make it clear that the cowardly Spaniards were criminals.
Our indignation about the events which have led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what in the minds of these young people that they must pursue a cheap attack on a defenceless animals amused by, of an animal us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and the people.
Michelin and fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish foundation for road safety (fesvial) a campaign to promote the helmgebrauchs above all in the younger motorcyclists, as both the company.
This initiative is the importance of the helmgebrauchs out, as this is the only schutzelement at the head injury or even death in the event of a motorradunfalls can prevent.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment in relation to road safety, the "far more than just the design and manufacture of products with each day safer 'and, on that you also with other actions educational and informative nature will contribute to this objective every day to come a step closer to.
This new campaign to promote the helmgebrauchs on motorcycle, under the slogan 'to be or not to be' - is in a first phase posters at about 500 motorradwerkstätten, so as to achieve the best possible spread.

The sale of small lorries is rising again something to
After almost two years of the car market for light commercial vehicles is a light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles, in November in Spain have been allowed to mean a rise of 12.6% in relation to the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at all after 22 months running keep going with decline, gemäβ by manufacturers association anfac and the autohändlerverband ganvam presented figures.
However, these good figures are currently only with groβer caution to genieβen, since the comparison used reference data of November 2008, which is a particularly bad verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must remember that, apart from the growth in the last month, the gesamtzulassungen this 11 months still 40% below the sale of the previous financial year.
Since January, total 95.853 vehicles sold in this number, but all vehicles, which is the kleintransportermarkt: descendants of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, pick-ups, small vans and lighter vans / chassis.
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, the most affected, because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals, the groβteil of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which almost 100% of the purchase by a third-party financing.
It is on these restrictions, what the result of the zugedrehten flow of credit institutions, einschlieβen with other factors, such as the increase in the rate of unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this situation, and unlike cars, the financial aid to buy a car of the plan 2000e little to help.
This plan is, however, not only for private individuals, including the self-employed and small businesses have a right to a light commercial vehicles of up to 3.5 tonnes with a co2-ausstoss, not 160 grams per mileage exceed, wish to buy, but the low numbers speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, ganvam reminded that it is part of the State is required, a special attention in this light, and, of course, to the industriefahrzeuge (lorries and buses).
The autohändlervereinigung destined for the year 2010 a similar year as last, for a verkaufsausfall (in cars and offroad vehicles) by 19%.
The support for bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As was already the antiblockierbremssystem (and now with the electronic stability control, must the aid systems on the brakes in emergency situations equipment in the European cars.
In fact, they are already authorised for all new cars and light light commercial vehicles, for the remaining vehicles has been a karenzfrist by the end of February 2011.
The adopted by the European Union maβnahme aims to improve the protection of fuβgänger, however, these braking systems because of their operation also help many front-rear collisions.
The task of the notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical bremsmanövers system, on the basis of the bremsstärke carried out by the drivers on the brake PE pushing recognises.
However, this system is exerting this pressure until the end.
According to the komponentenhersteller for the bosch-fahrzeuge research, a third of involved in an accident driver from the toss together, not more, on the brake PE pushing and half of them had not with full force slowed down.
Up to 1 000 accidents
The bremshilfe against, with maximum force in the braking system and reducing the bremszeit and therefore also the bremsabstand, a car in the bremsvorgang back.
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1 000 fatal accidents, which fuβgänger harm to come, be prevented if all cars equipped with this type of notbremsassistenten.
It would even be fewer accidents - it is estimated that every fourth accident with people could harm - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems to be popular.
It is a vehicle equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and the drivers, and at the same time a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the drivers then, giving it the system, the pressure on the brake PE pushing, if necessary.
If the drivers, not to the warning and even if the together's toss already is unavoidable, the bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes from the damage as far as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the opel-werks in Figueruelas factory (Zaragoza) through Nick reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that the production of new me Riva in the first aprilwoche will probably start on 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturers to indicate that it needs more time to the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, will in fact ensure that the affected party to every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this very reason, it may be that the final document, the first of the workers and the governments of the countries in which it works, to postpone until the beginning of 2010.
Dementgegen by GM assured us that, in the next few days, a decision on selling Saab meeting.
So it is not surprising that the Swedish Government to put pressure on the American car manufacturer has increased, so that this as soon as possible a decision.
GM too, with some possible new buyers in touch.
One of these buyers geely could be happy to Volvo to want to buy, however, the option of Dutch producer of skyper-sportwagen by the Russian group converg backing, increased support.
If none of these buyers agreement should GM some assets to the Chinese baic sell.
The decision to schlieβen Saab at the end of the year, if it is not sold, will also continue.
At the helm of the Porsche boxster spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel engineers the boxster used as basis and really succeeded him by 80 kilos, of which he now only 1.275 kilos of the world.
So, the first thing you renunciation on the automatic aufklappbare roof, a zeltleinwanddach replaced with manuellem accord alone has saved 21 kilo; thanks to the in this model aluminiumtüren used as the gt3 'disappeared' a further 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again 13; auβerdem one has the kraftstofftank of 64 to 54 litres of reduced, so that other 7 kilos of savings; with the installation of sporting bacquet-sitzen again 12 and with the slight 19-zoll-felgen back five saved.
It was also due to the audio-system cdr-30 again six kilos of less and the exchange of türgriffe of the absence of a kilo of substance.
Although it also with the doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, the test with a car with 6-gängigen handgetriebe, mainly to the smaller landstraβen of California, in bergstrecken, which really was very kurvig.
In this way, we can give him the note irreproachable.
The reduction of its weight, but not geführtdass he is no longer so sure would be on the straβe.
Rather, the opposite is the case: since long have we no longer a small and light probegefahren model, a but also a sense of groβer security in graphs, even at high speed.
It is a small athlete,, its muscles in low motion in the necessary time to warm until we give him the orders, of course, slow to recover and then all over again from his engine to attract...
He is doing what he says. The car makes everything we him with our hands at the wheel indicate, thanks to its management, the same communications and precise.
And it is doing so with the precision of surgeons.
A motorsound taste for all
The and its v6 boxers with 320 PS (10 more than the boxster) is very successful and it cannot increase with the 'sport' -option and by means of a system that the motorgeräusche can change, which has already been used for the first time in the panamera.
The beschleunigungsvermögen is inconceivable brutally, whether from the stand out or when speed up.
The federungen are strong, but not hard or inconvenient.
The asphalt on the landstraβen on which we in the boxster spyder, was quite damaged, but the car meisterte the blow holes.
The electronic assistants had on the whole distance almost nothing to do, and that although we in some of these curves ice in the early hours of this morning and rollsplitt.
In summary, it is a ultraleichtes car, a car, which has an indescribable fahrspass, otherwise rather rare and it is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster SS.
The car in February 2010 will come on to the market and 70.831 euros.

The second quarter was little different, only that the team from what is for a innenseitiges game of barac chose and for the game of Eliyahu, on his return to the team with pfiffen and applause was received his home is to their advantage to break further develop (34-43).
Teletovic began to the best of his team with 13 points, also wennn "minus six 'assessment of cluster can already guess lieβen, that this is not the best evening of Brazilian.
Nevertheless, the game, despite the clear advantage in the break, still decided and the makkabäer vitorianer wanted to remind you once again that not everyone on the playing field, and thanks to the constantly attacking the hand of Elías "they came into play.
Eidson and pnini contributed to a crucial that the "yellow" the helm umdrehten (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanov ic, injured, but anything other than dead, a few game trains with accuracy, to come back to life and one of them was suddenly the gun of Mirza teletovic, with three almost successive triple and with the support of English and ribas ensured that, on the anzeigentafel again einberuhigender gap by (54-67) indicates that the host at the end of the third quarter with (57-67 enhance).
The alavesen were in the last quarter bloβgestellt and English and San emeterio (60-75) already announced that it would allow anyone's victory in the first dreiβig minutes honest deserved, taking back.
Nevertheless pnini resigned and eidson, not the best of their team and trying to your team by three points of the approach (70-77) force.
Nevertheless, and despite the mote because fouls has been sidelined, the team of Ivanov ic not argued well, and although the Israelis nor at the last minute aufholten (85), the game has already had a winner and Tel Aviv, for the first time in this season.

Thank you.
According to the most attractive days since last spring, in which the inflation of the assets of the prevailing mood of the markets, on the markets returned again the insecurity, which in any case is surprising, because this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on inherently uncertain future.
The stabilisation of the markets maβnahme used was the debt with the direktkauf of assets and indirectly to settle the liquidity free hand in interest rates, which is the zero so that in this way the banking assets to buy out.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direktkäufe of assets as well as ended and, without their heterodox policy to liquidity, begin to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE näc already vormachte with their jahresversteigerung, the next week.
Therefore doubt the investors in the capacity of the world economy, the economic recovery without them, let alone heterodox maβnahmen to maintain, and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The flüchtigkeiten the stock exchanges and the differences in unternehmensboni rise again, even if it is still a long way from the paranormalen amounts are at the beginning of the year.
The Member States have been forced to nationalize risks, the private and the public debt rise again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven of investors, resulting in an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro zone in regard to Germany.
Spain has been little of this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards in the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, is not a degree of uncertainty, the defenders of the moral risk to silence the once again tried, with the leaders of the world economic policy an awareness, for what you had caused to the devastating effects of the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs, as they had slowed down a new day to dankesaktion beschlieβen should have.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai, on a stammeskrieg between the emiren to power in the Emirates and restore the development in Greece has also been previously anticipated.
A government which the public debt concealed, elections and a new government, which are on the same side.
Prodi made it in Italy, Mr Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year of its external payments and therefore a euro-mitgliedsland saves his commitments, not more.
It is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and its citizens in need of auβergewöhnlicchen maβnahmen with, the stability of public money.
Yes, we are as expected an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses on to large sums, would now within the expected.
In the case of Spain, we must not worry, as long as the differences of public debt with the same speed as the European unternehmensboni increase.
Should the European differences and reduce the Spanish dannn would continue to increase, it is a special Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While domestic early indicators of a groβteil marktforschungsinstitute forcing their plans for the recovery and their scenario for 2011 upwards, einschlieβlich to correct the ocde and the European Commission, which again with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy come promises all this despite warnings a long life span.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although at the moment "caution to the 'is the order of the day.

After his appearance, the chairman of natural-fenosa gas, Rafael villaseca Galán, was followed by the press some stichpunkte on what he is the subcommittee behind versschlossenen doors made.
According to the chairman of companies, Spain must 50 billion by 2020 euround further 60 billion from that date until 2030 invest under the depend that existing nuclear power stations in operation.
Should this not be the case, then the investment needed to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Companies, however, is of the opinion that we no longer in increasing energy capacity, but should invest in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020 will change the issue and we should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and kohlewerke with entities for the capture of carbon dioxide and, above all, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case it is assumed that 18,000 MW more are needed, under the vorraussetzungnatürlich by other 'stützenergien'.
Galán, think that the gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, which was adopted by the government, in line with what his company, wanted to say something about this law, such as incentives for the national kohleverbrauch, which is the exact opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his view, "in the long term, we clearly in this direction, despite some 'individual' maβnahmen, the leader of companies.
It does Galán, that we now have the decisions on investment, even if this is long term, because it will take some time and a stable financial framework must be created for it.

Acciona competing with hochtief and Bouygues his first motorway building in Australia
Acciona fighting for the granting of his first motorway in Australia, a market where they already as energy and water companies.
The construction, it is a tunnel, the 1.7 billion Australian dollar (about 1,047 billion) will cost.
The French company Bouygues and the German hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnels in the Australian city Brisbane, on the East coast, is the best opportunity for acciona, in the countryside and construction companies and autobahnbetreiber.

Against the team of acciona the consortium Northern direct, formed from the British companies laing O'Rourke, the Australian transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructures and the French baugruppe Bouygues.
The third and final consortium in closer election is, is called lbrjv composed of the capital of the Australian leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company, which, in turn, to hochtief ACS), which is also local baulderstone (in possession of the German group bilfinger Berger) and the French companies razel in public construction specialised.
The Australian market for infrastructures promises enormous works and privatisations, but has a hurdle to be overcome, because only with the purchase of a local construction company, have access.
A strategy of these companies hochtief or bilfinger, in addition to Asian credentials, followed, and by the Spanish baugiganten yet.
Even ACS rejected this market only through their participation of 30% of hochtief, the owner of the so-called leighton, entry.
Millions of assets
Acciona in this geographical area is of the utmost importance for the industry, in which it has already given its work as an energy supplier and the entsalzungsindustrie very familiar.
