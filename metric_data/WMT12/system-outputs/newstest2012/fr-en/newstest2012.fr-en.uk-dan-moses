Parliament has not ratified the amendment to the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament refused, in the context of an amendment to the criminal law, the project cancelled the paragraph on the charge of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
The members have refused at second reading the draft amendment to reduce sentences for economic crimes, which could open the doors of freedom for the former First Minister currently in prison.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having reached an agreement in principle with Russia disadvantageous for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court should rule on the appeal of the convicted in December.
Tymosenko describes the judgment of political retribution from the regime and began a process of suspected bias of the court, also to the west.
The project to cancel paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Premère Minister was sentenced, has been signed by 147 members.
It would have required 226 votes for approval.
Libyan victory
The release or libyan rebellion has already defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him, the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, the election winners are the islamists, but are they the moderate or radicals.
The interim National Council declared the law usual Sharia law and we already know what it is.
Libya is a country without a crime because for a flight is cut.
Women can forget the emancipation, not respect any 'faith are punishable by death …
This is the Koran that will unite in place of the personality of the dictator, the company made up of tribes opposed.
In Libya, there would be such an order as we cannot represent and as we would surely not.
But our way of life is not unique, is not the best objectively and probably would not be advantageous for the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamist warriors have accepted aid with recognition of dogs infidels.
The only excuse is that this is not a general américian who led the NATO bombing but Allah they hailed the greatness to each attack.
When it comes to looking for the victors in Libya, the West was not one of them
We have participated in the shooting, served Islam and our poilitiques walked away from the dictator as a political ally without that brings no benefit.
After the recent bad experience of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily in Libya.
There is no problem for local to débarasser of “ crusaders ”.
Is it that without use of the land, oil companies have easily accés to black gold libyien.
Perhaps not as much and the West can finally boast the desintéressée protection of human rights.
If we prevent these followers of Sharia law.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.

Iranian students are prepared to die for their country 's nuclear program.
They created a human shield
Several hundred students from colleges and universities have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support this gesture by the nuclear programme of their country facing a possible israeli attack.
The students began to pray at noon at the site and then sought the death of the US and Israel.
Hundreds of students from the universities of Isfahan have created a human shield Tuesday around the centre of nuclear technology is transformed when Isfahan uranium.
As a result, they have openly expressed that they will take the programme nuclaire of their country at risk to their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its latest information that Iran has not ceased to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
It is widely reported in Israel of a possible attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon at the site and then sought the death of the US and Israel.

The feeding of an obese child: not taken breakfast and not taking the doughnuts for the dinner
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 years have problems of overweight, 9% of écoliersont weight above average and 5% are obese.
As the show the current research obese children come from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle.
It shows again how important is the environment in which is developing the human being and models that surround it.
On the tables of obese children example of the doughnuts 50% more often than in the families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese had chips on the dinner, according to the survey conducted with an awareness action “ Obésité is not a chance ”
For the families of the small big sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most pupil today - only 15% said that at least once a week, the parents found the time for the movement.
Investigation of 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and participated in 900 primary school pupils of the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of “ the Obésité is not a coincidence, ” action supported by the insurance general health and the company Unilever.
 From the beginning that is more than 12,000 students from sixth to third who have registered for this project.
One of the key factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children are overweight or obese, is the absence of a proper food and not enough exercise.
“ Seulement half the children asked indicates, for example, eat 5 times per day breakfast - if - lunch - taste - dinner, which is a basic principles of good food, ” says one of the results of the investigation.
Without breakfast and dinner at doughnuts
Experts point out that a healthy development must be a few basic details such as a breakfast with family at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of families of pupils eat at the same time my.
In the majority of families each takes his breakfast alone.
And the worst that has been raised is only a tenth of the population does not at all for breakfast.
Breakfast is still the basis for a good diet daily.
The questionnaire showed that obese children in families are consuming more often chips on unhealthy.
Almost every pupil - not to mention the weight - drink every day of sweet drinks (70%).
More than 40% of children questioned made sport regularly but for the parents of the half, only 15%.
You prepare your diet
Another part of the investigation has allowed children chosen (204 boys and girls of 172 13 schools) to prepare its own food from possibilities presented according to their taste and their own personal opinion.
“ The preferences of the czech children of 12 to 15 years are far, in terms of healthy eating, the ideal. ”
Among their favourite meals there are many cakes, meat and sweets.
“ The more alarming is particularly great preference for lemonades sweet ”, indicated in the results of the investigation.
For lunch, the pasta, which took place just before the first white meat.
Children do not want starches and preference for fish and cooking vegetables was very low.
Course on health
The investigation has also shown that children are prepared to change their habits when they receive the information ad hoc.
“ During an inspection of a group of participants in the study had fulfilled the questionnaire after sitting awareness “ obesity is not a coincidence, ” has been assité a definite desire to move towards a healthy diet, ” says the results of the investigation.
Most striking has been for example in lemonades sweet because children have begun to give preference to water consumption.
Children are more often ticked off the questionnaire white meat and fish as a main course and reduce the sweet dishes and “ knedliky ” (spécialté Czech agree meal bread or potatoes).
The designer must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation on the way to learn for the stylistes, I put a little angry about the fact that there were many from the start.
I did not think that was going to happen afterwards.
The exposed three professionals, specialty clothing characters and a seminar on what is happening on the ground.
And this will be worse.
As we approach the final exams and we expect more practical exercises and information.
And even when there are of course Saturday and Sunday is truly “ stuffed ”.
This time we have with the head Alenka (over there is no boy) Treaty of how to dress the woman who has no statistics standards.
And women of this type is the majority.
One has a small necks, the other a body of boy, without special curve, another of the overweight.
The designer must know how extend ammenuiser arms wide, prolonging a neck or add graphs necessary.
We have arrived and nicely to highlight the character and also not to dress that way too obvious types of women as Jennifer Lopez with strong breasts and hanches said, and a fine size.
If there is such a difference between the size and the hanches in such a way that skirts or trousers are not at all, it is worth to turn on the measure.
And do you regret not because clothing comes neatly is invaluable.
In a skirt tailor you feel much better than in the slip permanently, enroule and lies not with the belt and so on.
For those who have the appearance of a male who can afford a clothing style Tucker, with bits of tissues flimsy, or even the embroidery.
Of course there are many examples of “ various appearances and I am pleased that I have a whole week to compartmentalize all information received.
But I also fear that in what I have to do to the house there too.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of fashion personality and his appearance.
I will have to “ dress ” Miranda Kerr, that maybe you are aware of the campaign the Secret of Victoria.
At the back of my mind, I am pleased, because it is better than to dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, which has taken almost 100 kilos lately (do not take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We must cut and sew from magazines or seek on the Internet, print and work the graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say in the final outcome, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with the creation graphics.
Also reflect on the part of the graph styling is also important.
The designer did not dress and only the physical but creates for example the pages productive in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc …).
Mario Kamenik, designer and graphiste, we had all this.
But this … until Sunday
The designer must have an overview
Three guests of the specialty gave a diversified aspect to the session Saturday full of information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, designer, Jakub Polanka graphiste of fashion and Ben Renc, photographer of fashion.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know how to use it.
And a designer talent knows work with a single clothing in a different way.
The variability is essential for this example.
Such as this trench coat – which must be worn in a classic with a jeans and a T - shirt as a coat slight but it can also pay the naked body, with escarpins and the photo taken as a dress.
Or is it enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and immediately have a new look.
“ Playing with it, ” he said.
But I especially liked the following advice: “ for the work you need to know what the rules are perfectly. ”
“ You can then begin to do harm, ” said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, what, why, when in the fashion magazines are sometimes something else.
No statement on the colorful fashions.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer should have much more variants clothing than those photographiées.
This is to say that for fashion story that has a dozen pages (a dozen models) I have to be ready for “ retailler ” at least a fortnight.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality.
We must reckon with it during a creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style are sometimes half the succés has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna is not a super singer but his image and marketing into a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylistes remains cautious.
And the faces the sometimes regarded as unnecessary (it enough that I know something, but what I parais happening in the second row).
And if someone is making a styling from us, then we have to rely on the fact that it teaches us with a high likelihood a completely different size (smaller) than it has in reality.
It is then that browsing google and if so to Boulevard of celebrity in question, if she maigri or unfazed etc …
Honza Mario and we have asked the heart on Sunday that “ it is not enough for the designer 's move in the mode and assemble models.
He must communicate with people he dresses and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Guess which people, not to pander, keep his opinion.
“ When a manager you ask him compartmentalize his bed and meet new elements you cannot just throw and tell him, my God horror. ”
“ You find some business that you find him cute and that you will be discussing with what the bear, ” said Mario.
It has shown through what must contain what they call the “ placovka ” or bag of the designer.
This is the one you fasten around their waists and that you are on course for all you need.
In addition to the things clearly defined as the scissors, rolls for dépilation or even the pins to nurturer, there are also the thread of nylon (that the designer uses snapshot of products such as bags, or hats) clips special with firm a garment in the back, whether it is too big (the pin or other type of agrafe are not utlisables because they could damage the clothing) or a kit of styling.
For that we soyions not only of people listening but who tried something practical way they have taught us how to properly ressemeller shoes.
And during the photo workshop where the surface is equal, the semelle could ruin, in particular lextérieur.
And so we have stuck and paste.
We did not have the right to receive the scissors not to hurt themselves inadvertently.
It therefore really need skills.
Mario was good when he was congratulated for my creation.
The comptence that I referred to is not for my copine.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of course
I begin to understanding that make the styling a profession is not a walk in a garden roses, everyone would say what he wants.
The need to speed the run disputes across America.
Review
Originally a race without problem turns because of a series of mistakes stupid people who have nothing to do with a shifting matinal routine at work.
It fills up to a certain extent the ambition of everyone, but it achieves nothing if nobody wants to do something more.
The new part sub - titled format The Run has produced great expectations before his exit.
He promised to take a new direction with the series of race Need for Speed already old and out of a kind of game from parties jouables which will include not only with the points.
We were curious how will be added to the passages in which the hero main fate of his car and does what he wants.
As already happens in the series NFS, the result is completely different than what we atttendait.
This is potentially games of race of arcades but all pushing down because of a few mistakes unnecessary that already exist for several years.
They are not really mistakes but rather an expression of an incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are in the adventure hero whose main Jack has problems with mental disorders and resolved to participate in races illegal across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast to San Francisco and your mission is to get the first in New York.
The idea has some interesting points.
The route is divided into 10 stages and then in more than 50 racing.
Which means that every race is on a different route and stages in different environments that are far from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the sense that the game he proposes something similar.
Some environments are also quite cute even if the technical level graph is similar to the previous series.
Finally, this is not the end of the world.
But the driving through the desert, in the landscape of autumn or highly covered in snow in the mountains is very pleasant would.
The tests are more from time to time with a élement atypical.
For example, in the desert, you find yourself in a storm of sand that you significantly reduced visibility.
Then in the mountains, you must pay attention to what an avalanche will not fall over.
However the different races are well put together one behind the other.
There are only a small number but that is enough.
There are moments you strive to exceed the number asked adversaries (as in a classic) then you will race against the clock (classic duel with the machine) and you can still expects another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you have also the police who enters the game and trying to make the situation dificile.
The novelty passages are outside the vehicle.
It is rather una animation interactive when most of the time Jack flees to someone and you should help keying in on the right buttons at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there is less moments of this type that what you expect to be concrete (there are only three).
The result is good because this is not likely to hamper and, in the context described above, in which agrémentent the game.
The pattern of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but you cannot say that this is negative.
As regards the simulation realistic you must look elsewhere.
But while one can find the best in conccurrence model of conduct goes very well with the type of design of racing.
So everything is ok.
The problems began to emerge after a certain time.
Has the diffférence model of conduct, the collisions is not yet at the point.
We do not expect this game Misrepresentation complicated and collisions, but when you have not, in a collision with any subject, any idea how is your self, so this is not completely right.
During the overruns tight you touch each other sometimes slightly but otherwise your auto part in voltiges mad.
Or is in tatters.
Thanks to the system of recovery that is not really a problem but it you really upsets.
The recovery is so that when you phut or you are out in the stage the game you back to the time of the final point on the route.
But you have only 5 redémarrages.
When you have used the 5 redémarrages you need to start the game from the beginning.
So it is more a tool, if something is not done properly, that an on which you can really count.
Sometimes the redémarrages do not help and we must find a solution by remémorrant memory of the little piece of scenery in question.
The major fault of this game is that the same actions are in the same places.
For example, there are some turns to go to a certain way or it will not.
Otherwise you meet on a given place vehicles “ civilian ” still in the same configuration that you have come first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute behind.
What angers the situations when you see the opponent move easily between two cars oncoming and when you arrive, you, you must be set aside and the conturner or back.
This is equal if you go in front of him because it is “ calculated ” in such a way that the situation is still very close to your nose.
Opponents have other benefits.
For all the time in the game, you, you arrive in some places, again regardless of the time, and you always have the same opponent who you up in the same place.
It annoys more at the end of the game when you drive on a long bridge in opposite directions.
The antagonist absolutely must pass before you.
When it passes by you hide the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you walk in a collision many times.
We can understand that the goal of the game is to make something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you ennuyez quickly.
And that is a shame, because through a simple model to conduct the game is interesting and the places with both action that you do not have the time to follow what is happening.
And that is equal if it is because of the concept of 50 routes unique, that the order of racing is such that there is no chance of boring or something else.
The original idea was to change the car during races.
You must pay attention to the petrol pumps on the routes because you can change cars, however, most of the time that you enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, gas - guzzlers american highways Right and the super sports cars to exotic clothes on the pipelines very technical, for example, on the roads in lacet in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, which are of particular races in places that you are aware of the adventure, goes very well with the regime 's main story.
You get not only medals but also points to experience to add to your profile that is common to the challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, various objects are starting to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog which among other compare your results with those of other players and you provide other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway (it is) where you drive in the dark on the paths (like that).
Your speedometer indicates you between 150 and 200 km / h (in theory) and behind you is a rowing metro that sends you the car directly to the scrapheap.
Has the drafting we had a discussion for a few days to know if someone has actually thought in the creation of this game or whether the authors we really take for fools.
The technical part of the game is not outside, but the part visual is generally pleasant and in some cases really super.
What bothers is that in these situations, more extreme imagery is not the level and in some cases tragically.
This is true of accidents with a large number of participants when an imaging fluid do you use any more.
The noise is good and the runway is the choice.
With the aim of pleasing the more and more particularly the young audience a new runway noise was created in the style of “ I mix everything ”, but we can expect that people will buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: the run is really confused.
If the game had not these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that he is the best production NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The fun is really well but prepare you for what the mistakes you type in the eye with the force of a réflecteur of airport.

Vicenova Ambassadrice, near the Union européeenne:
The Czechs are behaving like négativistes and the eurosceptics
“ The Lisbon Treaty completely removed the balance between the institutions ”
“ I was not expecting a war too hard ”.
“ This will last 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all the players are used to their new role ”, as Miléna Vicenova began his presentation to the Faculdade de Law Ambassador Czech near the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various EU bodies and their relationship so understandable and visible, to the point that a large number of participants in the law faculty of the University Charles might envy, it has shown how it takes its motto “ understandable and openly about Europe ” seriously.
Mrs Vicenova has paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
“ From the outset were echoed the criticism that he is dull, that this is a round - of - leather, that he cannot rempplir no mission, and I must say that it has cut the inspiration to everybody because it takes its role to perfection. ”
“ This is a man who knows listen to 27 member states, of communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction of Europe. ”
She said the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and defence policy in the context of an answer to the question: “ who is that the European Union? ” “ has no telephone number to call? ”, as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater clarity of EU policy response to the states, like China or India.
Nobody wants to prohibit our syrecky (cheese cooked to paste which feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova reported also agenda that has lived, live and live in a time near the European Council.
She called the presidency of two years of succés.
The Czechs have resolved the financial crisis rising, the gas crisis or even hosted a summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She called the fall of the Government of very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassadrice, “ activity has beaten its full ” not only for the presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to move again now.
It must approve the new budget septimal Union who becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be thin and economies, which areas will be the priority, which countries will be helped the more, the least, everything is to resolve in future negotiations.
The Ambassadrice reiterated its slogans with which it came to Brussels “ Keep Europe understandable. ”
“ I do not really loves abbreviations, the foreign words, the jargon that nobody understands.
As the public must understand that it is true that in Brussels person does gherkins or round, bananas differemment or large, although nobody has prohibited to make syrecky. ”
It wants to make better use of the EU environmental and see more czechs in the european institutions.
A multi - speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassadrice the Czechs have the reputation of being the eurosceptics and people who do things that are more negative than positive.
Most of it is sorry to see such a small czech representation in the european institutions.
The fault, she says, to several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a low support for the Czechs.
In addition to a czech succés she then pointed to the strength and cooperation of Visegrad.
“ Believe me when I come to the Poles the Magyar, Slovaks, this french tells me: “ Hé, whether you are there, that is still this group of Visegrad? ” and it is not at all happy. ”
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, these are tough new rules on budget policy that awaits the member countries.
This is the concept of a two - speed Europe, if not at different speeds, prevailing rather than a “ new european federation. ”
“ We have countries in the euro zone and others out of the area. ”
“ We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute of enhanced cooperation. ”
First it was said that cooperation between the countries which want and those who do not want to stay in their corner. ”
“ There will be a lot of similar institutions and there will be a two - speed Europe really ”, expects Madam Vicenova.
From that point of view it has also enjoyed the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the foundations that all the issues that have an impact on the EU must be discussed between all the members of the EU and not just the memebres in the eurozone.
History of a brand:
The innovative IBM begins the second century of existence
If someone had to seek the notion that expresses the closer the strategy IBM, the nearest would be “ long term ”.
For a broad public IBM is a symbol of the revolution, is a firm felt very present and however since its creation has passed 100 years.
The basis of this long - term strategy has been thrown by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
It has left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved if people are willing to consider.
Its slogan “ PENSE! ” became “ footprint around which will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish 1935).
That was the basis of the culture of the company soignement drafted by Watson.
We thought for IBM means a long - term movements continued directed towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years ago, thanks to the fact that she always stayed true to its core values and, however, has not been afraid to change all the others around it.
This allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more “ has délaré for the anniversary, the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A system well prepared
Watson, in the 1930s, began to deal with its employees as Bata in the Czech Republic, the people of IBM were the only among the first american workers to have paid holidays, insurance paid by employers more a uniform of employee elegant and well developed a system of rewards for inventors and commmerciaux.
In the same way IBM has a sytème relations with the customer is well documented.
The society was initially inspired in the discovery of talent, as one of the first companies to have abolished all forms of discrimination and could well have choices.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the strategy anti - discriminatory, since this is a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano as the head of IBM.
It is working with IBM for 30 years and currently holds the post of chief of Ventes, Marketing and strategy.
IBM in recent years is what we call the jamy, brain - storming online from what are from many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that it has a lot of ideas – in the firm nearly half of working people.
An institution with a good name
That is the image of internal and external to the company to ensure a safe position in the areas of business.
“ Since the beginning, IBM had a concept rather institution that a technology company, ” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor of economics at the School of Economics Harvard and author of books on IBM.
“ IBM is not a firm technlogique but a firm that helps solve the problems of the world of business by using its technology, ” added Geogre Colony of the firm of Forrester Research Consulting.
As the company itself, there is a difference between enter the market and create this market.
IBM - or the “ Great Bleue, ” as it is known familiarly the US against its slogan - in 100 years it has grown up to become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is, of course, the firm technological versatile - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, accommodation, services Council at the level of the server products to nanotechnology.
It has many patents all the firms american technological and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among its findings to cater for example the distributor of notes, the payment card, the swap financial, the bar code or the disquette.
IBM has been hitting this year with 220 billion dollars the second biggest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time she dépassa Microsoft in 1996.
Outline in advance
These are not all the innovation and workmanship that took the preference of the client and the time - IBM for example has failed the bet on an operational system own OS / 2, service whiz online, or the IBM computer PCjr:
“ If your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot émotionellement stay hooked on the past, “ said Samuel J. Palmisano.
For that IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work, it will.
Has the difference for example of conccurent Microsoft which to base stands and remains in the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In the income IBM, services, which are trained for a fifth with software and hardwares, have a prominent place.
However still in 1990 she was with more of the motié participation of the strongest representative of hardware.
Since the year 2000 IBM has sold assets low yield for $15 billion, over cettre period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology perspective.
It continues in investment and even from 2008, when for the first time it has outperformed the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiating according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased the volume of investment.
Now it transpires that IBM is the current crisis without be worried?
The price action IBM progessé from 2008 in a rocket of 120 per cent, the net benefit of the firm continues to grow.
The company 's logo IBM is changing everything but not its values.
We can expect to what this giant flexible restrain other crises.
Story: IBM has from the slices of cheese until the flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York 100 years ago; she was initially difficult name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924, initially it was a brand used by a branch of a company in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was merging four firms whose history is linked to the ten year 80 of the ninth century.

Watson was for the company if irreplaceable that after 40 years of direction is his son who held the seat of director, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first language programming.

The worst vices of women: this affects you too?
If you ask men to determine vices typical of women, all, both are capable of “ out of their hole. ”
My dear lady, you are going to see in the following vices women who come to pump the blood of veins of men.
The purchases
Your half you made remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least a garment in a week?
You are simply buying and packages at the time of the sales?
In your case, you can talk about the purchases as a vice.
Some women believe that they should limit their passion for shopping.
But you say, which pass at lèche - showcase of clothes shops, search for oneself nice clothes and then try all onboard (the ideal of different colours)?
And although for most women buy either a hobby, it can become for human a hell.
Remember you just how many times have you say to your spouse waiting to enter …
Continuing dissatisfaction
“ I am not too big? ”
“ I would need to slim at least 5 kg – I should start doing sport? ”
“ I you like? ”
These phrases you reminder not something?
Yes?
You are one of those women who are fixated on their appearance.
This is not the issue that you should stop to take care of yourself, but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is still complain about his appearance.
The strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints are rising and more women become empoisonnantes.
The odre and clean in the first place
This is like a circus.
Wash the windows, the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, make the dust, strip the bathroom - and it twice a week.
You made the comments to your partner that it works with dirty feet on the ground, the children they have sullied the lavabo encrassé, the window of the room to stay, and that gives you a lot of work?
If you suffer from this obsession, try to remember that we should not exaggerate and that the order and cleaning should not be the first place in the family.
This desire harmless cleanliness, however, can spoil your relationships and even peace family.
The undermining of
“ The Met survêtement spent in the bin. ”
“ You put these accounts old socks still tomorrow? ”
“ A napkin rabbit has nothing to do with. ”
If you do on your partner this undermining of this way several times a day, you really the break.
It is obvious that you do not agree to harm you want everything is impeccable.
Perhaps if the men knew this, women do not have to do both of undermining …
Defamation, the persiflage
Defamation, the persiflage but also the insults against someone is also the home of some women.
Women are particularly relations and are happy to deal with issues like that, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps that each of us overlooks a small persiflage harmless here and there.
This is a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflent, even despise each other and are to their environment, particularly in working in a group of women – particularly dangerous.

“ This is it. ”
“ We have played the game with only one player experience, the rest were young. ”
“ But there is nothing to do, this is how it is, ” said Jacques Martin.
“ Alternative on replacement this was not enough and we could not resist ”.
“ We had just to simplify the game, inducing the palet outside of our area. ”
For this we had limits, “ has added one defenders P. K. Subban.

How have changed the price of travel since 1989
Until 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia only 5 travel agents to state: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agents then proposed for travel, especially in the socialist bloc, for travel to the west were very limited.
The czech tourists traveling for the holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A big exception for the period from 1962 to 1972, when he was allowed to travel in Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a tendency to the west and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for the czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it allowed nétait not for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for Tchécoslovaques) to travel individually even in the context of the socialist countries.
In cases where the citizen Tchécoslovaque wanted to travel individually by example in Poland or in the Soviet Union, it needed a letter of invitation if the individual was not permitted.
Travel agencies at that time were also travel to the West, however, it had to queue all night with a bag of sleeping or have a “ knowledge ” in the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The agreement for the currencies was the condition to travel to the west was denied to people “ politically incorrect ” who could not travel at all.
The currency czechoslovak was not, however, exchanged with others and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the agreement of currency exchange (western) for travel to the west.
The Czechs were more often than their holidays in the country where there were so many houses of campaign and chalets that the Czechs are buying and habit that lasts until now.
Travel the Czechs have since seen since 1989 great revolution.
Although until 1989 holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum, the Czechs have spent the last year abroad 4 million days of holidays in countries throughout the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the country is most popular Croatia when it was not possible to move freely up in 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The removal of visas in 90 years of the last century in neighbouring countries to the west have caused a huge wave of visits short - lived mainly in Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Tchécoslovaques could not long travel by plane to the west that everybody wanted to see at least one moment.
For example in Paris organisations to travel the Czechs were sleeping in tents in the parks because our income does not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a journey of Czechs was at this time to win itself with its own food cans, sausage, etc … in order to save.
Another important moment was also partly to crown the Czech who has enabled our tourists finally after decades of power freely buy currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wages have risen, which caused around 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have started since 1997 to prepare tower with links by charter air through contracts have greatly reduced the costs compared to what it was before.
In the late 1990s of the last century the Czechs had links without visas with almost most developed countries around the world to share the EU who later have facilitated our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of the tourism post - revolution, when was prepared the first charter air to a country exotic, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year every year as the charters direct air moving czech tourists in the remote hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
That is more than 100 Czechs alien who visit the country each year.
Still an interesting moment in this period which symbolizes our development post - revolution happened in 2008.
The 17 November 2008 the US has abolished visas for tourists and czech has enabled our country is completely in the group of developed countries.
Also the Czechs in 2008 for the first time in history has spent more than half of their holidays abroad, 3 (50%) and for the first time in history have spent more than 15,000 kronor per person for the holidays abroad including the burdens annexes. crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President but may end with a situation without a solution “ Pat ”
Nearly 5mois already football Czech is without President and there is a risk that the successor to Ivan Hašek at the head of the association of football of the Czech Republic is not known yet again after a General Assembly, which must take place Thursday at Nymburk.
However, there are still no agreement on what regulation of vote should proceed.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start to vote for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of football Czech.
Hašek has resigned in June and during his departure has called on his colleagues has come together and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future.
Only during the era after Hašek football came back to the differences between the chambers of the association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This is completely shown on September 16 when he had to choose a new president.
Delegates to the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the national house in Prague because the negotiation has been blocked, and it has not even been dealing with how to elect.
There is no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the representatives statutory or also officials invested full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since the moment also with the support of the Bureau for the state and the law that representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
The differences are still continuing on the regulation for the election.
It is all too clear that the executive committee, which in its negotiations planned or extraordinary, has contributed nothing to the situation
Opinions on the possibilitě voting has changed several times, but the problem remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round in order not to fall into the Pat.
“ The bone of contention is the following: either carry out under the statute or find another model ”, was one of three vice - presidents of the Association of football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association.
According to the rules of the model provided wins in the third round of the candidates who have received the most votes in percentage within the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw for that earns the candidate who has received the largest percentage of votes in both chambers.
And the Czechs studying the condition that the winner would have at least two - thirds of the percentage of votes.
“ Seulement this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and that would be completely reject the concept bicameral, ” admits Svoboda who understands the objections of the Moravian part and that it would be best not to change the rules and vote in the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also agree even if he believes that the regulation of elections set according to the statutes advantage most Pelta among all the candidates.
“ I hope that the vote is as much as the articles of association. ”
“ There is still no ideas insane dreamt up by a representative of the general sessions as in the past, ” said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time and in its exposed is set, especially against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him to Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates work together in the future together and constructively.
“ The qualification possible today in European Championships should calm everyone. ”
“ Football is again on a wave of happiness and one more more joy for cooperation, ” adds the officer Jablonec who among the three has vast experience in the direction of a professional football at regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
“ I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense. ”
“ This is not a problem between the people and the moravian, but there are trends to change the regulations to design ”.
“ This may lead to a new block to the General Assembly. ”
“ I very much hope that the healthy reason will prevail, ” said Rajchl.
There is not much time for a common agreement on all sides.
Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro, but who can say if the whole direction of football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight in which to travel to other Podgorice between the vice - presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not come off for technical reasons and we sought a variant to take a part of the executive committee on the ground of retaliation.
Has the end is the ministerial meeting, which could be held on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The education minister of youth and sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the sides torn within the sports association 's strongest countries and get them to an agreement.
In the game, there is a great deal: a state grant, the credibility of the football and also the General Assembly of the Union Czech Sport which must determine the direction of sport Czech after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to fight for the post of because he did not see any candidate correct.
If the head of the footballers Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile have responded to what it calls for a new President of the Association of football of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not be put in this campaign for high office.
“ If such a candidate is I support it, I fight for him and I do not come to the election. ”
“ But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate, ” said Paclik to the czech CTK news agency ().
The motivation of Paclik is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta access to the top of the AFRT which appears to be given favourites for this election.
Paclik also points out that in cases where it will be the election held the post of only until 2013 year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see in the office manager and experienced a high level but who is not connected with the football world.
“ I spoke with people who have the profile, ” he said.
“ For me it was terrible when some have told me that they do not want to be identified with the Czech football at this time. ”
“ I like to change this image, ” he added.
Which, it is said, especially Paclik embarrassment, it is the relationship between Pelta and President of the Union regional football Plzen Roman Berbr, man to the renowned controversial who is known in the wings as lobbyist able to influence the vote delegates “ the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies this position of President.
“ If they win, the current state and remain there would be nothing new in football. ”
“ And with the support of Berbr, which is a retailer of high - flying, it would be even less favourable to football, ” proclaimed Paclik.
What the worse still is the fact that the name of Pelta was made a few years ago during eavesdropping as part of an investigation into a corruption scandal, why Pelta has emerged without any trouble.
“ I do not know what prestige pelta bring football. ”
“ And how would we be seen in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA ” said Paclik, who said some time ago “ if Pelta becomes president, I sell the club Plzen. ”
In cases where Paclik win to Thursday 's vote, it should prove that this could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been backed by Paclik before the General Assembly in September which had completed by a fiasco, thinking the same thing.
“ He (pelta) would be the first with who I am. ”
“ He has great ability ”
“ It would be able to stand by example as head of representation. ”
“ But as manager of the Association is not capable of. ”
“ I am not the nose in that I do not know, ” says Paclik who in September drew wide attention when he called for the cancellation of the Committee on referees with Ludek Macela that has replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says that it would be the level to lead the organization.
It takes as its example leadership abilities of private firms and that he also leads since the last year the club Plzen which celebrated with his support in May his triumph at first division.
“ I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to make a certain culture. ”
“ I freinerais the influence of some interest groups who have, for example, tend to influence the disciplinary committee and call, which leads to situations in bad taste, ” added Paclik who do not chache his antipathy for the head of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It also would consider a harmonization of relations with the Olympic Committee Czech whose power lobby with the policies of high level would get for sport more tax money on Games.
“ This is one of the key points of the new President should address. ”
“ If it is the tax on gambling as saying the political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money is going, ” he said.
Paclik does not take its connection with the current club Plzen as something negative even if himself says that President of AFRT should be “ above the parties. ”
Pelta again is linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
“ This is not the ideal. ”
I see no reason to convey my actions club Plzen to someone if I have to come back after a year and a half, ” said Paclik.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT which should end the situations of Pat.
Two days before the General Assembly of the football association a candidate for the presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT have new statutes should end in the future squabbles over the regulation for the elections.
The official Jablonec is before the meeting Thursday to Nymburk very optimistic that the succés today representation of football should alleviate this wrangling before the vote.
Pelta before the election in September which has not achieved has promised to focus on national representation and obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly passed and the delay of two months could allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football and the present in a broader context.
“ People at all levels are football for a long time and expect Thursday there is a President ”.
“ They feel is the best time for someone to take the helm of the association, ” it added, but it is primarily associated with the club Jablonec, has worked for a number of years at Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
It is also why it has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned in lépoque of Ivan Hašek.
“ Unfortunately in the General Assembly, ” June statutes have been approved, which were not perfect as all have noticed. ”
“ If there were not all these various interprétattions we have already been a President since September, ” Pelta highlights.
This is precisely the revision of the paper 's most important civic association that has caught the attention of the delegates.
“ If I go, I take as personal mission and am prepared to take responsibility if it does not work. ”
“ This is a principle, without which we would not exist, ” Pelta said.
Then he tries, they say, not to confront adversaries.
He has said previously that he can work with Jindrich Rajchl that it recognizes its training in law and it knows that his opponent - candidate would be its first vice - president.
It has not attacked long Tonas Paclik who don 't criticise Pelta.
“ It is changing in football for a year and has already had some succés. ”
“ His attacks were not, however, of the most honourable and has surprised many people during the campaign. ”
“ That is also why some people are now doubts about his character, ” said pelta addressed to her opponent but remains, he said, faithful to the statements he made in September.
His weapon is that his knowledge of football from competitions the lowest level until the réprésentation national.
This should be a vitirne football.
“ And I am efforcerais also ended all affairs that begin with the Bohémians or the scandal of corruption. ”
“ I immediately entering into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money to all football ”, told the news agency the czech CTK 46ème candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of football would produce no change people.
“ I should get acquainted with all employees, ” he told Strahov where there is an understandable nerves since there is no leadership.
Although there are catastrophic scenario planned with the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
“ If there is one point of contention on the way to vote in the third round, will come to the end. ”
“ Football needs credibility and it will be when there is at its head a new leader, ” as the states of optimistically Pelta two days before the day probably crucial to his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT begin to work hard
“ If the Vice - President current Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Association of football of the Czech Republic in the General Assembly on Thursday that would not please many people, apparently.
Rajchl promises, however, where it would be elected one start to work hard.
He wants to systemic change and make the members of the executive committee are responsible for different areas of football.
He has also promised to settle the matter Bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, football more money and continue the work started by the predecessor Ivan Hašek.
“ As President, I want to play football as a whole. ”
“ International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national representation of professional football and a successful football for the youth. ”
“ But I am not saying that I will do this alone, ” said Rajchl in an interview for CTK.
“ I am a player and team want to distribute the powers of the executive committee so that each member has been engaged in a certain area. ”
“ And I will provide the difficult missions for football face a big step forward. ”
“ A lot of people will not be happy, because it comes to begin to work hard rather than criticise others, ” he added.
He cited, it is said, that he would not stand as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
“ On me, you know that I am working 20 hours a day. ”
“ But I need to know whether it is worth and if I have people behind me who I always put a spanner in the works and doubts about each of my actions, ” explained why he hesitated.
“ A lot of people have all said that I should not give up because they refuse, too. ”
“ Cest confidence that I cannot betray ”, he says.
What the motivation, they say, is to continue the work started with Hašek.
“ Since these last two years there has been a lot of fact and I do not want to let him down. ”
“ There are processes that have been launched which will have consequences in a few years, and I would not like someone the stop. ”, he said with the fear that in the case of the election by Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hašek.
“ I believe in a systematic work and is something that Mirek Pelta do not know what to do. ”
“ Derrière him are people who fairaient football so that there would be only for those who have been chosen. ”
“ You can criticise me a number of things, but certainly not tolerate somebody. ”
“ I try to be objective. ”
“ I want to play football for all, because everyone will be happy, not just those who have been chosen
And he again confirms that it would be only a President to the Czech Republic.
“ And if there are those who say the opposite, I am ready to do everything to Moravia. ”
“ For example, this is the time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts one and the other Czech Moravian whose winners are left at first division. ”
“ There is no situation as currently with only three moravian team in the division because the problem is to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club Plzen, entered the race for the job of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
“ I sense an ongoing support of the House Czech who elected his vice president and knows that with me there will be succés, ” said Rajchl which envisages among its future succés save tens of millions of crowns on contracts disadvantageous, negotiating contracts with television and on the law on games.
He said that the fact that the association is not united is a fault common to all.
While he said about Pelta “ that it is disqualified because with him the Czech footblal lose its credibility, ” he thinks the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has to offer football.
“ No one can doubt to Plzen he has done this year a superb job ”.
“ If he was elected he would continue surely in what was started by Hašek and would not be significant change among the people in commissions. ”
“ It would not be wasting its succés ” said Rajchl who evaluated his rivals.
The finest swimming pools of Europe
A leap in the blue
By Julia Stanek
Pataugeoires in view of ovni swimming pools, beautiful Budapest: who travels across Europe can live his miracle blue - and having turned the city or a long walk - may hinge legs tired in baths of fizzy water.
A book shows how basin swimmer can experience the most well - being.
When Iris Meder would travel research during the past 18 months, there is an object that should not miss in his luggage: a bathing suit.
Expanded on his back in the water, she observed cupolas artistically arranged, and nageait against marbles Putten who was waiting on the other side of the pool and was to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools of these converted.
If a pool covered with pleasure, she noted in its book without delay all the details of interesting on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were polled in this way by the historian of architecture Meder and have presented in his book published: “ Badefreuden (Joies of Bain. ” the covered municipal swimming pools of Münich, the palace of historical bath in the Black Forest, “ concrete buildings Hardcore ” in Taunus.
It has led its “ trips to the bathroom most outstanding of Central Europe ” in 13 countries. apart from Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited respectively places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The German of 46 years is a real strong culture bath.
Meder, explains that it does not have a lot of interest in the sport but ell feels drawn to the water in a completely different way.
It is irritating that fans of the swimmer should simply peering of noses clean blue and live with the stench of water Javel while the joggers inhale the perfume envoûtant forests of spruce or can listen to the trill of birds happy the park.
“ I wondered why a day swimming pools must actually be always so ugly, ” said the good viennese.
“ So I began a collection of fine bathroom. ”
The surface of the water strengthens doubling the architecture
A plunge in a swimming pool and sauna volatile oils - factor of well - being in the halls of swimming are enormous because all the lines are awake, Meder.
And if the builders will be given a little more trouble, rooms to swim could be a true delicacy to the eyes: “ instead of a floor has a surface water in the halls of swimming. ”
“ She is a transparent, but reflects on the other hand, however, the beauty of the entire building. ”
All surfaces are extend a twofold: voûtes high, noses clean multicoloured, pads.
The volume of image of miniature “ Badefreuden ” is a worthwhile report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of welfare historic – it certainly want to take a leap in the blue.
The collecting Meder discovered some remarkable copies during its research in Hungary.
Alongside the baths welfare magnificent as the bath Széchenyi aged 100 years in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a cave in the natural karst (bath cave in Miskolc - Tapolca), as well as a bath of spas whose basins are filled with water containing alcali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and are in a building in the form of a bottle.
By contrast, the heated swimming pools in the open air in Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. while a roof bath in Zurich is the whole city in his eyes, we can admire the Arlberg enneigé from a pool of external St. Anton: the turkish bath is fitted with a window on which we can observe the animation on the trail of skiing.
Perhaps the idea of swimming pool is the most extraordinary expects the swimmers in Längenfeld: the Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles a UFOS might who has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, the steam out of three open shelves, while in the background are the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of water Javel does not come from all the swimming pools of the vintage Meder.
Many thermal baths from the smell of sulphur, Árpád - spa in Bekescsaba hungarian from a strong smell of oil, that it is difficult to believe, to find themselves in a health spa.
The smell was from the waters alkaline levels therapeutic containing hydrogen carbon that is almost black and its limon you stuck to skin as soon as you allow yourself to slip into the swimming pool, spa experience special.
During his pursuit of beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also has suffered disappointments: when she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz free external, a swimming pool and outdoor of Czechoslovakia, she has been faced with a ground - up.
The bloodbath designed by architèque Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed.
Looking out of the window of the building - Art Nouveau in red, white and yellow, it has observed the flowering of the weeds between tiles.
She was an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the palace of spas of Bad Wildbad.
The building has already survived three phases; we may find not only features neo - roman who have emerged since its conception in 1844 but still a room in Alhambra Moorish style that has been added to it in 1900.
Since its modernisation careful of 1995, the palace spa bath remains the favorite of the expert in swimming pool, Iris Meder – and not just because it is from Schwarzwald.
“ This is a beautiful performance that melting styles of construction so different in a unit so wonderful, ” said Meder.
With such a palace, plunged into the pool thermale is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
The german bank examines in detail the speculation on the raw materials
By Christian Teevs
The german bank abandons its speculation in commodities?
According to information - SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has instructed a working group to seek the consequences of speculation for the world 's poor.
In January, the leader of the group then draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: according to a study, 84% of Germans find unacceptable that the banks are speculating in commodities such as corn and wheat.
Two - thirds of respondents even require that the german bank and other credit institutions discontinuent this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world 's poorest.
This is the result of an investigation Forsa on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report by Foodwatch in mid - October.
The author Harald Schumann stresses in this article that speculation scholarships in commodities, pushing global prices upwards and that banks share a complicity to global hunger.
The campaign to protect consumers with concrete action against the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, – even if the big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Speculation in commodities was originally introduced to protect dealers against price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts share meanwhile the view the gamblers were posted bids and demand - and benefit at the expense of very poor.
Ackermann responded to criticism differently from american competitors: it promised to investigate the accusations and said, “ no business is worth setting aside the good reputation of Deutsche Bank. ”
According to information from the SPIEGEL ONLINE a group of international work is currently investigating the accusations of Foodwatch - Report.
The review should be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the management board of Deutsche Bank should be presented with recommendation, usually.
In late January, the head of the bank will show the implications.
This could result in a reduction in the commodities market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built his image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode has welcomed the news, but at the same time has confirmed its criticism of the financial sector: “ speculation on rising food prices shows a draconian, how the banks today harm to the public interest. ”
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be today under obligation.
“ Deutsche Bank should remove all the placement of its portfolio, where money has been spent on food speculation, ” Bode said.
“ It matters little, for Mr Ackermann, if it is a matter of starving people or if the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake. ”
The awareness of Ackermann may seem surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a picture perfect, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank has announced Monday that the chairman of the Board of directors will not change what is planned in the Council of Administration.
Ll could improve its trademark with an abandonment of speculation in agricultural controversial.
And on the subject of possible losses, it has little to worry about them – his successor is concerned.
One in two résilierait placements on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain pressure on the manager.
So far more than 30,000 users have participated in the campaign of the organisation.
Bode published a poll on Tuesday, with which the 7 and 8 November the institute Forsa has carried out questionnaires from 1001 people.
Just 11 percent have found this legitimate that Deutsche Bank proposes placements for which bets on food prices are facts.
Many customers of the bank would also benefit of personal consequences if they learned that their bank involved in such operations: one on two résilierait, following the poll, all the places where money is being pumped into speculation in commodities.
43 percent déconseilleraient of such a bank to their environment, 49% said that they might think to the termination of their account to change to a bank. ”
21st home in Vienna
The flag that has moved
D Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a happy end: the flag for the austrian exhibitions world of Brussels in 1958 won prices, was a museum in Vienna, has remained empty, then fell into ruin.
Now it is again open and took the place of house of exposure.
If the enthusiasm for an architecture of post - modern war for its clear forms, its terminus in glass, its allures strong and bold and its new construction materials that are typical of the belief in the technical progress, then the flag of the architect austrian Karl schwanzer for exhibition of Brussels in 1958 and famous is a good example.
The Pavillon of Schwanzer got past the “ Grand Prix Architecture ” for its construction steel and glass, light and suspended.
The building is seen until our days as an important step in the contemporary architecture.
He has made the architects are so well known, he has also built the flag for the exhibition austrian follows.
With its legendary home to four coaxial of BMW and its adjacent construction in form of bowl in Munich, it finally became famous internationally in 1973.
Its draft flag as a temporary construction had been exposed after the exhibition in the Garden Switzerland to the station south of Vienna, has been transformed in 1962, and a museum of the 20th century has opened -
But the building was not physically and technically adapted for a museum - not walls to hang on the works of art, not a good environment.
But he has also long been used, so “ that contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building was empty and is increasingly battered.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavillon, it now bears the name of “ House of the 21st century ” and is used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere Palace Museum has opened, the house, which is the first exhibition, a stroke of luck at any point of view.
The new start has been carried out by Agnes Husslein - Arco, which has become the new manager in 2007 from the gallery austrian Belvedere Palace.
Husslein - Arco, has promoted a historian of art to a career between different in his youth of patineuse artistic, later at Sotheby 's, the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding director of the museum of modern art in Salzburg, she has led to particularly well the renovation work to the politicians and the protection of monuments, it had received state funds and private sponsorship and has established the exploitation.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose Foundation bears the same name have been exposed, a coffee and a bookshop are there, and an office must be built.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For achieving Krischanitz was the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed with sensitivity and extended the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that it had won the contest, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the flag was “ extremely important ” a place where he had seen “ virtually every weekend ” exhibitions.
He knew the original plan, and he knew the problems of the structure, which lost in generosity and lightness following his trip to Vienna and by his change of use.
During the current changes, there were big problems: the “ structure was “ a chasm in energy, ” said Krischanitz.
The profiles of windows and glass facades were changed, the insulating glass fibre reinforced glass raised the roof and was replaced with a glass of special security.
The thermal poutrelles bridges have been strengthened or replaced, coating and filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated.
Two basement have made room for the new operation, a billboard of light tamisé between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leading to the entry - that is almost a new construction, but always the slight Pavillon Schwanzer.
The doors to foreign origins remained, the house is painted in a bland protection against the rust - colored red - brown.
And the Chamber of cinema is identical to what it once was.
And all this under close surveillance of the competent authorities to monuments and with a small budget.
“ Souvent materials that are good and cheap to be found, and also to suit the Office for the Protection monuments, ” said Krischanitz and it draws attention to a gross soil in basements.
Despite all the constraints, the problems and transformations, the building “ remained soft and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavillon, “ which stemmed from Brussels, ” said Krischanitz recently, a history of typical “ Drop - in - the - City. ”
This architecture is “ still in the wrong place ” and wants to “ awaken despite all the good conscience. ”
But in this case the house of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if there is a stroke of luck: urban construction around the Garden Switzerland is precisely the “ district of the Central Station ” all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may happen: the house of the 21st century may benefit from the kingdom of another building Krischanitz, because the collecting Francesca von Habsburg has bought the centre of art temporary Berlin, and as he said, she already negotiating with the city to get a site in the vicinity of the Garden Switzerland.
Bahn is planning a crisis package winter million.
The society of the railways has devised a plan - crisis, which aims to prevent accidents train in winter.
The number of employees to double.
It costs millions.
In the battle against the train accidents related to the season winter and delays, the society of the railways Deutsche Bahn ” spend here more than 70 million more this year.
The daily Bild ” - Zeitung reported pre - crisis plan, citing an internal group, that investment of a total of around 300 million euros would be set until 2015.

The german bank Deutsche Bank ” pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case the head Josef Ackermann there is something new in the US: the german bank Deutsche Bank ” must pay a fine is “ running into millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past is catching up with the giant of the sector in the US: the Institute of Frankfurt pays compared to $145 million (106 million euros) to settle a dispute because of the bankruptcy of cooperatives five big banks during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of mortgage documents.
The regulator of financial markets NCUA door to big banks a whole series of accusations, and to encourage banks cooperatives to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they have played down the risks.
These documents have lost a great deal of value during the financial crisis and caused the bank to the bottom.
“ We are pleased to have been able to find a solution to this issue, without the initiate a procedure in court, ” said a spokesperson for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank has acknowledged no fault in comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which is committed to a payment of a sum of $20.5 million.
The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions on both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible cooperative banks in the US and it comes in the event of bankruptcy, to protect deposits to customers.
The NCUA trying to repair the damage incurred billions of dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first of their kind.
The regulator has also taken other big banks to part and he has been summoned before the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Regarding the issue of mortgage documents it is about “ Mortgage - backed securities. ”
The homes of credit are at the base.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking firms.
In September 2008, the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events dating back several years, at the moment it is blowing on US banks a wind storm.
Investors and the supervisory authorities brought numerous appeals for redress or to punish failures.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, the two financial house of “ american Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be an advantage ” in nature in affairs of mortgages to about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also must appeal to the FHFA, it is about several operations to a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities, asking that the Frankfurt meets “ substantial losses ” but not cite a precise amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the demands as unjustified and says they want to defend themselves.
WARREN Buffett increases of 10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, investing huge amounts of money into the company ahead of IBM.
Since March, he bought shares valued at more than $10 billion.
Until then the big american investor Warren Buffett explains constantly not investing in corporate computer it, given that the “ long - term evolution of companies do reveal that bad prognosis.
However, he read the reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
He had already understand much earlier that IBM proposes especially services and computer systems in the sectors it to other companies.
An investment from Warren Buffett is considered an attack of knight coming in the world of finance.
Therefore the activity it IBM grants the right to be called now “ Mr IBM. ”
Because Buffett revealed today at the “ issuing economic CNBC, he has bought since March of IBM shares worth $10.7 billion dollars.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM has never knew nothing of this commitment so far.
He congratulated the direction that even during the economic crisis was assured of reasonable benefits.
“ You have done a fantastic job, ” said Buffett strategically.
IBM set for some time on the lucrative services it as a ” operation centers accounting.
The pioneer in computer, more than 100 years ago, offers both software and consulting for calculating works very well.
Buffett had until now rather avoided the technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands business.
But Buffett tackles rather frêt rail, manufacturers of lubricants or machinery.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns roughly 80 subsidiaries and shares with a full range of large groups such as Coca - Cola or the Munich Re, the former Rück Munich.
This his 81 years had taken up in the 1960s ” the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and had built one of the most prestigious global companies, thanks to smart investment.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors the world over.
His almost foolproof way to earn money, has earned him the nickname “ Oracle of Omaha. ”
Following the announcement of the Buffett investment of the IBM shares have risen by one percent in the stock market.
“ Big Blue ”, which is also known as IBM, has a stock market value of a total of more than 220 billion dollars and account with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, said Buffett, they do not want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the “ cell Zwickauer ” the turkish media have doubts about the state of german law.
A newspaper speaks of a “ bloody ”, which would return now.
The killing of eight turkish nationals and a small greek company from 2000 to 2006 had a context extremist.
Following this new, Turkey and the population german - turkish reacted with fear and anxiety.
As for many of german - turkish spectrum that we thought death for a long time coming back: since the attacks of inflammatory Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable with this context extremist right - wing against the Turks.
Let there be in Germany a xenophobia, there has never been a question.
The right - wing extremist network has been detected, however, show proportions whose dimension is far from predictable.
“ Is this a return to the bloody ideology, ” “ Tel was the title of the Internet appeared on the turkish daily “ Haberturk. ”
“ The newspaper Sabah ” highlights the fact that one of the authors have been a v - man for the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the german authorities could be involved in the quagmire of extreme - right.
This is a reasoned that reacted the turkish community in Germany: she called this weekend in a silent memorial to victims of racial violence before the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks ago that the turkish community in Berlin and the german political and Turks thought to a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the recruitment of german - turkish.
It is with color gaies that cohabitation was staged, symbolizing a history of success.
The reports of some turkish media are a slap: “ the gift of Germany for the 50th anniversary ” that is the title of an article in the platform turkish - Haber “ X ”, which refers to the number of murders.
As the german publication of “ Hürriyet ” is happy to draw clear conditions.
“ It starts to puer Tel, ” is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
He pointed out that people have been murdered, have paid taxes and have provided by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The police action was seen very critically on the forums german - turkish and they subsequently debated the success of their research.
 Why he is not already come much earlier in the spirit of the german authorities to do research in some circles suspects right - wing, expressing surprise the authors.
More than one is prepared at least to rhetorical or drastic: “ if the case continues to be rushed, it will remain to migrants nothing other than self - defense and arms. ”
“ It will be the best self - defence ”.
“ The inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network ”, writing “ Selen. ”
What it means if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln Solingen and in the 1990s have explained.
The photograph of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in the memory german and turkish.
Because no other event has shown more clearly the Turks living here that there is a credible threat, and the Germans, on what the mistrust and distance by acts of violence could erupt.
The attacks have honed the feeling of us in the turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
Once it is mainly the failure of german politics after the attacks which the turkish press has complained: Helmut Kohl has refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolence at the head of the turkish state, has represented the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was at the time in his speech, how many taxes produced the local turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of tax burdens.
The current report of turkish media shows once again how the suspicion of many Germano - turkish is deep in the “ state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and revaluation of terrorism right - wing extremists in Germany, a clear message is this time necessary.
The bank scandal Lake Zurich
The bank the most adventurous of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has done almost collapse in the financial crisis and patina meanwhile from one crisis to another.
This is a german who must move now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber is “ was imagined.
After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank, was informed in July, that it would take up to 2013 a post nearly as spectacular: President of the Board of directors of the great swiss bank UBS - a major step towards an unexpected career and lucrative.
Axel Weber has publicly rejoiced, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its solidity recently obtained and passed to kind of comments on the future colleagues.
“ UBS has managed the Turnaround ”.
“ I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel. ”
And yet, as early as September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A merchant securities to UBS in London diverted all safety systems of the bank and had soared about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of UBS banker Oswald Grübel, a well - known not only in Switzerland, has had to leave.
The President of the board of UBS is seen since as suffering – and all ask: when Axel Weber is finally?
We have already learned that Weber may be advised Bank starting in February 2012.
And it will resume the presidency of administration already in May – not in 2013, as the bank reported Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
It is not a banker, much more teacher “ economy and President of the Bank, and it would certainly need a period of adjustment.
Suddenly he assumes the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has yet to prove once again that it has long had earned the title of “ the largest bank in Europe ”.
Indeed, UBS is enormous — until recently, it was the biggest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it is at a standstill for years for a scandal.
Nothing, it seems, is so proud of the swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image manager 's swiss assets, silent and sound, but also cunning, she had combined with ambitious targets: it also wanted to become, in the area of investment banking, a very large bank.
So UBS ran a side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
It made sense.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later a professor of Bank for many years in Zurich said: “ I have always taken UBS as a model of good bank to my students. ”
“ In the current context, one wonders: how is it that I could have simply me so wrong? ”
It is deeply wrong.
In 2007 that it appeared for the first time something was amiss at UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli was withdrawn in surprising ways, which was considered so far as a senior intellectual as well as a banker genius.
A few months later it was questioned why he was gone.
The division of the bank had soared with documents sub - premium and has had to write off billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and delivered a cross over.
Why she thought of investors, but that, shortly before, have raised a few eyebrows: a backdrop of asian non - transparent from Singapore and bottom of arab state, who was overlooked, to the point that we have never even heard his name.
“ It was that the first blow.
In April 2008 that has worsened.
The bank to announce further losses of billions, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second board the best paid in Switzerland, is sacked.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS was given his errors, investment in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank has bought at UBS tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for convertible bonds into equity, for which it could become copropriétaire Bank.
Any Switzerland has been shaken - because she noted how this can be dramatic for a small country, to accommodate such large banks.
Finally, the total stock of UBS 2007 “ increased at more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
“ We have not been able to salvage UBS once again, ” said the researcher of banks, Geiger.
After the first disaster followed in the second.
Already, a few months before, UBS had capitulated due to a tax dispute with America and was prepared to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who had defrauded the taxman perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million in reimbursement of unjustified profits from these operations with a fine increased.
And UBS has more or less published that it had helped to tax evasion.
At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich clients: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the secret swiss banking has been the same.
It was followed by withdrawal from the head of the board and chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of the money customers.
And the bank had lost in a few months, its credibility in the two sectors of matter: the main investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management because of aid for tax fraud.
And, as there was somewhat of a return to calm, and as it did, that UBS would manage, it was followed by this unfortunate history of merchants title: one dealer title rocketing 1.7 billion, before the bank discovered that something was amiss.
And being published: with the risk management by investment bank that still does not appear to work.
“ With the case Adoboli, it was noted that risk control to too little changed, ” said Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
Also the financial director of a major german bank is sure: “ the problem of UBS is that it did not risk control. ”
However, it was exactly the idea of caution, with which the swiss bankers had long since made their function, that to become guardian of the vast wealth of the world: not too much risk, but the security for the money – and the world could well fall beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of the swiss banks had become the symbol of an unyielding reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a chocolate especially noble.
The Central UBS to Zurich goes hand in hand with the sound cliché of the swiss private bank – it is a bit more.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in the central station in Zurich, which led directly to the central station at Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the summits enneigés of swiss mountains.
The buildings are here, the prestigious rents stores are among the highest in Europe.
The jewellers as Tiffany, we find them here between the shops of swiss traditions like those of confectionery Sprüngli.
For centuries of swiss bankers have resided here: the National Bank via the palace of Crédit Switzerland until private bank Julius Bär as elitist.
You arrive in the entrance hall of UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are clad in marble, before are thick leather chairs and, alongside the logo of the Bank, a major label for “ safe ”.
The UBS knows what the customer research here: security.
This idea of the swiss bank has one day out of the market – and betrayed the two big swiss banks, UBS and Crédit Suisse, as the leader of a small private swiss bank.
He would not read his name in the paper, finally as all bankers swiss it does business with the two big banks.
The UBS would become too large, he finds it – especially in the investment banking, where the Anglo - saxons are also widespread.
The swiss have nothing more to say.
“ And even if they have long since adapted to the mores of the Anglo - saxons. ”
This was indeed the investment bank Anglo - Saxon which has changed the UBS, has made high profits and then the debacle: no financial institution European has lost so much money in the jungle of sub - premium as the big swiss bank.
The disaster has become apparent on 15 October 2008.
“ On Wednesday, the coalition government of the small country to seven million people has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation, ” writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book “ the crash of UBS ”.
With up to 68 billion francs, approximately 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the bankrupt the large bank.
How could this happen?
If we are talking with swiss bankers, they see the problem especially to the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major swiss banks have concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for little Switzerland - and has been steadily increasing.
What has helped is that the two banks prédécesseuses different UBS have completed: a bank, but rich in lethargy with strong asset management in Zurich and a poor, but certainly already internationalized more strongly.
Suddenly, the investment banks have had much international access to lots of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, a leader of the group, UBS and Marcel Ospel, formerly chairman of the board.
“ I have always thought that Wuffli Ospel and are a dream team, ” said the researcher of banks, Hans Geiger.
“ Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which are very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, intuitive, who has fought her way to the summit with the learning of the bank. ”
But Ospel would trust so “ in the end to Wuffli.
And wuffli probably have committed to the end a fatal flaw: “ he thought that his models were the reality, ” Geiger said.
“ This is a tragic fall. ”
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.
The staff of UBS remembers clearly meetings of leaders in which the leader of the group Wuffli always gave the same watchword: displace Goldman Sachs.
The US bank was the investment bank, the most powerful in the world.
It has commissioned the “ League Tables ” rankings, which have documented at this time the success of banks.
After all the UBS wanted to climb to the top.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In case of foreign currency transactions and securities it has played a very important role.
The advisers, who had the responsibility, have pointed out, however, a weakness: in the international operations of interests, in the jargon banking “ Fixed Income ”, there is a huge difference compared to larger banks.
The UBS have deficiencies in terms of US mortgages.
To fill this gap, UBS has launched into an adventure, which has almost died.
Thirsty for growth, and it is as much the bank itself that a fund management created before it in placements sub - premium Americans who have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine which has packed up and moved the documents of value based on the US mortgages – but which has also retained the risks.
Even when other banks sought for a long time to come.
“ In the summer of 2007, while the US housing market was in flames, UBS has bought here, ” said Geiger, banking expert.
More euphoria is much more the fall is brutal.
A manager after another has to leave, when put an end to the attempts has proved more difficult than we thought.
The posts at UBS have become éjectables and are now bancaux.
Who runs the large bank has a virtually impossible task.
He has to find a strategy for a bank, for which all business models suggested disappeared.
The researcher, Geiger already has an idea: an end to the investment bank, concentration in the management of goods, return to the swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) so far.
But the investment bank should atrophying vigorously, provided that it is “ clear until now.
On Thursday, the head of Bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present the world its future strategy.
The Italo - swiss 51 years old was only supposed to be as a transition when the bank has separately with surprise of his predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, it has emerged: it must be sustainable business of UBS, announced Tuesday the Bank of Zurich.
Ermotti wants to bring the Investment Bank in the progress of the mid - 1990s.
It cancels 3,500 jobs.
But it will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What does it want to make money?
These are the questions that ” Axel Weber has already asked.
He said publicly so far only that he would seek an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

The smart corneilles spread to cities
In many places, freux are regarded as “ problem of birds ° "Listen, experts say that these animals are not very intelligent eject cities for a long time.
Some, like some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible and corneilles belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are increasing because of the muck and noise of animals.
An antidote to the ° "problem of birds ” is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on corneilles, experts have said that it is no longer possible to drive the freux cities.
Experts from all Germany deliberated on the possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
The protectors of nature based the problems of cities on the exodus of freux particularly protected: the use of chemicals in agriculture destroy more of the traditional habitat.
Hunting, planning and the slaughter of trees couvaison typical made life difficult for birds.
The corneilles are under the protection of nature.
There are large settlements with more than 600 couples couvaison in westfälischen Soest in the north - west, including Jever Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project won ads negative because of the massacre of corneilles in this region.
Critics have found the capture of the birds in their traps and killing with cudgels particularly brutal.
“ The deportation order, the ousting, achieves nothing, ” noted the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of black with the help of water under pressure or cut down trees, product often undesirable consequences, said the expert Manfred environment of Kaiser Lahr in Baden - Württemberg.
“ Animals differ, the major settlements are divided and they disperse in other places. ”
“ The drive is possible only in exceptional cases as in hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
“ We are forced to live with them, we can no longer kill them. ”
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor of Wolfgang Kellner Leer.
Conceivably, is a combination of the ousting of animals to a conditioning aversif and offers catch, in order to allow it to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospectait “ panels of info in place of chainsaws ” to establish relations with completely different: “ ultimately we can better withstand a button in the face with a dose of confidence in itself. ”
Jürgens has co - founded Ascheberger - path - education of baskets in Schleswig - Holstein, road signs informing them of the lives of these freux very intelligent.
The project has since been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: “ this is a great number of communication, these birds will have much to say. ”
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: freux do not use only instruments of work to reach a pleasing but they make themselves their tools as instruments of work.
The éthologistes of Cambridge University tested four freux recently, how come the intelligence of birds.
In an experiment, the birds learn quickly that they should do a scaffolding collapse with stones to achieve a larva.
Without much training, they recognise déterminément that a stone was having some grosseur and form to collapse the platform.
In a second test, the corneilles astute then need to solve a problem more trapu.
In a cylindre placed vertically, researchers had set a little bucket with a larva.
The birds could not achieve their spoils with their beaks.
However, the researchers had set pieces of thread at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the little bucket of small hose.
Three of the four freux we succeed even from the start.

The mass culling staff
The new book by Peter Englund provides depth and generosity. entitled “ the Beauty and the Sorrow year: Intimate history of the First World War ” (the beauty and the sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), it starts with a long list of figures who you greenhouse the heart.
A council to begin with: tear up carefully this page and do your brand - page.
You will learn to know these people in detail in this story, romantic of Peter Englund, this list of figures will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be disrupted and desperate in the fog of war.
Peter Englund is a historian and swedish journalist.
It is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for literature.
He wrote a book out of the ordinary that it describes, accurately, as “ a book of anti - history. ”
It contains a few names, the relevant treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussions on strategies and the material.
This is not a book about what happened, explains, “ Paper outlining how it would look like. ” we find there, “ emotions, impressions and experiences and moods. ”
“ The beauty and the grief ” sums up the experiences in war of 20 men and women more or less ordinary, on both sides of the war, young schoolgirls and botanistes for climbers, passing by doctors, ambulance drivers and sellers.
Some become heroes.
Other prisoners of war, and some will lose members, will become insane or lose their lives.
Their lives get cold feet here as the candles on a church: while some faded away, it revives new.
The book by Peter Englund departs from the history books.
It gives the lie to the notion that the First World War is more than the terrible war trenches on the western front.
“ The beauty and the grief ” ably described other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under the hives; one Christmas happening in Egypt under the pyramid; the flies tsé - tsé are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invaded the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina that reeks the cordite.
When shots to Canon jangle away, and that you are a mother at home, stay - you or evade you?
That will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, “ the lack of facts was amplified by assumptions, expectations, fears, ideas fixed, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors. ”
“ The beauty and the grief ” follows the likes of Florence Farmborough, a nurturer english in the russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young marine fleet of ocean - german.
Their stories are mainly from memories, letters and other documents already released.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying and exciting, but are more preserved through the accumulation of small moments and details isolated.
Most tackle deprivation and ability to cope.
By sharing the story of a schoolgirl german Peter Englund, writing: “ Ersatz, ersatz everywhere. ”
“ Coffee replacement, forged aluminum, imitation of rubber, bandages paper, wooden knobs. ”
It carries on food alternatives in Germany.
He describes “ meat made of crushed rice cooked in fat sheep (and ended with a false bones of wood); tobacco made with roots and dry skin dried potatoes; the soles of shoes wooden. ”
He says that “ 837 meat substitutes allowed are registered in the production of sausages. we also find 511 cafes substitution. ”
Some stories address honour and courage.
An American acknowledges its own pulsion towards the savagery and says about war: “ you feel that it is, after all, what the men were intended, rather than sitting in an armchair comfortable, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and instead of pretending that such a veneer is synonymous with civilisation, and that there is no barbaric behind your shirt empesée and cloutée.
Conversely, a british serviceman is aware that there is a high risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention.
“ When is resigned to sacrifice themselves, we hope to have an audience, ” he writes.
Unfortunately, this is rather similar to “ a condemned man strangled in secret. ”
Other observations about the decline of an old and a new types of terror.
“ The conflict is increasingly becoming a history of economic competition, ” writes Peter Englund, “ a war between the factories. ”
It captures the arrival of what he called “ a new species bestiaire at the start of the century: the mass murderer, articulate and convinced ideologically, clothes well made, which carries out its gory while sitting behind a counter. ”
People are unexpectedly; there are so many basic behaviour of heroism.
Peter Englund says soldiers who tried to catch a disease vénérienne among prostitutes in order to avoid the service at the front.
“ You find the most grotesque in the trade of Nor, due to the gonorrhée, that soldiers are buying and ” period of reproductive organs in the hope of ending up in the hospital, ” he wrote.
“ The more desperate to apply on the eyes, which translates into a blind to life. ”
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is soft but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he understands how the war has “ unleashed the forces exclusively uncontrollable: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to the religion. ”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are a war.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, as “ Great War Memory and Modern ” (the Great War and the memory of modern) Paul Fussel, or the west has “ nothing new, ” Erich Maria Remarque, rather than full.
The book by Peter Englund is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most damning that I have read in a non - fictionnelle.
I do not divulge.
But it is as if it had emerged from his book, seized on your hands this page that features the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first, a meticulously planned operation
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be most empty.
The operation is being kept secret from all except a few high - ranking officers, as well as other information from the outset that they would carry out a year.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlights the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
It could not be no repetition of “ episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of gas poivre against demonstrators, which went against the regulation of the department and have created a storm of public solidarity with the protesters.
The operation to clean up its Zuccotti Park protesters has been deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police are “ were prepared by observing the conduct of business in other cities.
A crucial year was held on the “ island of Randall, in view of the operation at Zuccotti Park.
The police officers receive better training against the riots - anti - terrorism measures which are to move quickly to a large number of police - to focus on the district of Lower Manhattan.
The training session last Monday evening, the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to travel in the park were able “ to the last minute, ” said the veterans, referring to the operation as “ a simple exercise. ”
“ The few police officers that I know and were called did not know they were going to Zuccotti Park, ” said the person under anonymity.
“ The only to know that they can make the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department. ”
The city has managed to retain a lesson, where the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, the police wanted to clean the park but has been postponed by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
The operation on Tuesday included officers from several police units, including operational strengths of all the neighborhood - dozens of officers used to neighborhoods particularly criminals.
Mr. Kelly said that many people came and went in the park during the day, in the manner of migrants. an hour of the morning was a propitious time.
“ He had to do when the park was the least of people, ” he said.
Vehicles of the emergency services fitted with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the bridge of Manhattan, before intervening.
The lights and messages recorded resounding loudspeakers seemed to intimidate protesters.
While the officers to the Community Affairs entered the park fitted with their thumb - wind blue, many demonstrators gathered just their business and are parties.
No attempt has been hit before 1h45 said the police, which has left the time the occupiers to gather their belongings.
Other teams of police officers have been dawned on the perimeter, ready to intervene if the arrests had been needed.
Journalists present inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said that this measure had been taken solely by security.
But after many journalists, the police have stopped to observe the speech inside the park, once held by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the trucks of television cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police was moving to the west through the thick undergrowth of business of demonstrators, including luggage, the lawn and plastic bags of leaves full of clothes, teams of the Department of Sanitation followed, cleaning everything that the occupiers left behind them.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. the images were broadcast on Internet shortly after.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the camp 's kitchen, not far from the centre of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that police had moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicentre of the camp are hooked together.
Finally, two people were chains to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The emergency services were called for cutting the cadenas.
No arrest has been held in the park before 3h30 said Mr. Kelly.
According to the police, the cleanup operation ended around an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, almost 142 people have been arrested in the park.
Most for “ disturbing public order and rebellion. ”
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most officer ” to “ be found at the scene.
T. Phil Pulaski, the department 's chief of detectives, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although now, “ do not directing operations, ” said Mr. Browne.
A second group of policemen patientaient along the side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of need for intervention.
Barricades were asked about Cortlandt Street, a pâté homes in north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, in the south.
It was the police extend well beyond the perimeter of Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, have even been seen pushing people and removed them.
Nearly 28 people were in the north.
One of the most intense night took place in the south of the park.
Towards 5h00, south of Pine Street, a demonstrator has jumped on the overturned a police car; others have been sighted in the process of breaching the tyres of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of contreplaqué has arisen as a wheel of the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalised.
The union of school aid continues the city for redundancies
The union that represents hundreds of school aid have lost their jobs last month, plans to launch a trial Wednesday in the city for redundancies unnecessary and discriminatory, and the impact is disproportionate to schools with disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The prosecution was probably the ultimate weapon of the union, District Council of 37e, to try to overturn the redundancies.
Six hundred and sixty - 12 school aid, coordinators of parents and other employees, part of the less well paid the city, have lost their jobs on 7 October. union leaders have compared these redundancies at a political vendetta for not having left the city access to a fund for health care led by groups of workers, and that would have enabled us to close the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation.
At a hearing of the City Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the redundancies were part of the budget ending in June.
A member of the Council has fought back, mentioning that redundancies aid school “ were not specified in the budget.
The officers of the Council of the District 37e said they fulfilled a notice of complaint, warning the Department of Education that he be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the prosecution to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city will be the defendant. plaintiffs will be represented by eight workers redundant, all black or origin latin american, as most of the aid school who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the legal department of the city, said that the city has not yet seen the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of the complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union bet on the number of redundancies in the schools of the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools lose the most aid due to a sub - regular funding.
While there are no redundancies on Staten Island and some barely in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 aid school have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th districts of the southern districts of the Bronx.
Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employed to public school 36 of Harlem, where 68% of children living in poverty, the prosecution claimed that “ this is not a district of wealthy parents who can bring funds to fill the gap. ”
The budget of the “ public school 36 has been reduced by 3,26% this year. funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of the additional funding for each pupil enrolment of disadvantaged. ”
The union also says that the directors of high schools have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of parents.
The memo employed the term “ exceeded ” to describe the action, even if “ exceeded ” described more generally action to move a teacher at a school for a group of workers available whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, “ sixty - six coordinators of parents have been made redundant, ” and “ not only because they have exceeded. ”
Mission completed: Congress reach an agreement on the issue of Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took an uprising succeeded, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Qaddafi as well as american involvement.
The Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate must make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democratic - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Indépendant - Connecticut), applauded the libyan people for their revolt and american troops for their “ courage ”.
“ This resolution is to honour the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country, ” said John Kerry.
“ This is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations. ”
The language may be harmless but the debate on Libya has never been easy so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the wording of several resolutions to approve or reject the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain have tabled a resolution to authorise the use of limited american military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a large margin bipartisan and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate.
But the same day of the failure of the bill, the House also rejected a measure to reduce the funding of US operations in Libya.
The american mission is therefore remained under a form of purgatory legislative - Congress sufficiently upset to criticise the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to pull the rug out.
The indecisiveness of Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli has fallen below the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission has formally ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations “ congratulate the libyan people for their courage and determination in extraordinary view of freedom ” and “ commends the men and women of the american armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the libyan people for their courage and professionalism fantastic. ”
The resolution also says “ the national interest of the United States to achieve a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya. ”
The new measure will win it all the support of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or divide the legislators as in June?
Senator and Commission President Richard D. Lugar (Indépendant) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of new project.
In the Capitol, the House will vote this week an amendment to the constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or the Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to approve their amendments, but it is not without having tried.
The amendment by Goodlatte is part of 68 constitutional amendments to be presented to Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some recurring themes – the same draft legislation proposed in both the House and the Senate, and others are slight variations of a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only for a balanced budget amendment, and another handful who “ control federal spending. ”
Some of these bills are identical, but their support – including the new Republicans who want sweetening their CV - the chance to claim to be “ the author ” of such a measure.
The law on control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved in August asked the vote in the House and Senate on the amendment to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non - binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates during which members of Congress can be used, while José E. Serrano (Democratic - New York) want to lift the limit of two terms for the presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Illinois Democrat) has proposed a series of amendments, which guarantees the right to a quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between people of the same sex is perpetually proposed, just as the amendment forbidding the desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers want to also allow the cancellation of federal laws if two - thirds of the states are opposed.
Too greedy that were the members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111e Congress, lawmakers have proposed amendments introduced 77, and 66 at the 110th.
The pace is slowing in the early 1990s, when the members proposed generally more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the library of the Senate.
But they did not have much more success than they have today.
The last amendment to have been added the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed in Congress in 1789.
“ Massacrée but not beaten ” says Gabrielle Giffords in his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman fired on him at close range at Tucson 's Representative Gabrielle Giffords, the Arizona Democrat (-) emerged on Monday evening in a television programme, sang “ the Sun Will come tomorrow ” Out of Broadway and has said it wants to recover before all rather than return to Congress.
During his appearance on the nightly news “ 20 / 20 ” on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords has struggled for form sentences and needed help to walk.
“ The programme has approached his return difficult following the ball which has fractured his skull and damaged the left side of the brain, walking through the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the shooting in January that killed six people and wounded 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled and laughed, sang, and described her recovery as “ difficult ”.
After that Diane Sawyer asked how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years, said “ quite well ”.
The meeting with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, has been held in a special one - hour edition of “ 20 / 20 ” broadcast, the eve of the exit of the couple 's new book, “ Gabby: a history of courage and hope. ”
The “ issuing special has described the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos shot by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, we see on his hospital bed, his head and razed a large scar on the front.
It manages to use one or two fingers only, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair when doctors told him to do the simple things.
A nod.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: “ when ”.
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords has chuchoté another word (“ toast ”) to ask to change the menu of his breakfast.
The footage broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: when the representative to sing with doctors air Cyndi Lauper 's “ Girls Wanna Have Fun ” and Tom Petty “ Free Fallin ”? ”
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, every day that passes two hours with doctors, has said that he does not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, it was him read an article about the shooting of the March 12 when she stopped and asked for the first time information on the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a prison in Missouri and vigorously Treaty pending trial.
“ There has been a lot of deaths, ” said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
“ Dur, hard, very hard. ”
During her recovery, said Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, she said, “ I have been beaten. ”
“ So I would say, “ Gabby, you have not been beaten, ” said Mark Kelly.
You have just been massacred.
And you 're going to get by, you recover and come back even stronger than ever.
More please respect for troops
The event: a night on Wall Street to reap millions of dollars for the homeless veterans of the city of New York.
Rock kid sang a Ballad on powerless, the frustration and the loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marine around him.
The crowd a suit - wearing is rose to his feet to applaud.
“ The military, men and women, are considered heroes, ” said David Saltzman, organizer of the fundraising in the spring.
A high - level military now at night, also attended the Admiral Mike Mullen, head of “ supreme commander of the armed forces of the United States, has seen the role of troops in a different way.
“ They have been presented as a kind of orphan, ” wrote the high - level military in an email.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But this “ was not respect. just pity.
The contradictory impressions absolutely illustrate the difficult relations who have settled between the military and an american public passionate but often distant.
Praise are dished to troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some military.
The public is increasingly as if he was sorry for the men and women in uniform.
“ We are not at all of the victims, ” said Brigadier General B. Sean MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and is due to go to Afghanistan.
“ But it seems that the only way we support is to lock ourselves in the role of minds unlucky. ”
This is a very sensitive subject for the military rulers, who do not want to appear not grateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also that the anger of troops revenantes of the Vietnam war was far worse.
Thus, most of the conversations on the mercy are held in confidence among veterans.
After the return of his two sons of the battle with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian the pensioner has warned that the public would see their service from two perspectives.
Some watch with respect, because they were faced with insurgents and travelled to distant lands.
Others may be asking if “ a veteran angry and violent lurks beneath the surface ” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who were moving interviews asking for subtle way if he would be able to cope with the stress of jobs in Washington immediately after her return from battle.
“ When you raise the issue of the service, you are facing negative impressions, ” Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his son.
The difficulties of military arise, in part, from the american indifference towards the wars.
The victories are rarely acknowledged in a country as little familiar with the army and who sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“ As a nation, we do more value heroism in the same way that for the Second World War, ” says the retired lieutenant general David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and people focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a military.
The troops are recognized for the number of times services endured, the number of lost friends or the extent of the injuries.
The army is facing growing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a hearing to decide if capital 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for an alleged inaction on rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants prepare the next.
The soldier from 1st class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant 11 weeks the night she says she was raped by a soldier.
“ This was in October 2008 and returned to its barracks to Air Station Miramar, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend when she visited a colleague with a pack of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“ It ” was a warning signal, ” said Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texan has set aside his concern.
I thought: no, he has 19 years.
“ It is of Texas, ” she said.
“ I have to keep my intuition. ”
A few minutes after they entered the house of Elizabeth Lyman, the man was caught from behind, thrown by land and raped, claims it.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military, some still in service and others not, wait anxiously court decision in a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a lawsuit brought against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not have stopped the spread of rape in the army, thereby violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial was initially 17 complainants. that number rose to 28 months following - 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. they also claim that the army has not investigated and prosecuted or provided justice adapted after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says attacks on military galonnées, because the problem starts with them.
“ The army is a vertical structure, ” she said.
“ Who are the people in position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? s leaders. ”
The lawyer also says that since February, it has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of which could be part of future prosecution.
Its strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all his eggs in one basket - it bring several trials, if necessary, to keep up the pressure.
The team of the defence, to the Department of Defense, led by the american lawyer Neil MacBride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailing the strategy of defence, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
According to a decision by 1950 Supreme Court, called the Feres Encyclopedia, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by the personnel on active service.
“ The allegation is inherent in the military service of plaintiffs ” the documents indicate.
The Department of Defense has refused to make any comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women have not yet officially, the right to go to the fight, this distinction is that on paper: the frontlines of the recent wars are rarely only male.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, the teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, particularly to come into contact with local women.
Result: on those two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives – two third fight.
It is time for the military to modernize, says Susan Burke.
It is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in most of his own.
Has the “ school of law at Yale, the centre of legal services for veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging an atmosphere misogynist.
On the other hand, the Foundation for - profit Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a case against the army, by focusing on the diagnosis of “ turmoil ” awarded to victims of rape in order to give them leave – a fact relatively ordinary, according to activists like Anu Bhagwaru Service Women 's Action Network (Action Network women military), a group for human rights.
His group has filed a lawsuit in December for the Veteran 's Administration, on charges of discriminatory practices in how to deal with applications for benefits for people claiming to have been victims of a sexual assault in the service.
Nine bills independent of each other have been submitted to Congress by a mixture of bipartisan senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported from the centre of intervention and prevention of sexual aggression (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) the Department of Defense.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assault is underestimated. indeed, according to the Pentagon 's own estimate, this figure represents approximately 13.5% of 19,000 incidents this year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecution: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army have been the subject of a trial - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first in a series of injuries.
In the case of Lyman, it informs the military police rape less than an hour after the fact.
That night, she said, he has been asked to recount details 11 times in her rape at various police, doctors and commanders.
She has suffered a “ rape kit ” (literally a rape kit), and the blood of his attacker, due to a power outage in his arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting before a judge, in a trial in which it asked about his sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier in the day of his aggression.
Six people have shown as witnesses of morality to the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“ I remember the day when the verdict was delivered, ” said Elizabeth Lyman.
“ I thought I had to begin having contractions. I have started to cry after the court. ”
“ I have been placed in the psychiatric unit, and when I leave, I remember saying to my commander “ it was not his trial but mine. ” ”
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who finished in diagnosing a disorder of the personality, making it unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was back in terms of less than honourable, preventing him from receiving any advantage.
Is that the case Lyman and other plaintiffs argue or not, it is a long history, says John Turley, professor of law at the law school at the University of Washington.
However, he said, “ in my opinion, they should be able to move forward. ”
Only this doctrine criticised since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticised the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and deterrent posed by the responsibility.
“ The chances are heavily against them … but it is important they are trying, ” it added.
These things are changing only when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favour, Susan Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, will bring together hundreds of other plaintiffs in other trials.
“ We will continue to fight against the army on this issue until it not be reformed, ” she says.
Where so “ that we would, one of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just a guy doing part of its anti - immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged having been taken of a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was facing its first trial.
When Breivik has a single, it was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent a lot of time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support the right - wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy … Connectez you on Facebook.
“ We realized that it was not as difficult as that of the return, ” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report published recently by the panel of DEMOS on populism digital in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could just use the tool advertising the site to find the people they seek with a scientific precision - how mercaticiens have been doing it for years.
“ The team of Jamie Bartlett has discovered that a half - million members are fans of right - wing groups in Europe who was targeted with announcements, but instead to link them to a new group, or product announcements invited users to respond to an inquiry. questions about their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
In come into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question 10,000 followers of 14 right - wing parties in 11 european countries - without leaving the office.
“ This is a new way of doing research, ” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some of the results are not at all surprising: supporters of the right - wing groups are instead of men, young and immigration.
But surprisingly, “ those who associate activism online and off - line are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screen. ”
“ The study of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook has become the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
The focus groups, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study all the issues that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to the “ I love, ” publications on the walls and updates of statutes.
With more than 800 million active users that add on average three content per day, the “ data ” generates a supernova explosion in research, increasing the number of research on whose behalf the site appears in the title of nearly 800% over the last five years.
For researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to look for people you could not get in the street.
“ Before, when you try to carry out investigations on the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them. ”
“ You had to go to the party, but they do you have never allowed to enter, ” says Jamie Bartlett.
“ Facebook is avoiding all that - you have direct access to their information. ”
Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and treat health and social problems.
According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin - Madison, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke of their exploits on Facebook while drunk were much more likely to be alcoholic that students discreet about this.
Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as advisers, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student whose status spoke too often alcohol.
“ You cannot deal with a problem if you do not diagnosed ”, Dimitri Christakis, co - author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Health, behavior and the development of children in the Research Institute for children located in Seattle, told the Washington Post.
“ We know how to identify the children at risk, and that would be in another case not recognised. ”
Facebook also accesses constantly to information of its users.
“ The team at the site, which is looking data has studied statistics regarding the situation in love and the day of the Saint Valentine, the turnout in the mid - term elections of 2010 and an index of national happiness (thanks to information only available - champions of freedom digital have long argued that the site could make available a treasure trove of data to other people for research purposes).
But users of Facebook knows that the site the observed, that their liking or non - power play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when the users of Facebook are part of an investigation that they do not even have heard?
While researchers have clear instructions on how to collect the information other than via the Internet, it is anything else online.
“ I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought to the fact that researchers can examine their profile, ” says Neil Selwyn sociologist, of the Laboratoire Connaissances London, according to a study in 2006 that he has conducted by observing the Facebook walls of its students.
“ Gone that they know, the exchanges were seen by their friends. ”
And then the question of methodology.
Even without the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the extent of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
“ What you say on Facebook and what you do in the real world are two entirely different things, ” says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a researcher technological, Neil Selwyn think a block - notes and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
“ Nothing can replace the real world and the contact with people, ” he says.
“ The social studies are meant to address the social aspect – and the social, this is not in front of a computer. ”
“ Froid and inhumane ”: first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted having organised the two attacks that have made 77 dead in Norway this summer, has been described as a champion of the “ resistance ” in his first appearance at the trial, which is being held in Oslo.
“ I am a military commander of the norwegian resistance movement and templiers of Norway, ” explains in a courtroom full of 500 people.
“ As far as the jurisdiction of the court, I repudiate it, because you want your mandate to organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism. ”
“ I recognise the facts but I am not pleading guilty. ”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim stopped Breivik during this monologue, because it “ does not want to give him the opportunity to use the trial to express his opinions. ”
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who has brought with it a speech on paper, talk to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim has also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks, he was told not to talk to the media during four weeks and has warned that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and connections for eight weeks.
Thirty of survivors and relatives of victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of watching Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that it would be placed behind bars.
All attended the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
“ I thought it was cold and inhumane ” said a survivor of Utoya to the norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“ I was not comfortable, but I have a little progress after having seen and heard the suspect. ”
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, he looked at the journalists and the survivors in the eyes while coming in and out of the court.
Despite the bizarre idea that Breivik belongs to a movement of “ resistance ”, the judge has determined that he was not insane. it has also said there is no evidence that he has acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which can be absolutely certain.
But this does not reduce the distress or confusion felt by the entire nation.
“ I would have preferred that he looks like a monster, but this is not the case, ” said a relative of a victim.
“ It would have been much easier. ”
7 from the interview lost of Steve Jobs, the cinema this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some have compared to Henry Ford - with the technical genius and inventor of the modern computer.
But what the fans of Apple can find more revealing in an interview of Steve Jobs found recently and which will be published this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is to what extent this creative spirit had understood the process and flow of work product.
It was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. it identified a hippie but was also very meticulous and organised, and a améliorateur structure of – a man who believed that many business leaders were suffering from a “ disease their belief that a clever idea is 90% of work … [but] a lot of manual work separates a clever idea of a product of exception. ”
In 1995, Bob Cringely on the tv series “ Triumph of the Nerds. ” this series runs through the birth of the computer, and it sits down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs and rare for a long conversation.
This time, it was nearly 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. it was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the conversation with Cringely is used in Nerds, he says that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after the death of Steve Jobs a video complete is found in the garage of the filmmaker.
This video, slightly energized, is the basis of the film on 68 minutes “ Steve Jobs: the Lost Interview, which will be broadcast to cinemas next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating the detailed discussions, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to exhibit philosophies technology and business strategies.
And incredibly close.
On four different points in the conversation, the answers come a long time after the questions – between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, in which Steve Jobs weighs clearly his thoughts, in order to give a precise answer.
It is also finding moments when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs resurfaces, where it seems anxious to hear the questions of Cringely, giving way to the move and move to questions or issues of greater importance.
Filmed before the “ era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there is something oddly prescient on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what it considers of good or bad in other companies and expressed his own vision of the future of computing.
It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something gross and drawing on the man we see here, the dreamer anxious on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision for how things can be and must be.
It explains the then put forth.
Here is a quick recap of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he learned to lead a company:
“ In all these years, I have always asked: “ why are you doing this? ” and the answer is always the same: “ oh, simply because we need to make them. ”
No one knows why, no one thought in depth of things in a company.
This is what I discovered.
Steve Jobs continued in giving details of his effort to simplify accounting for Apple.
Baffled as to how the costs were recorded there often begins with a “ standard ” cost estimated at view of nose, then adjusted with a “ variation ” – he has developed a factory automated that guaranteed the precise calculation of trading costs.
On the opportunity to play a round to the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the Bleue “ box ” that he created with Steve Wozniak, a device which served to hack into the phone telephone networks and charge in long - distance.
The device has been the subject of numerous writings beforehand, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the box Bleue as an act of ownership is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak has tested the box by using a public telephone, then in a call to connect to a network AT &amp;amp; T to another while bypassing all satellites as possible.
“ We enveloppions the crystal different things half a dozen times and you hurliez phone in the public and that you arrived a minute later the phone public next door, ” explains jobs in riant.
“ We were young and thanks to this box Bleue, we learned that we could even create something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world. ”
We did not know much both, but we were able to invent something capable of controlling things; it was a lesson incredible, and I do not believe that Apple would one day existed without it.
Steve Jobs continued in narrating a wonderful turn that he and Wozniak have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the box Bleue in the middle of the night by masquerading as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the catholic hierarchy are summoned to the middle of the night to speak to the american diplomat, the two accomplices go mad laugh, just before the Pope himself is awake.
On his love with technology and telesales (Bill Hewlett):
Has the “ age of 12 years, in the hunt for spare parts to manufacture a fréquencemètre, he seeks the number of Bill Hewlett in the directory and passes a phone call.
Shortly after their conversation in 20 minutes, Steve Jobs gets a job of been part - time at Hewlett - Packard.
“ This has been a remarkable influence on me, ” was the only company that I had seen at this age, and this has trained my definition of a company and how employees are treated. ”
Steve Jobs is subsequently became one of the employees HP to visit the research laboratories in the company, based in Palo Alto, where he discovered the “ first computer office ever conceived. ”
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small CRT. I have fallen in love with.
The teenager that I was “ HP has returned home and began to write programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
Several times in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on a whim.
At the beginning of his career, when he moves to sell a few cards printed circuits, a customer asking him to assemble a computer.
Working at only 30 days of credit, it dût address the assembly and the delivery of aircraft finished.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties in developing a computer mouse.
“ I remember big disputes … I cried over by claiming that it would take five years [to manufacture a mouse which would cost $300] I have had enough, I left and went to see a designer. ”
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that proves incredibly reliable.
On the big corporations that steam:
Well before it is revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders were wrong and losing control of their market share.
“ Admettons that you work for IBM or Xerox, you are a better copier and printer or better, after? ”
You have the monopoly on the market, so the company does not have more success.
Sales and marketing can move it forward, so this [are] these types of people who run the companies and staff dedicated product are put on the “ gap for decisions.
The genius in product that has led to this monopoly position is very rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product from a bad product – the manual work required.
That is what happened at Xerox …
Xerox could hold all the computer industry.
It could be ten times its current size. Xerox have been the Microsoft in the 1990s …
They have scored the defeat to the victory.
On innovation as artistic form:
“ A huge part of manual work separates a clever idea of a product exceptional … as you develop this idea, changing and growing. ”
You learn a lot about its intricacies.
There are compromises to be … some things you can do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, factories as well.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) in assembling it to each other.
Finally, the decisions are taken by personal taste. it is to try to give you the best products that men have created, and try to make these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that the good artists copy and that the great artists steal.
We have always ashamed to fly from excellent ideas.
It is partly what makes Macintosh. exceptional people who worked on were musicians, poets, zoologistes, historians, which simply proved the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for the computer science, they would have done an excellent job in another area.
Scalia and Thomas dînent with opponents of the law of health while the court meets
When the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to discuss the issue of contention policy, whether the opposition to the law of President Obama 's health will be heard, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and finally there is Clarence Thomas, have been noticed at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who defend the case before the high court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges are gathered for a conference to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases in question was a case brought by 26 states challenging the health care reform ambitious passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for activists conservatives at the national level.
The justices agreed to hear the complaint, in effect, an argument of monumental 5h30 is expected in March, and the result will probably be conducive to the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which is growing at a time when the Court 's decision will be made.
The lawyer, which will take place before the court and argue with the rejection of the law, will probably be Paul Clement, who served as general (CEAS) of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of sleeping, Bancroft PLLC, was part of two dozen surgeries that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the League Fédéraliste (Federalist Society), a group of long - standing dedicated to defending the legal principles conservatives.
Another cabinet which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that have challenged the law, the National Federation of independent businesses (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another developer has been the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the conference of the court on the case.
If it was, among others, Mitch McConnell, America 'top Republican Senate and opponent said of the health law.
The star guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of conduct.
In fact, the judges are exempt from code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they argumenteraient probably by the code of Canon 4C, which reads: “ a judge can attend fund - raising organisations linked to the law and others of that the judge could not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or on the programme of such an event. ”
However, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the firms of the case, as well as to a company with a financial interest massive, was enough to alarm the activists in government ethics.
“ This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court must play by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges, ” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“ The judges and drank dînaient and a fundraising of night with lawyers who have cases pending before the court. ”
Their presence and their participation in the fundraising event of this dismantled any demand fairness and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics claiming that they mix too easily the affairs of the court with the agenda of groups such as the League Fédéraliste.
And Thomas' s wife, Ginni, is a conservative activist of high - profile.
Moreover, conservatives argue that it is the judge who Elena Kagan has an ethical problem, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was (CEAS) general of the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law have been attributed to the trial court.
His critics have lobbied for Kagan is opposed to hear the case, saying it was too invested in defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that it would.
Boeing has orders for a record $18 billion for planes
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 planes, bi - corridors, with the opportunity to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
It is not unusual for a company to receive an order looking 50 of its products.
This is a case where the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft, and that the amount of these 50 reached the record sum of $18 billion.
Equally astonishing is that Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a gold mine growing future orders for aircraft.
In forecasts published Monday, the Chicago company believes that the airlines in the Middle East will need in the next 20 years of 2 520 planes worth a total of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing has informed of the order of commercial aircraft, the most expensive in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi - corridors.
This is the Emirates airline based in Dubai, which has spent this command ostentatious.
Boeing announced at the Salon Aéronautique Dubai of 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 planes more, which would raise the total amount of orders to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that the company Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787 - 8, dubbed Dreamliners, a model who boasts of significant fuel savings and convenience for passengers.
The amount of these six devices is “ more than a billion dollars.
“ This is clearly a very positive for Boeing, ” said Neal Act Dihora, analyst at Morningstar.
“ These clients in particular have a huge value. ”
In the Middle East, oil - producing countries have much of their airlines.
So they are not just the means to pay these aircraft, but a rise in the price of fuel - usual damaging for airlines because it is their most important - do they not be harmful if since the country gained money with the rise in oil prices.
This is important because these companies are less likely than others to cancel or postpone their orders for aircraft when the oil price increases, said Dihora.
“ They have a risk coverage in natural, ” he said.
The order from Emirates strengthens the predominance of Boeing in the market for large aircraft - carriers and aid to attempt to curb the encroachment of the plane with his competitor Airbus A350.
The victory for Boeing in Room aeronautics comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the start of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777 - 300ER.
Airbus is pushing its beginnings to increase the pressure following the demand for its clients to increase its carrying capacity and its autonomy.
The actions of the company Boeing have increased by 1.5% to achieve the 67,94 dollars.
The sister of the mexican president obviously fought the election of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon says that drug traffickers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo the PRI in the race to the post of governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost its bid for access to the office of Governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers have helped one of his opponents.
The early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo 's Institutionnel Revolutionary Party, or PRI, were at the forefront of the race for the post of governor of this state in the west.
“ The intervention of organised crime during the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarmingly, not only for the Michoacán but for the entire country, ” said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio in an interview Monday following the elections.
“ They have threatened our candidates, our electoral … they have taken hold in the polls, has installed roadblocks … and have forced people to vote for the PRI. ”
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until “ to lose the presidency in 2000.
But it held its return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to be outspoken of little Calderon, who was leading in the polls before the day of the election.
Calderon, Conservative Party candidate of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, has refused to recognise Vallejo as winner.
Silvano Aureoles, candidate leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently holds the post of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential left for this divided and unhappy.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the “ state, has denied any connection with the drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by the drug cartels in the trafficking of marihuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the “ home state of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A week before the elections a PAN mayor was murdered when he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have abandoned locally to the campaign of fear.
However, for the PRI, so corrupt that the elections of Michoacán seem, a victory will help the party in its tracks.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, “ I think this victory is very encouraging for next year. ”
The BASD urge Asia to help the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has asked to India and China to prepare to help the eurozone out of its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a fall in the long term to prevent the development of the “ asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the director general of the BASD based in Manila, has said that the two economic powers in the world 's fastest growing “ should do everything in their power to accelerate the recovery of the currency zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised against the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the problems of Europe to a “ indifferent eye ” and indicated that a financial support asian alongside the leaders and resources of Europe would “ avoid a collapse of the long - term global economy. ”
“ We are all together in this crisis. ”
“ Therefore, anyone can help Europe out of the crisis is useful, ” he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“ Asia can be protected, up to a point, but it is not immune. ”
“ Well, if China and India can help, that nothing prevents them from. ”
In recent months, the eurozone has been seriously damaged by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of borrowing italian is dangerously skyrocketed and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The flourishing of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe has been spread fear that the “ global economy falls into recession, and has prompted the appeal of major emerging economies to meet to help the eurozone to find a solution.
Mr Nag has appeared that the IMF carrying any aid asian, but he has also said that the bilateral assistance, such as buying bonds of financial rescue funds from the United States, the European Financial Stability Facility - offered greater power of negotiations to asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Minister of Trade and Industry Indian, said that “ India will do everything they can ” to help the euro zone since its own economy is suffering a drop in exports and a freezing of inflows of foreign capital.
“ Nobody wants the euro zone remains unstable and turbulent, ” he said.
“ We have to face monumental challenges and we must maintain a high level of growth. ”
“ This is not a choice, this is an imperative, because where we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women? ”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans when they face their own significant economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to accept an aid to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, including at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less.
“ One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years and they go on holiday in the sun, and they will be hard to swallow, ” he said.
Lee Howell, the chairman of the World Economic Forum, has also asked why the reserves of India should be used to keep many greek officials in well - paid jobs mismanaged that generate losses, as in the rail industry.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis could cause “ significant repercussions ” across Asia.
The forecasts of the BASD of economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011 / 2012 face now “ downside risks ” because of the threat.
He pointed out that the emerging markets vulnerable needed to “ develop “ bailouts ” against an economic downturn and significant capital flight.
Severe warnings from the Pentagon on the potential of the defence cuts
The defense secretary, Leon Panetta, has increased the pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. triggered a chain reaction of financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, via gatherings of civilians.
The Pentagon digests already $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears that an additional sum of $600 or more cuts be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“ The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry, ” Panetta said in a letter to the Sénateurs John McCain, R - Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R - South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called the sequestration, would lead to 23% of cuts and the freezing of many new projects.
“ A reduction as important, applied and indiscriminately, make the most of our vessels and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building, and significantly harm other efforts to modernize, ” Panetta wrote to senators.
“ We would also be forced to separate us from a number of our civilian personnel, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the goal. ”
“ These changes ébranleraient faith of those who support our military and endommageraient seriously our preparation. ”
The cuts affect possibly troops fighting continues, Panetta.
“ Although the funding in wartime accounts of contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war efforts would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the budgets of basis, ” warned Panetta.
“ The staff contractor would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contract that support the war. ”
“ The staff managing the wages would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to providers of war, and the support legal and policy would be disrupted. ”
The two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
“ The consequence of a storage on the Department of Defense would spark a rapid decline of the United States as a leader of the undisputed global military power. ”
“ We are opposed to any such drastic action, ” the senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon at the time of the publication of the letter to Panetta.
“ This is not a result with which we can live, and is certainly not what we should impose on us. ”
“ The sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen. ”
The letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of senators are increasing the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about cuts possible, even if he got himself at the highest post Pentagon uniting years of expertise in the budget to Congress and the White House and knowing that it was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Secretary has painted a bleak picture of what could happen - a military with a shell, but no core.
“ This is a ship without sailors. ”
“ This is a squad without bullets. ”
“ This is a fighter plane, without enough trained pilot. ”
“ This is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission, ” said Panetta during his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
“ This is a force depressed, poorly prepared and incapable of facing potential adversaries. ”
“ De facto, it invites aggression. ”
In an addendum to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta announced specifically how new cuts “ could generate huge operational risks: delayed response to crises and conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk assumed combat operations in the future. ”
And Panetta has said that some of the biggest projects defence could move into the sunset, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
The list included the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned, the submarine ballistic of new generation, the new ship combat coastline and the new vehicle of ground, which would replace the Humvee Army and Navy.
Stop the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that it is an essential step to improve and to respond to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A glance at the headlines recent indicates how deception and lies are ubiquitous in everyday life.
The republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
The trustees of Penn State have been accused of perjury for allegedly covered reports that a football coach at retirement has sexual assaults on boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been taken by an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsé countries.
The member of Congress from New York and celebrity Internet Anthony Weiner, has gone for a fool of denials by issuing quickly contradicted by incontrovertible proof.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violations of campaign - finance - related coverage of an.
And then, none of those who lived history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton has triggered by lying during his second term on ​​son sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating the tests in school and university are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given the answers on tests pupils to be much to see on their evaluations of performance.
The mentors who should teach the contrary to send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many deception encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are lies.
Another study showed that foreigners are lying on three occasions in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting and identifying lies is a key competence that everyone must acquire, both personal and professional.
Far from being a game similar to, say, charades, where the aim is to be who said: “ I have had, ” the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities have conducted a thorough search of such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that myths older on lies have been démystifiés.
The liars look you in the eye.
They do bégayent rougissent, or does not always wave.
Do not conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to catch.
A lie detector called can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, micro - facial expressions, the formation of the issue and the response time.
I spent several years to examine the scientific results in the vast body of knowledge and always emerge on deceit, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern power that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, the interviews, the negotiation or management.
The good liars are adept at well read others, making them comfortable, by managing their own emotions and intuitively sensing how others perceive them.
We know from research that extravertis lying more than the introvertis, men say more lies “ focused on them, ” while women say more lies, focused on “ the other ” — usually to protect the feelings of someone – that people married less often lie to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a mécréant, the rest will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone lying?
First of all, the look of your normal behaviour.
This is what we call “ establish the data points of reference. ”
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring further changes.
Look at the shape of your subject, the laughter, the quality.
You need to know if someone is stirring normally its feet constantly in order not to launch the perfidious when you see stirring the feet in the middle of the meeting.
And then looking for clues of behaviour misleading verbal and non - verbal.
Consider these indices as red flags, not evidence of deception.
People misleading can overpower the high body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet toward the door, look for an exit, change of position significantly or submit a relief “ post - interview ” - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of position when all the difficult questions are past.
The interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is over right to seek to ignite the reaction post - interview.
Also, be careful the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson has been derailed by using the past while claiming that his wife murdered was alive, triggering a national research to regain it.
Individuals can also use a misleading language outpaced: “ I did not have sexual relations with that woman … Miss Lewinsky ” or repeat entirely a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Can someone using a lot of “ hangover ” in its response to a difficult question: “ well … to tell the truth … if I remember goods … to my knowledge. ”
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and often is a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to recognise the deception is possible.
These skills improve the chances of anyone to prevent victimisation by hustlers in their professional and personal life.
The controversial pipeline will be defeated after the threat of late approval of the United States
A few days after that, the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - provoking the wrath of the unions while appeasing environmentalists, seeking to build the pipeline said that it is ready to redirect the project for the restart.
TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the pipeline planned outside the environmentally sensitive area of the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win his approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference on Capitol Hill of Nebraska.
The official of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, says that the company remains confident that it will eventually get the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to award a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid areas of dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a massive underground water sources.
“ This is a real way forward, ” says Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska to Fox News.
The new review of environmental commissioned by the State Department probably would have delayed any decision until 2013, after next year 's election, although officials deny the involvement of politics in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and he expressed his support.
The 2,735 km pipeline stretching from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It may be carrying 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, he should go through six states.
It is loathed by environmentalists, but liked by working groups, who have depended on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But the Nebraska lawmakers opposed to this plan are pushing a bill to force the remoteness of the region 's Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The study of environmental impact in the State Department found that the project would pose only negative environmental impacts limited, but the energy industry has said that the inspector general of the department has ordered an investigation of a separate review process, focused on two questions.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest in the programme.
The other is whether a company that has been embauchée to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice by its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly caused a young child sections of fear
A family of New York says that the diva Patti LaBelle Disco launched in a spate of violence in the hall of their building in Manhattan, has terrified their little girl to the point where it has spewed out of fear.
The tirade of the singer “ Lady Marmalade ” spooked the small Geneviève Monk aged 18 months, until she suffered “ changes in personality, sleep disorders ” and “ the increased fear of foreigners, ” said his family during the trial of the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
This was the 10 November last year while the technician stage Kevin Monk, his wife of teaching kindergarten children, Roseanna, Geneviève and is willing to go to visit family.

Adversity climate has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa unemployment and informalité have increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy contracted
2011 is the year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self - called the change, which has generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the adversity climate at the beginning of the year, the rise is not, as there is a deterioration of the key indicators of economic development.
Temperatures low in February, part of causing losses of doubling in the agricultural sector, have limited the ability of the economy to the state for growth, caused a contraction in economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic reduction of 31,16 percent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of spending by the frozen out by the Council Mexicain Development Rurale Soutenable, there has been damage to 582 835 million hectares, of which a 78,03 percent have suffered damage total and the rest of 21,07 percent have suffered damage partial, the main crops affected were the vegetables, corn and peas kid.
The drop in economic activity has generated until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistique Géographie and the unemployment rate in the state during the first three quarters of the year we noticed a rise accelerated, because while the January to March 55 thousand 053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4,53 percent of the population economic active, in the second quarter the rate has become 5,28 percent and the July to September, the average has continued to increase until 6,19 percent, a rate that is more than 74 thousand sinaloens unemployed, an increase over the first half of 18 969 thousand people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is one - factor, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Science of Faculdade de Économiques and not the UAS, rising unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions undertaken by the public policy.
“ What we see is a rise in unemployment which is due to a variety of factors, among whom the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn them $illegal in a way that is not easy because they work for the win, they invest them and use them in something, ” he said.
Migration detained
López Cervantes said that rising unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
“ The number of people who have fled the state to go to work abroad, USA has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly by entering because they have already struggling to find work, these people are here and asking the sources of their work, which means that unemployment is rising, ” said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labour market sinaloen worsens in considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates among the working conditions, according to the INEGI 60,38, the percent of the population involved in this state is working without pay as worker at any institution social insurance.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason gap in the state are the low wages, the body has the lowest of the country, according to the records of the institute Mexicain of insurance and not the Secretary of Labor and Social Prévision.
The monthly income means workers sinaloens was, until September 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, which stands at 7 451 thousand pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Part of the drop in economic activity and rising unemployment, in 2011 we recorded the largest reduction in investment Étranger Direct of the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of economy from January to June the FDI state has reached 630 697 thousand dollars, which represents a drop of 87.74 percent compared to 5 thousand dollars 312 143 million recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat of economic development of the state government for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by the companies of the service sector.
Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the state government has requested in July in Congress public approval of a loan of $3 trillion pesos, for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipes, with the aim to boost the economy, the approval of Congress of the state has been to 2,600 trillion pesos and until November it has seen no benefit of debt in any sector of the economy of the state.
Reactions
For the representatives of the sector employers, the first year of government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of capacity management of government.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the House 's national industry for transformation, said that in 2011 there has not been a harmonization of the wishes of the various sectors, which included the state government.
“ The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year was really very poor, working hard to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012, we need to double our effort, it took align the effort and the right way already timed to this new team of government, hope that next year will be a lot better, ” he said.
Slow economic
Loredo López said that events such as the frozen at the beginning of the year have focused the state 's economy and restricted his performance and growth.
“ The low fluxe economic product of several events, among whom the frosts, one of the main impact has been a slow economy which is quickly enough to generate an economic dynamism which allows an acceptable level e flows in the trial, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we shut much below the expectations we had, ” he said.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the employers' confederation of the Republic of Mexico 's Sinaloa has said that we want to channel the state to productive activities more dynamism.
“ In general terms we have observed that it has worked, we feel that it is necessary to develop a long - term programme which redefined the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we détone all the potential of the material and human resources Sinaloa ”, he says.
A lot to do
The chairman of the Coparmex has emphasised the importance of establishing a vision of the future that channels better government efforts.
“ In general terms, I would say that the government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there is some advances, but it is important to develop a programma to long term, ” he said.
He pointed out that the current administration has shown advances in the management of public policy.
“ There are elements that allow us to say that the government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked hard and the government is aware of the fact that there is still much to do, ” he said.
Sentenced to 8 kilograms of marihuana

Debts to the contributions to the books
The works of social contemplés in programmes like Hábitat, Rescate of Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrant may not be finished when recording of serious delays due to a lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of Social Development municipal indicated that although until now the building programmes have progressed, they find themselves in a situation of risk, because the state government is has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed the 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, which the state must provide the 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipe have provided resources for the books, so there is the possibility of a delay in their final stages.
“ They must provide a contribution of 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon end they do we have anything since July, even if they had given us part, ” he says, “ and we, to register no delays, we started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money. ”
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid the contributions correspondents, therefore at the beginning of the administration the municipe had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the administration of the state had not provided on this occasion.
“ We had already been through this period in the previous sexennal because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and programs continue to operate and this year we, in order to be able to access these programs, we have duu get the resources to cover what the state had not paid, ” détailla there.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the authorities of the state to provide these resources, he said that they had been asked by the secretary of administration and finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management for the percentages corresponding arrive as soon as possible.
“ They must provide almost 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they did nothing. ”
The Court validates the power outage “ analog ” in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of signales analogue for the digital currency is a more important that the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has rejected arguments that the constitutional Senat and the Chamber of Deputies made against the presidential decree that advance the so - called “ blackout ” of analogue 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to overturn have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, which included the chairman of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, has seen that President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded her powers when he issued the decree that details the actions to follow to ensure the transition to digital tv land.
With this result, the controversial constitutional promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was itself thwarted for not meeting the qualified majority of eight votes for the court to rule on the constitutionality of the decree or non - constitutionality, and it continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, produced by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, has proposed the statement of the decree as non - constitutional, due to the fact that the regulation of radio and television is an allocation reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of subordination hierarchical and reserve of law.
To the project have voted only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna for Sánchez and Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two controversial constitutional and contest the decree, acknowledging the complaints, the minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions of these for the digital transition.
The plenary session of ministers has solved débouter also the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project with the minister Sánchez Cordero is also to blame.
In his speech, the president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards for the measures that the public administration is preparing.
“ I do believe that if he did it affect the autonomy of the regulatory body ”, and he pointed out that the planning of public policy in strategic areas such as the telecoms sector is the responsibility of the federal Commission, which has constitutional mandate for the direction of the state.
The substitution of signales analogue by signales digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered the last years and this is reflected in a better use of radio spectrum, improved quality of signal and more channels.
Postponing the change, has supported it would postpone the benefits of the digitalisation which involves a decision of public interest has not just a technical dimension, “ because it also includes questions of economic, social, political and national security. ”
These issues, said, “ require the operation of a whole system, according to the principle of economic direction of the state, including a group of powers that the Constitution grants at the Faculty of Executive of the state ”.
He pointed out that a large number of countries around the world have already finished the digital transition and they did through Executive, despite the fact that they had the technical bodies strong specialist.
We cannot conclude that the Executive, by issuing the decree challenged, has invaded a form sphere of responsibility of Congress, because it ensures the administrative sphere in compliance with laws made by the Législative, assura there.
The analysis of the possibility of a vote by counting “ vote ” in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election for governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 minutes total.
The possibility of the count “ vote by vote ” is a reality on the trial election this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the programme Résultats Électoraux Préliminaires (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the election for governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 6 thousand 74 minutes total.
In this sense, the chairman of the General Council of the Institute of Michoacán Électoral (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past 9 November, the electoral body has approved a series of guidelines to harmonise standards to the local - federal electoral.
We remember that Michoacán has not approved nor its constitution politics or its Code Électoral state or the law of Justice Électorale, at the same time as the Congress of the state approved the reforms little before that would end the legal deadline for this trial electoral can enter into force and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has neglected its publication in the deadline set by the law of Official Journal of the state, with the argument that he had a few objections.
The same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has resolved the controversial constitutional promoted by the legislative power local and described as “ invalid and illegal ” the vote of the trustee of the state for constitutional reforms, because it does not have the right to “ punish or attack. ”
Interviewed on the possibility of the “ vote by vote, ” María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that with the approval of the relevant guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to make the count biased and total votes by the body local election.
Thus, the counting of votes, part of one or several packages election, it may be that: the results of minutes will coincide; there is no minutes ballots and tally in the file of the box is not among the President of it; or there are errors or obvious alterations of minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all polls of the election can be done when there is evidence of the fact that the difference between the supposed candidate win the election and the respective who won second place in the poll is equal to or below by one percentage point; if that at the beginning of the session is a petition the representative of the party and / or coalition which has presented the second candidates reported.
The running total of ballot can also be achieved if at the end of the count common it emerges that the difference between the candidate expected to win and the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the petition the representative of the political party with the candidate came second, in which case we exclude the electoral packages that were subject of partial count.
It must be said that this is the situation with the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of 923 minutes total.

The new italian government be formed Wednesday
The prime minister - designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that brought the country to the brink of economic disaster
The prime minister - designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the president of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic ruin and endangered the whole area.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, were to meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form the government.
It is expected that he presents a cabinet composed in its majorities by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume his post.
Monti has said he will present the president the result of his conversations with the political parties in his essay to form a government.
“ I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country to overcome this difficult phase, ” said the former European Commissioner for journalists.
Monti has not said explicitly that it could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that those hurdles have been overcome.
“ The framework is now well route, ” he added.
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, with smaller than normal, while Italy fight a political and financial crisis that pushed the cost of its debt at levels impossible to support.
The new government led by former European Commissioner Mario Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by european leaders to restore confidence in Italy, which had been affected.
Highlighting the pressure on Monti to dispatch, market volatility to placed bond yields on 10 - year italian BTP above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland have duu be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of the Confindustria employers italian, told the media after his meeting with Monti: “ we said that we would support a lot this government ”.
We believe that this government is the last opportunity for Italy to this kind of emergency.
The chances of success of Monti has been greatly encouraged by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, which the crisis has forced to resign on Saturday past.
“ We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result, ” said to the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center - right.
The support of the italian PDL party, the biggest, is significant because until now many of its members were opposed to the government 's majority technocrat that Monti form.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to apply what probably will be unpopular austerity reforms.
All block or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack in financial markets.
The Italian Association of benches foreign has added to the pressure by remarking that bankruptcy Monti would be a disaster.
Monti has begun Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and organisations and young women.
He will end his tour of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who has a power transition very quickly in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the cost of italian debt are now back to critical levels between the uncertainty on the success of the new prime minister.
Save Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, this would be too much for the current financial defences of area.
Monti has said that his government will persist until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions on the fact that politicians only give him time to implement the reforms before making the elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be formed only by specialists, an index of their objections before a process required by the financial pressure.
Political sources have indicated that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the test to include political figures.

They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group holds that for them, this will also be a dream come true to occur in this country.
It is that the bassiste and founding member Jeff Ament has assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, of Brazil, last week.
The group is in the wing of his south american tour to celebrate two steeply to work and Sunday 20 will do its single stopover in Central America.
That day will arise on the national stage, from 7: 30 p. m., next to the group of Los Angeles The X and the national Las Robertas.
This is part of the conversation, which the full transcript is in La Nación on the Internet.
For its followers costariciens, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. do you know what your fans live?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality for us too.
It is the second time in South America and Central and so far has been stellar.
I have spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is a country so beautiful and I think that we can spend a few days.
We therefore émotionne to wear our music there.
I ask you, because it has a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with the intensity days earlier.
What is your message to your most ardent followers?
Thank you to remain alongside us for all these years.
We have taken 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we are sorry because so much time has had to spend up to this concert.
Some people are already saying that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does that adds a bit of pressure on your visit.
Some of the biggest shows that we have offered for the last 21 years took place over the last two weeks.
We have offered a two shows huge in Sao Paolo and we hope that this will put us in form for this concert to Costa Rica.
We are very keen to produce.
We love this country, we like to make the surfing and jungle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best country in the world.
How did you discovered Costa Rica and its waves to make the surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends would always make the surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, with Mexico, are great places to make the surfing, as we learned, through the gents who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you with offered shows huge, with great songs.
What do you have planned for your presentation to Costa Rica?
As we have never produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs of each album and give our fans a good repertoire and diverse.
You will never repeat the repertoire.
What is it?
I believe this is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everyone likes of different songs, which is why it is very difficult to choose what songs interpret every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the script that we no longer have interpreted for a very long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprise us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and that we can have forgotten.
This means that the show is more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, it is difficult to believe everything you have succeeded?
Yes, absolutely.
First, I believe that none of us imagined that we would form a large rock group, and the fact that we did for more than 20 years is that it looks like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together we émotionne much.
We love and we worship create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go.
Things could only get better for us.
That means for you to have been a key element in the creation of the grunge?
It was always an honour for us to form part of this group of large groups.
We are great friends with people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
This is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group created a city, but is much more strange when five or ten outside groups at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to form part of the group of Seattle.
We play again with some of them from time to time.
Last year we had a festival with Alice in Chains and we have been in Canada with Mudhoney, we have seen to Soundgarden in their tour, so we are lucky to still be friends with them all and it is an honor for us to form part of this sound of Seattle, which has occurred.
It is also very strange that a group like the your remains united and with the same people for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has joined 13 years ago, and only this is much more time than many groups have normally.
First, I think we are lucky to be alive and, secondly, we are all concerned for the other.
We are all friends intimate and through this there are avenues music that gives the freedom to experiment.
We have to trust each other with the music of everyone and it could only get better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you can do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into the hands of big and hordes of people who love your music.
If we do not forget that people are there to music, that help us to remember that we must respect the music and which has made, without realise that being famous and a rock star, which is not interested in any of us.
How you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we have good writing songs and the beginning has been stellar.
We have been a group for almost three years and we have not published a record before the death of Andy (Andrew Bretton).
There has been a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important thing is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which began in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo I think the incredible person that Andy was and how he laughed, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and a lot of other things with him.
It was a surprising and we lack.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show to Costa Rica.
It is true that you are familiar with his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you have chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production has sent videos with various proposals and that has been the group that we would have liked the more, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer in direct and this must be very entertaining.
For what you always changing the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
It was he who sings and I think we did it with the first words that he imagines.
As bassiste, what are his influences?
There are so many of them …
Among the first which I remember there are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski …
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon on bassistes that I love.
How has succeeded Pearl Jam has keep levering the grunge despite the fact that it is more fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, this reminds me of the groups that I mentioned, as Mudhoney, Nirvana and Soundgarden, all those that have occurred at the same time and, if it is operating now, I think this is wonderful because that is a music that is worth listening to, and groups like Mudhoney are now the best music than ever.
At the start, his music had a more obscure, and now it has become more positive.
What has this change?
This is interesting, because I think there are some songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also some songs, as the end but Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even if they might sound a little positive.
With the two, when Ed has played for me, I wept when I have listened to them and they are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you demeans and there is a trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things are starting to influence your tone art and music and these songs, undoubtedly, is that for me.
I also think that you can also be happy and even as it can make music obscure.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presented in the forward, has informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed during his government (1990 - 2000) suffers from various ailments, which included a language of cancer for which he was operated four times and is now under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, said on Canal N television that Fujimori will be assessed for three days in the National Institute of diseases néoplasiques to determine the cause of the pain and loss of power in its lower.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the restoration of the death penalty for humanitarian reasons, without doubt, he said that he will like it because it feels innocent.
Four times he was operated on for cancer of language, it has a weight loss of weight in kilograms, 18, and other diseases, as a gastrite érosive severe, a kyste of pancréas, kidney stones, blood pressure and traffic problems in the feet, has listed the doctor.
Fujimori is serving the sentence since September 2007 in the direction of national Opérations Spéciales police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of a squad of annihilation of the army, which has operated illegally during the early years of his government.
Mujica trip to Mexico to consolidate the political ties
A motorcade official, who heads the Uruguayan President José Mujica and formed of various ministers and bosses, launch Tuesday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and address the political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday and his mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political authorities, trade and a meeting with the community of comparative residents in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by uruguayan presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be “ good for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations, ” according to information published by the presidency of the latin american country on its web page.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France, which took place when the agent of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, includes the latin american country on the list of tax havens in the G - 20 meeting in the french city of Cannes.
In his speech, Mr Sarkozy has threatened to exclude from the international community the countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that caused the rejection of Uruguay and appeal to its ambassador for consultations this european country.
Mexico since the November G20 chair, a group comprised of emerging and developed stronger in the world, and has in place with the latin american country, since January this year, a convention to exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to dispatch the achievements of the exchange tax out of the “ gri list ” of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries which implémentent not all international standards of cooperation on tax matters.
Commercially, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Treaty of Free Trade (TLC) who has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The plumber moustachu happening in with “ Super Mario 3D Land ” 3d
Super Mario has fought, indefatigable, for 25 years to save to Princess Peach from the clutches of villain Bowser, but it had never been done in three dimensions: in “ Super Mario Land 3d ” will contend for the love of the young technology stéréoscopique.
The title, which happens this month to stores around the world, was designed from the start to fully exploit the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS mobile games console, which allows us to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“ Mario is the man who must say as must operate the stéréoscopie without glasses, ” said the head of news specialist Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that 3d “ Super Mario Land ” is “ the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for this support ”, because until now of success as “ Star Fox 64 3d ” or “ Zelda: Ocarine of time 3d ” was adaptations of existing securities.
The spokesman for Nintendo has argued that, in spite of being in 3d, “ Super Mario Land ” is a 3d video game “ accessible ” which allows some fast and fluid.
Alvarez said that “ Super Mario Land 3d ” contains two games in one: the first part is “ simple ” for sticking users less nimble.
Once developed, most experts can make a “ second round ” levels of the game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users can choose to real time between a D or an “ aggressive ” which only affects the depth of the action, but that would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the various challenges and “ not succumb to optical illusions. ”
The incursion of Super Mario in three dimensions also demands the return of the personality of a games console and mobile, a fact that is happening more since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo is a nod to the followers of the saga and repeat the formula for success of previous games, which is in the fact that the plumber moustachu must go platforms corroded of perils for free to Princess Peach.
Even if I find new player in the movement, the environments, costumes and enemies, and also in the case of Luigi “ feasible ”.
Colom gives his blessing to the extradition of Portillo in the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday the past that he gave the order to extradite the former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy to laundering $70 million Americans.
Thus ends on trial for Guatemala meets at the request of the country 's north who requested Portillo to the judge.
At a press conference, Colom said that its decision follows the independence of the judiciary and executive taking into account the fact that a trial court had already ordered his extradition.
He said that during his term “ he had not helped ” in any judicial resolution and gave way to all types that he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did assume an executive after exhausting judicial bodies and constitutional to judge the former trustee of the period 2004 - 2004.
According to the resolutions of the 5th Criminal Court, and the Court of Constitutionalité (CT), Portillo should be extradited after having solved his legal situation in Guatemala and having secured their human rights.
Portillo was absolute for embezzlement of Q120 million at the Ministry of Defence when he was president, who was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry has appealed and has revived the case.
Trinijove has helped young 6000 at risk
The body is born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The results of the first 25 years to life for the body of social support Trinijove is important: 6000 young people at risk of exclusion have received assistance to overcome a difficult situation for a quarter of a century.
Added to that is the long centennial of jobs moment in this social group.
The anniversary has served yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex Fabra i Coats which over 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the goal of helping people poorly trained, without work, with problems of addiction or marginalised.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu has focused a lot of responsible entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral season, showed the unitary nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Alongside the president of the Regional Catalan government (stretch), Artur Mas, and his predecessor, Mr Pujol, attended the act, the former minister of education Socialist, Ernest Maragall and the former mayor deputy mayor and current councillor eco - socialist Ricard Goma.
Have also seen in the great hall Fabra i Coats the current minister of Well - being Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the director of the charity, Caixa Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current is too, but he added that the work done so far is “ a good basis ”.
The President gave Trinijove as example to fight the wrong circumstances and to give people hope in difficulty.
“ The crisis is not something new to the entity and to the work that it does, ” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro - festive, evacuated
The invaders were appropriate for 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, to Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants have abandoned the property at midday yesterday without any resistance
It seems likely that the nightmare that the residents of the number of 51 Rue Balmes lived ended.
Twelve people have abandoned at midday yesterday voluntarily the building where they were illegally and where they held micro - festive despairing, which neighbors by judicial order and without the need for intervention by the police.
At the end of the operation has changed the lock on the door to prevent the situation repeats itself.
“ From this day there will be an access control, ” affirmât administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of 13 apartments in the building, the rest were motivated, has won the installation of electric and water, in part to paint the walls and allow the residues of any kind, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of celebrations masses, which lasted until two days and despairing tenants.
Alongside the building there is a disco Balmes, 51, who was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that once occupied the building his case has fallen an 80%.
The owner of the disco mentioned that the invaders Property him were the competence unfair, because they were selling glasses to three euros, while in the disco they were 10.
In addition, the owner of the local leisure had to respond to complaints from neighbours for noise, while, according to it, the problems were not caused by customers of the disco, but by the people of the occupied home and above all the participants in the celebrations there, who were more frequent and more intense over the past weeks, according to neighbors irked area.
The head of the disco explained that the problems were so large that it has reached an agreement with the owner of the property and it is nine months that it would “ forgive ” rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) has also confirmed that the last few weeks they received more complaints from neighbours for this situation.
The chairman of the City of the PP 's City Hall, Alberto Díaz Fernández, had asked for the past week “ the immediate evacuation of the building to overcome the problems of life in common and civic pride that he turned to residents and the degradation of the zone. ”
The popular leader said that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but the last few months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and in some apartments there has been flying too.
It is in this sense that he added that “ we must put an end to impunity and be implacable against the antisocial behaviour generated in the property. ”
Yesterday, the Mossos (the local police Catalan) has cleared a building at Nou Barris.
15.30 hours at the police moved to the number of 35 Rue Mont - ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people gained access to the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide with the opportunity to convene beyond the controversy on fees
The municipal contests on the 16 doors opened up the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid - 1980s, in the height of the already - dead Corporation Métropolitaine of Barcelona (CMB), this administration has printed a chart of promoting Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great fleet of the Barcelona metropolitan.
It also contained a comparison that figures with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become again, in the imagination of many people, the higher limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that will not move on the north - south axis, otherwise high - low mountains () ().
The qualification of Collserola as natural park is for the benefit of this idea.
The reference was more Central Park otherwise Yellowstone, with widespread in the role of the Yogi Bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the council has convened a mega - competition composed by 16 competitions for all the doors of access to Collserola.
A door calls to the idea of park, no doubt.
It is this, or someone wants to put the doors to the field.
The question seemed alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The contest, both in terms of its organisation as regards the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation in all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurrent theme that two members of the ancient caste of elected officials are talking about when they recognise themselves in a lift.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who have been presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is good.
For Roldán, after addressing the front coastal “ it is necessary to “ discuss ” on the front of mountain ” because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, blocks away from houses green has not been brought to an end.
“ It is based on the basis that the park more extended to Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for his great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, ” has given the verdict the architect for which the title of “ doors of Collserola ” contains a “ trap ” lexicon: we must think of them as “ the access to a park, but the demarcation of some areas where we need to act. ”
Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as “ intellectual challenge ” with “ some perils. ”
The dangers that arise from “ the uncertainty of the projection of public space ” after the experience in the 1980s and has had in the area of the Forum of his song “ swan ”.
The first fear is the very definition of borders on which you can build.
“ Limiting something already means making the next step ”, that is to say, its lane.
“ We need to think about new instruments, urban planning, because the current [in reference to Plan General Métropolitain (PGM)] can cause real disasters. ”
Being more to the question, Modol opinion that, simplifying, the aspect of the region of El Valles Collserola “ can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not ”.
Modol reminds us that there is already a work done by employers to Collserola who “ must not be lost, ” in thanks for the opportunity that City Hall offer its corporation to intervene in this project, “ from the first moment. ”
In addition, he wants the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe - led that allows architects to enter the debate, but “ doubt ” if this looming technical must lead the multidisciplinary teams (“ a success ”, he says) that is create: “ we, the architects, should be just an instrument. ”
Bayona hinted that the answer to the question that gives the title of the piece is complicated because of the foundations of the contest it lacks a comprehensive view of Collserola: “ it has convened 16 contests horizontal - said - it - in the mountains, but there is not a reading longitudinale which path and understands the area as a whole. ”
This is, in this case at least, that it has chosen to participate in 16 contests.
In a different way, a project for that one of the doors can shock in the programme and definition of the architect of the door neighbour.
In his opinion, yes, the council should ensure that the immediate superior to that of Ronda to Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that has made a smooth transition between the city and the Green.
Casino to forgive Jonás Larrazábal and it will be freed
After 72 days of arrest, the provisional plenipotentiary of legal casino Red gave the forgiveness from the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in the trial started against him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years arrested, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the merits of the legal power of the casino Red grant forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the casino Royal, the owner of the casino, Gil Red Sergio García, has published a series of photos and videos in which présumément Manuel Jonás called him the payment of a quotte economic for the mayor of Monterrey allows the functioning of the illegal gambling den.
After the public denunciation, the public prosecutor has opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor PANiste and on 2 September it was arrested and held in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before Agent for the Ministry of Public 3 Délits Patrimoniaux, he was transferred to the Centre of Détention 1, located in the Old Quartier of the state capital.
He stayed there for the 49 days following when he gave a second detention order after the agent of the Public Ministry has undercut the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October it was moved to the centre of criminal Cadereyta présumément for singing with one and a half million pesos, the owners of the casino Red; but it has only spent a few hours in the detention centre average security because there were death threats against him.
The authorities have allowed him to continue the trial inward - looking into the cells municipal San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October an order to capture has been issued by the clerk of the Second District Court of Criminal, Jorge Yánez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation confirmed there was sufficient evidence to determine guilt Jonás, such as those on the collection of 1.5 million pesos, representatives of the home game in exchange for allowing its operation.
On Monday, the merits of the legal power of the casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, stood before the judge by José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the area, so he could get his freedom in the hours following.
During the legal formalities, the agent of the Public Prosecutor attached to the tribunal, Ramiro Garcia Gómez Arias, asked if the damage had been recovered and associates of the house of game was the one that had granted a pardon, but the lawyer has tried not to disclose the name.
According to the dossier 197 / 2011 is granted pardon legal Jonás Larrazábal and later we will present any claim on the lawsuit against him; he will require repair any damage and no punishment.
After the hearing on the merits of the legal power to the house of game, at 3: 50 p. m. we ordered the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón.
The clerk of the court, Jorge Yánez, has shifted to the prison of municipe San Nicolás de los Garza to communicate to Jonás that he had been forgiven and his case would be legally classified.
It will also give the order of immediate freedom that the judge has issued.
The Secretary Dionisio Perez Jácome gives communicates the details of the plane crash in which has lost his life the Secretary of the government, Francisco Blak and seven other people
The secretariat of Communications and Transport Credit Transfer (SCT) was informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which has lost his life the Secretary of government, Francisco Blak home in Mora and seven other people, indicate that the helicopter has shocked directly against the soil in full structural integrity, without the pilot can try a hard landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before takeoff aircraft, the pilot has found that the climate conditions were appropriate for flying.
“ The elements seem to indicate that the unit had meetings with the soil, pales had contact with trees to 25 metres where unity has lost the fuselage. ”
He also informed that unity was designed to 19 people, so it meets all the requirements necessary to transport the staff.
In addition, he said the investigations in the area of impact is the appearance of coins to the ground.
“ In a research we are told that there is no coins or components of the aircraft in a different location, the impact has been presented in a structural.
“ The helicopter had been designed to 19 passengers and met the requirements to transport them.
The soil had a pante from seven to 30 degrees inclination.
For the moment, the secretary has ensured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible, but the investigation could last a few months, it will last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, director of Aéroports and Services Auxiliaires has ensured that the moment of impact, the helicopter state pas Présidentiel worked in speed of cruiser and happened on a soft ground dominance.
“ This information supports the hypothesis of a functioning normal cruiser at the moment of impact, ” he said.
During the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Jácome has enumerated six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the prescriptive aircraft, the flight was done according to the visual flight rules, which means that the crew should have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM show proper conditions during takeoff, and as as the aircraft went to the area bordering between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of obscurity low height.
Roads selected:
It is likely that “ because of the conditions of obscurity crew has sought a zone of weaker and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
Details of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there has not been or loss of control or alteration of the trajectory of flight.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a restricted area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact was on a trajectory right and lateral.
The model of dispersal of debris from the aircraft suggests that the helicopter was against the soil in conditions of structural integrity.
It has not detected traces of fire or explosion:
In the place of the sinister there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft type of explosion or fire.
The final results of the investigation show that the aircraft has had repeated contacts with the soil.
During the work of the ground has been found parts of the aircraft to a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average level of the sea, the soil was a slope that goes for seven dégrées to 30 degrees inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he is possibly désarticulé throughout his journey.
The information provides elements seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had some impactes multiple with soil.
After careful research in an area greater than the place surrounded, around the accident, it has not found the coins disperses aircraft, which bears the presumption that the impact was held in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announcement protocol to find the gene to obesity
Insurance Sociale lead an investigation to discover the causes of obesity in children and young; this is borne by specialists in the IPN
The Institute of Social Mexicain Assurance (IMSS) announced that it was conducting an investigation to discover the causes of obesity in children and young people, called “ Génétique protocol of obesity in children and adolescents ” who will have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the unit, investigative medical biochimie 'Hôpital specialities of national medical centre of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that it had formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and assist social.
This team is supported by scholars and students graduate of the National Institute of Health Publique (INSP) and centre investigative and studies Avancées (Cinvestav) Institute 's National Polytechnique (IPN.)
In the investigation are invited to participate in the population or not law, to stand for units of participating in sports IMSS Valle de México, where is the evidence to minors every Saturday from 8: 00 a. m.
He stressed that the protocol began in Unity Sportive Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity is taking place in Unity Sportive of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of raising 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in Unity Sportive Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in Unity Sportive Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the target of the investigation and that the deal e components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and identify among children and young mexican of risk factors to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As we celebrate the November 14, the day the global Diabètes, he mentioned that the goal is to bring three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years ago, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the enforcement of questionnaires specific relating to food.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and background of heredity family of their illnesses, to avoid the risk factors that cause diseases like diabetes or kidney disease.
He explained that the Saturday we apply to all participants of measurement anthropometric systems (weight, size, the circumference of size), blood pressure, determining the levels of glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides, insulin and genetic (we are trying to identify people associated with obesity).
Cruz López has pointed out that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
“ Studies of the health of 1999 and 2006 have pointed out that in just six years there has been an increase in the case, boys, at 77 percent in obesity, and in the case of the daughters of the 47 percent; in relation to the overweight are also has seen a dramatic increase, ” emphasized the specialist IMSS.
He said that the justification for research markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from other by its genetic history.
He informed that on average, the Mexicans have a 65 percent of heredity indian - american, a 30 percent and a five percent african and this condition is reflected in the people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He said that in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability of burning the excess of energy consumed (calories), who puts in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is evaluating full of children, which helps to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obese.
Ila even said that the presence of the folds of dark colour (acanthosis) on the neck and the pre - trial indicate the likelihood of suffering the metabolic changes and even pre - diabetes.
The information is handled in a confidential, the doctors call by writing to parents, which are explained each of the measures and changes in the way of life that they must make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obese and other chronic conditions: the sédentarisme, which is the lack of physical activity daily, remain the most of the day sitting in front of the tv and use means of transport instead to go up on the short distances.
Another reason is the high caloric, namely the greater consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - pâté meat to maize flour wrapped in sheets of maize, bread, hamburgers, pizza, etc.) with a high content of fats and protein and the genetic analysis in this protocol.
The asphalt to avoid the blackcurrants UNAM
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mix with a yield, regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature
If the signales that the streets were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair some 200 thousand blackcurrants every season of rain in the area of Métropolitaine Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher from the Faculdade de of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, which ensured that if the construction and maintenance of tar paved is adequate, the blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During its conference an opinion on the technological blackcurrants, organised in the context of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory which he is responsible for developing asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mix with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a mechanical strength, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera has estimated that this type of asphaltes modified could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve returns, and therefore, the training of blackcurrants.
He explained that the asphalt, the more heavy oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a molecular weight more cumbersome, called asphaltènes molecules, and with a low molecular weight, called malthènes, which together give the paved his characteristic viscoélastique behaviour.
The behaviour viscoélastique asphalt is the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, to 120 degrees that its viscosity is very large and 50 degrees that it presents a state almost solid, while at very low temperatures, asphalt is dropping, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day in office environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The researcher 's FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a stone flexible, composed of six layers of materials, including the last three involve the asphalt.
Between classes more superficial is the layer of asphalt, trained by small stones drenched asphalt and packed later.
Each of the small stones which form the layer, signalât, is bathed year asphalt.
When the vehicle is generating efforts, this means that the forces spread very well in the street.
If we had asphalt changed, they are, the better propageraient opinât ingénier chemical.
On the layer of asphalt, he says, it makes a final layer called layer rolling stone, made in the end, that is to say, the sand is also flowing asphalt.
As it is the layer in contact with the wheels of cars, it needs more mechanical strength that the depletion of asphalt and provide grip in the street.
Being part of the street who receives and distributes the efforts, the layer rolling also requires it to have a proper thickness and the material, which it is made should be treated.
The climate, particularly the moisture and variations in temperature, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because they will significantly affect the returns of the layer of asphalt.
When the ground was wet, water spread within the layer is difficult as this way, what soggy lump all sections of the paved and therefore cause of blackcurrants.
In the trial of training a blackcurrants, he says, the first who spoiled the film is rolling and only later is affected the layer of asphalt, but the damage has not immediately, but this is a process which should be treated in the early signals with programmes maintenance.
The member of the national system of Chercheurs explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the training of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of paved must always be linked to the burden of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to prevent the formation of frequent blackcurrants.
Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, the émulsions bitumineuses that other countries are already on the market and help repair the blackcurrants easily and without having to use of high temperatures.
What has failed to Valle 's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made that Melina Ramírez Serna not obtaining the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives its title number 14 of princess.
New of Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with the fact of being on the podium of the winners, wear the crown of money and the gang that accredits as new princess of Colombia.
With the result yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is rising with the crown and the sceptre, the department sum already 14 titles of Princess and Melina is a a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who were found near the crown but have been proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Now the big question that a lot of people are asking is:
What is it failed because the outcome represents the defeat of a big favorite in each presentation has demonstrated that it had to be the new Miss Colombia because she had been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Brave New Visage Jolie of Vogue, titles won by the queen Taliana Natalia Vargas or Navarro, who has won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key to the decision by the sworn to appoint the First Princess is the fact that she has not satisfied with his answer to the question? ” the book does has marked and why? asked by Martín Gómez Murillo, Carreta Literaria Leamos.
That is the answer to the candidate of Valle to this question:
“ I read a lot, I think enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of culturaliser definitively, I believe that the book that has marked my childhood is “ the Little Prince ”, a book that is quite profound.
Now I read “ Crime and Châtiment ” is a book of literature Universal that we should read all; and now I read the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a lovely book called “ the zeal of the blood. ”
This response has not very fond first because of the term “ culturaliser ” and secondly for not explain exactly how every book cited had marked.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt relaxed and happy with the result “ the universe and wise, there is what needs to happen.
And for all the world, read please a little, “ the Little Prince ” is a great book ”
Between the assumptions launched that Valle has been destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist in Bogotá has insinuated that being the preferred the ovationnée and the candidate who received all the introductory price (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best suit handmade, and Queen Mother), “ this has awakened the envy of other candidates, has stressed the Queen and that is why it has not been on the scene. ”
And it noted that in his first presentation in bathing suit to the beach at Hilton and its two marches on the eve of the coronation.
Even if the two marches it had seemed unsure of itself, we noted that it did not have the strength and the energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme as “ in Casa ” (as at home), Channel RCN has said that the fact that Melina had been designated princess “ confirms that the candidate who gets most of the price for the contest does not receive the crown of Queen ”.
In addition, Valle has avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another possibility is that Valle has failed to convince the jury on its interest in social initiatives, which is the essence of the festival, National of Beauty.
That is why two days before the election the legally binding international Lucy Doughty said they sought a woman committed regarding social needs of his country.
“ Seulement beauty is not sufficient for a Miss Colombia, it must look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the competitions are already involved in projects, ” explained it.
It also speculates that Valle has sin by its flaws in its backside and fibrosis who observed in his abdomen, but this is a contradiction, precisely because the jury was elected as the candidate “ natural beauty ” with the body more healthy, nutrition and physical work responsible.
The initiator queens Hernán Jorge Orozco recognizes that Melina was not the best body, it was better, but “ the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me was not too well known, he has left the points the last day. ”
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine Cromos sees the error of the candidate of Valle was the surgery she had undergone.
“ The chirurgies are good, but Valle has failed them.
Her body was never his asset, and lost because of this aspect. ”
For that price, that the festival of National Beauty calls for the first time, after the parade in bathing suit has created a cruel prediction that was done last night, saying that it was a gift that Raymundo was to Melina not to give him a taste for the crown.
True or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year reign, not as sovereign, if not as Princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in an international competition by appointing the festival National.
However, it will go down in history as one of the queens despite its illuminating passage in Cartagena, has not achieved the crown.
So was the work of the person of Cali saw the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscopiste of Cali happened to history as the man who confirmed the death of “ Alfonso Cano. ”
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past 4 November a dactyloscopiste of CTI in Cali has risen to history as the person who has confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of Farc: “ Alfonso Cano ”, by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopistes working in local offices of CTI, this week it was the turn of “ availability ” Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada, who worked for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez has worked in the municipes of Chocó, where many times he has had to spend more than five days into the forest to reach the place where were the bodies that had to be identified.
The 2000 it was transferred to the capital of Valle and having follows prices suitable, he specialised in dactyloscopie, which is the study of skin friction, namely the paumes and feet.
During the week of the operation against a. k. a. Alfonso Cano had been warned to Eliazar to take with him clothes for at least three days.
Something very big the expected.
Friday night he went for Cauca in a helicopter gunship Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two bodies and suspected that one of them was that of the man who led the guérrilla oldest in the world, so he was asked to win the map with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when it arrived with the investigative teams to the corpse, he has not recognised by his physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He did not have a beard, he was dressed up as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much smaller.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a préleveur and a lamp, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye has not deceived: it was “ Alfonso Cano. ”
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón, that yes, it was the Supreme Leader of the Farc.
Research by the footprint
For a dactyloscopiste of Sijín of Cali recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos has done to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against “ Cano, is very significant. ”
A lot of people not familiar with our work.
The dactyloscopie is an exact science, no margin for error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
In part to identify the bodies, the dactyloscopistes support the investigation for crimes such as robbery and homicide and confirm the identities of people captured.
When are caught, many offenders pose ID cards false or have no documents.
We take their fingerprints and looking in the database.
The researcher Conté that in a case of theft he had to remove a section of wall of a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to shake a bank full of jewellery and money.
“ The walls are difficult because they are not of land suitable for a digital footprint, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the entire workforce and identify the offender, who had been involved in various flights, ” remembers it.
Fingerprints can also discount or confirm the suspects in the case of homicide.
Recently it has found a man dead, with bottles of drink around him.
By interlude of the investigation has determined that a parent can be suspicious of crime and indeed a mark on the bottle coincided.
Even if that no guarantees that there is not the killer, that the place on the scene of the crime.
A dactyloscopiste of CTI has explained that “ extracted the fingerprints of objects with reactive chemicals or physical. ”
When they appear, using a préleveur or a band for the levy.
Later, the prints are sent to Asif, the database of déclinquents, or the National Civil Registre.
“ The problem is that there is still a lot of colombian undocumented, ” identified the expert of CTI.
He explained that not everything is how the shows in the television programme CSI.
As all that glitters is not gold, everything that touches is not necessarily footprint.
It can be used, if we perform the necessary approach.
The “ indignant ” defy the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators they are in place to maintain Zuccotti.
A lot of people have joined the evacuation order and was moved to a nearby park.
The movement 's intégrants Occupe Wall Street have defied the Tuesday, the authorities in New York by trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, in place of Manhattan, where they have been evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of Great Pomme.
Hundreds of demonstrators they are before the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a judicial order that allows “ indignant ” of adopting new in this place, while the other part of the movement has responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new rulings.
“ Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to stand again in the square, we will move to another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit - ins and peaceful demonstrations, ” said a spokesman for the movement “ Occupe Wall Street, ” Mark Bray.
Bray has detailed that the response of the “ indignant ” to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came up to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings has issued an order that barred the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the “ indignant ” have occupied a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth when very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, ownership of the parish Trinity Church.
At least for one hour they have managed to occupy the place, but after the police was misplaced and arrested several protesters, even if Bray could not confirm the figure in ensuring Efe that he saw a few journalists who were once also passed the handcuffs.
The organization insists that there is the old people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved as a sign of support to members of the movement and has tried to intervene in favour of them to the police.
Meanwhile, place the Zuccotti - which is a place of private property - remains closed until the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, during which we should analyse the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some protesters moved so far and were placed at that time copies of this judicial order and they played by the same agents who were monitoring the place, which has caused “ some small clashes, ” said Bray, who has denounced the fact that some officials have hit the demonstrators.
The law prohibits the authorities to evacuate the members of Occupe Wall Street or “ laws published after the start of the occupation or ban for protesters to gain access to the park with new tents or other properties that they previously used. ”
Mayor Bloomberg has said in the press that, because of this law, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the protesters, to which he has warned, however, that the local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and handbags to sleep.
The councillor has personally defended the evacuation at the dawn of the place Zuccotti, an operation during which it has arrested 200 people and which has been decided, due to the fact that the protesters “ violated the law. ”
Bloomberg said he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was “ a place where people came to protest, but to violate the law, and in some cases to harm other people ” because “ some shops had received threats ” and “ the residents were afraid for their quality of life. ”
“ The evacuation of this morning at dawn was repulsive and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more concerned to protect the financial interests than those of american workers, ” added the spokesman of the movement, which accusa the mayor “ not to respect freedom of expression. ”
Those responsible for “ Occupe Wall Street ” have also said that they do not believe organising “ big actions ” for Thursday in conjunction with the community organisations and the unions to commemorate the two months of protestes, which started on 17 September.

Japan after the earthquake Returns
The GDP rise a 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of decline in the beginning of March
Since the March of the japanese economy was paralysed, still recovering after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country Japan since the Second World War.
The initial estimates of the government in Tokyo have calculated the material losses to 300 million dollars, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to be mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the data of the gross domestic product, between July and September have been used for finally turning the page; GDP demanding a 1.5% compared to the prior quarter and a 6% annualized rate.
Those recorded the second - quarter for the Japanese, the fiscal year starting in March 2012, implies, in addition, the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is due, in part, by the resumption of acquisitions of equipment for restoring the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies have increased their investment by 1.1%, compared to a drop of 0.9% capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of rising non - suspended.
However, the real boost of the japanese economy is based solely on the keynesian stimulus to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or - rebuild infrastructure, use the shortcomings in croitre of zero.
Japan awoken mainly thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents the 60% of Japan 's GDP.
This variable has loudly a 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma yen
Tokyo has been handed the internal market when the yen – the japanese currency – has become a “ safe - haven ” elected by investors fleeing from the debt crisis in the eurozone and unrest forecasts of the United States, a privilege hanging like a stone in the accounts export companies.
With a stronger divides, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose line of indecision is determined by the economic health of large groups of technology.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their poor results between July and September the subscription yen.
While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is bullish.
“ We need to monitor the risks that remain, as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen, ” said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of member countries have submitted in September clearer signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the points to influence the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are curbed.
Because it has dropped four decimal until 100,4 points, compared to 100,8 in August.
Area has even been above the average, which is in the 100 level, lowering eight until 99,13 decimal points.
Athens bolsters new doubts
Papadimos said that the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will sign any commitment writing
With the risk premiums peripheral triggered and uncertainty installed in parks, Greece continues to trip in the maze, which led to the exit of the great crisis of european debt.
The sensation that the “ consensus ” of the new transitional government Helennic is rather imposed by the demands of Brussels than a real conviction of political forces beginning to be borne out by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos pointed out yesterday that there is no alternative to the structural reforms and that the period of 100 days in his appointment may be short for the application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said he would not back new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the datte scheduled for February 19.
“ The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit on October 26, ” said Papadimos when it opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end up tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new president.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reforming the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras No emerging doubts about its position: “ we are committed to helping the transitional government, but we are committed to nothing more. ”
The leader conservatif went a step further in its pulse that EU and IMF, regulators who must release the 8 million that Athens needs with urgency, and has made clear that it will not approve any letter of commitment to getting the adjustments.
But the European Commission, irritated by the impact caused by going all the referendum of Papandreu yesterday, reiterated his demand that is firm: it will release aid if the new government and leaders of the main parties hellènes not signing “ a written undertaking without ambiguity as soon as possible. ”
The spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj Économiques Affairs, explained that the troika inspectors return “ soon ” in Athens to discuss with the new government “ the elements required to pay the sixth tranche ” of 8 million, even if there is a definitive date either.
The greek still have much to do.
The Queen Sofía: “ they are instruments for progress and hope ”
The Queen highlights the place “ prominent ” of Spain in relation to this type of finance
“ Spain has reached a place leading globally in the role of Micro - finances. ”
The Queen Sofía has pointed out that the country has become in the last two decades the second person in the world in terms of this instrument of cooperation that “ substance ” lies in the fact that it is a “ tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being. ”
The Queen unveiled yesterday the V - e Cup, the Microcredit Summit to Valladolid with the certainty that “ there is no doubt ” that such operations are “ absolutely necessary ” to achieve the Millennium established by the United Nations for 2015, and, “ very specifically, in that order as the reduction to half the volume of people who live with incomes under a dollar a day, which is “ set the poverty line. ”
“ Spain continues to work ” to expand the network of beneficiaries “ to every corner of the planet, and assumes the task with “ responsibility ”, said the Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and the inputs origins during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, “ guarantee the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poor, and especially for women ”, the main beneficiaries of these loans.
“ We have achieved many targets ” and “ we face many challenges. ”
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a heart of debate, but also as the platform from which to launch “ two basic goals. ”
And his Majesty, explained that the aim is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who responded to these financial services and that 100 million of these families out of poverty in which they live now.
The impetus for the design of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world “ has followed the path started a few years ago in a way ” by pioneer Muhammad Yunus, said the Queen Sofía as an “ act of justice and due recognition. ”
And she described the father of this instrument as a “ idealist admirable in the universal cause in the fight against poverty, ” the work of which she has enjoyed since 15 years ago, when the Queen has travelled to Bangladesh to experience on the ground its policy of loans.
This experience has been followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings as those celebrated the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “ in every meeting I saw a development continues, ” explained her Majesty, whose relationship with this project has brought them yesterday described as “ head of the family ” reunited to Valladolid from the “ deep pocket of the poor ”.
Finally, the Queen Sofía has finished his speech by encouraging people to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
“ Ethical imperative ”
The Ministry of External Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that the “ solidarity is an ethical imperative ” for any democratic state.
In this sense, it argued that it would be a mistake to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is a “ permanent obligation. ”
Jiménez considered that microloans require “ a serious political and rigorous dedicated to the eradication of poverty, ” and now “ more than ever ” governments in developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and do not let that be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is “ one of the main lines of cooperation for development. ”
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya, Rodriguez clapped “ success ” to give “ confidence ” for those “ excluded all closing the door ”; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León 's Riva, has welcomed the people here in a city that “ opens its doors contaminated the spirit of solidarity. ”
The CDU proposes to elect the President European
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without any real difficulty for Chancellor Angela Merkel, but also Chairman of the Christian Democrat party.
The future of Europe was not originally scheduled to the programme but won in the autumn, particularly to satisfy activists who consider the government policy too lenient towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was adopted almost unanimously.
On 1001 delegates, only nine were against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation for several minutes to which were right, at the end of their speeches, Angela Merkel and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the finance minister, very Europhile left no room for doubt.
The idea - lover of Chancellor – and the motion - is a slogan: “ the answer to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe. ”
Not only because Europe is peace but because “ nine million jobs rely directly on the euro. ”
For the Chancellor, “ it is time for a breakthrough in Europe ”.
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to tighten the control of the European Union on fiscal policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also lead to the election of the president of the European Commission to universal suffrage “ to give a face to Europe. ”
That, in any case, is one of the proposals of the motion passed by Congress that the inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the twenty - seven agree soon on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the milestone is asked.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight the weight of each country on the executive board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of each economy, which obviously meant to strengthen the weight of Germany.
To calm the atmosphere within his party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but it has not sought to win his Congress on the back of “ small ” european countries or countries in difficulty, quick to criticise the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe spends a paragraph on the importance of the “ Franco - german friendship, ” Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in hollow.
By pointing out that there are two centuries, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats Army napoleonic.
That represents the fraud judgments disease?
After the benefits, the UMP and the government launch an offensive on the disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux to visit a box of family allowances, and give a speech on the subject - recurring since 2007 – of the fight against fraud and social handouts.
And to accompany this offensive, which share a desire to make savings in a context of austerity, but no less heralded an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on the disease.
First in a goal of budget savings: the government is planning to impose the employees of the private a fourth day vesting before taking charge of a halt to work.
Clearly, without an agreement to special business, an employee who fall ill lose four days of pay, so at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measure that could arouse anger, but which would bring 280 million euros, according to the Echos.
And who would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic: officials to impose a day vesting uncompensated to work (they have so far not vesting period, against three days in the private).
While these matters are under discussion, the majority recovery also the subject of fraud, this time targeting abuse related stoppages.
“ The checks will be much more important, even if you are, you rembourserez, ” warned Xavier Bertrand at the microphone of RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As for other cases, stunts seem somewhat disproportionate with reality fraud stoppages.
It is indeed the subject since 2002 to continuously monitor and offensive policies, who most often borne fruit.
The French are not more patients than elsewhere in Europe.
We dwell on the national figures.
According to club national insurance (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million daily allowances have been issued in 2006.
According to the research institute and documentation in economic health, the daily allowance in 2008 accounted for 5% of health spending, with 11.3 billion.
Of this sum, 46% were maternity leave and work - related accidents, and 54% related to the disease, or 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French have been averaging 14.5 days of work, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of Alma Consulting Group.
An average which involves some differences: another investigation, published in 2007 by the website management career Monster. com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 french employees surveyed said they have taken no day of judgment disease.
Another study, this time to the Assurance disease, says that in 2010, 37% of stops disease were a period of less than eight days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days a month, 15% of one to three months and 11% above.
When compared with their european neighbours employees, the French are not more likely that the stoppages.
Long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall absence (for health reasons or not) swung in France between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud judgments disease is very little work on the black market.
About the fraud, it reached a small scale.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 that controls are systematic on the judgments of more than 45 days.
In 2008, about 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of 285 000 made to the judgments of short - term were “ unwarranted or too long ”, or 37 050 case.
In the case of the judgments of more than 45 days, systematically checked, there were 11% of cases “ inadequate or unjustified ” about 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, therefore 169 000 case “ unjustified ”, on several million employees had a judgment disease.
A figure which is very little face, for example, the black.
According to the UMP MP Dominique Tiananmen, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros in tax loss per year, which is more than the total cost of the daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than in the past.
Papadémos: Greece will implement a new restructuring plan
Greece will need a further adjustment programme to restore its economy.
This is what said Monday 14 November the prime minister, Lucas Papadémos before Parliament, adding that the 100 days given his unity government would not be enough to make this work.
“ To continue efforts to rebuild the economy, we need the support of our european partners and a new programme of fiscal adjustment, ” said the head of the government, which was giving his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the eurozone on 27 October will be the “ main task ” of the new government, because the country 's participation in the eurozone “ is at stake, ” he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos has predicted that the public deficit of the country will be reduced “ to around 9% of GDP by the end of the year, after having been to 10.6% in 2010 and by 15.7% in 2009.
The Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, made Monday its support for the measures already agreed to try to find a way out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not engage on an additional austerity.
“ We will not vote for new measures, ” he said during a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy.
It has said it agreed with the goals of reducing the deficit and the debt, and fight waste but hostile to any policy that bars the economic recovery.
Has Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has warned that the IMF and the EU does not débloqueraient the loan of 8 billion euros needed without written guarantee to all the parties that they will support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras responded that his speech was enough and that it will mean nothing under external pressure.
Legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a committee of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report from the Royal Society of Canada
In terms of palliative care, the committee is demanding that governments, institutions of health care, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.
The canadian company live in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians want to talk with their doctors about the conditions under which they want to die and to take measures to that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts linked to various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The committee recommended the government to change the criminal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice, from a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.
From the outset, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, who compared the quality of the death in 40 countries around the world.
If Canada was ranked 10th, the study notes that “ the medicalisation of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to approach the subject of death ”.
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to the palliative care, report the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire to have most of the canadian to die at home, 68,6% of them end up dying in hospital.
In all, the country is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and the assisted suicide, the report 's authors reach conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has said it will not change the criminal code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalised or decriminalised, there is no evidence that this decriminalisation would lead to abuse in the application, which is to say the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on people not competent or did not consent.
On the contrary, said yesterday in a teleconference Jocelyn Downie, author of the report, found in many more cases of these outbursts precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
“ The euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly unlawful ”.
“ Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, ” ” says Jocelyn Downie.
The canadian pro - euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow the people at the end of life to alleviate their suffering, according to the Angus Reid poll carried out in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalising euthanasia will not send the message that the life of elderly or disabled is worth less.
As for those who practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
In terms of maintaining or cessation of care from a patient, the picture is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be recorded in the criminal code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a refusal legally valid is not criminal.
The expert committee also asks for health professionals are trained on duty to comply with a refusal of care at the end of life, without fear of prosecution.
In terms of palliative care, the committee is demanding that governments, institutions of health care, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.
Finally, in terms of sedation palliative or terminal, already widely used in healthcare institutions canadian, the committee that it should be considered when it does not reduce the physical pain, as euthanasia, and that it will be subject to the same procedures.
Stocks of other experts
Some experts in the field of health have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report by experts at the Royal Society of Canada.
Deschamps, Pierre, a specialist in right to health, has described as “ extreme ” position experts signatories of the report, among other things, because it does not reduce the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill.
“ This opens the door to a situation where everyone is tired of life and who have more than 18 years could request that help it to commit suicide, ” said Deschamps, who had consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Now I Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to put the autonomy of the person above all other values that are part of the social fabric of society.
However, “ in society, he says, there are beacons and constraints. ”
The law specialist health Margaret Somerville also expressed “ strong opposition ” to the report 's conclusions, which she called “ a clear pro - euthanasia. ”
Margaret Somerville, which itself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests in particular the data in the report about the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The king of Jordan urge President Assad to leave power
Damascus condemned a “ plot ”
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al - Assad marched yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria 's Bashar al - Assad, who, with the support of Russia, their resistance and denounced a “ plot ” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria from the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighboring Syria, have taken a position in favour of a departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the first arab leader to call on President Bashar al - Assad to “ step down ” in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime forces have been killed.
“ If Bashar was concerned about the interest of his country, he should resign, but it should also create the conditions for a new phase in the syrian political life, ” said the king of Jordan, a neighbour of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, the head of the turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu has complained that the turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the start of the year to the syrian regime were unsuccessful.
“ Those who are not in Middle East peace with their peoples and cannot satisfy them leave, ” he said, referring to Syria, where Turkey takes a line increasingly harsh.
The United States is on their side, welcomed a “ strengthening the consensus against Assad and the actions of the syrian regime ”, following the decision of the Arab League and the European Union.
“ The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey tone adopting an increasingly tough ” with the repression in Syria, has watched Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces have died in the region of Deraa in the south of Syria, said the syrian Observatory of Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians were killed “ in exchanges of gunfire and shelling the heavy machine guns in Jobar ” in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGOS.
At a press conference, the syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem has estimated that the country is “ moving towards the end of the crisis. ”
He has also reacted strongly to the Arab League 's decision to suspend Damascus for its work, which is “ not a dangerous. ”
“ Syria will not shrink, ” he added, assuring that “ plots ourdis against Syria fail. ”
After his decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League now studying a “ mechanism to protect civilians ” and would send 500 members of organisations arab human rights, media and military observers in the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also called for sending observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from the repressive regime that sticks in the “ paranoia ”.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat and take stock of the implementation of the plan exit decided on November 2, including the withdrawal of armed forces from cities in the grip of the challenge and the release of detained protesters.
The russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said yesterday, “ incorrect ” the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the plan exit, while failing to support sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti takes time to markets and the sacrifices Italians
The future of Italy, Mario Monti, has called for a short time to markets to form his team and implementing a programme, which contain “ sacrifices ”, to retrieve the lost credibility in the final months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussions with the political parties yesterday before we meet today the unions and employers.
It should be a relatively small cabinet of technocrats outside Parliament.
“ Monti spoke of an important programme with a lot of sacrifices, ” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small groups engaged in talks, having met with the chairman of the board appointed.
The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, for its part, has said that Mario Monti request by Friday a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will be completed by the presentation by Mr Monti a shortlist, probably a dozen ministers, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti has commented on the nervousness of markets to stock and bond yesterday, asking them time.
“ In democracy, there are deadlines ” to prepare a government and its programme, he stressed, saying “ certain that the markets are patients and understand. ”
His appointment by President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but concern has regained the upper hand after an unexpected fall in industrial output in the euro area in September.
Prime Minister - designate should be a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he has said he would like to include “ political ”.
The new government must continue until 2013, the next legislative, he estimated.
According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will have the confidence of parliament by Friday.
Mr. Monti pledged, once in office, to work quickly and with the aim that Italy became “ protagonist ” in Europe.
A spokesman for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn has said that “ even with a new government, our diagnosis on the italian economy does not change. ”
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its aim to balance the budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has asked including new austerity measures.
The “ boss ” of the head by pulling italian Emma Marcegaglia, which will see it on Tuesday, has also stressed the need to revive the economy, because “ a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of deficit. ”
Mr. Monti, renowned for his expertise and its independence as European Commissioner (1994 - 2004), represents a “ momentous change ” for Italy after 17 years of “ berlusconisme ”, “ the Professor ” symbolizing the challenge of “ serious ” and “ another Italy ”, according to the newspaper columnists.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would avoid early elections because Italy must place by April 2012 to 200 billion euros of bonds.
A russian scientist has helped in the iranian nuclear programme
A russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator usable with a nuclear weapon, said Monday an NGO american specialising in the nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Agency for the atomic safety (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to identify the researcher.
The IAEA has indicated last week of its “ serious concerns ” about “ possible military dimensions ” of Iran 's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, drawing widely in documents to the IAEA, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades from the 1960s in a centre in Chelyabinsk (soviet nuclear military urals), and have been involved in the manufacture of diamonds by synthetic explosion.
In 1989 and 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing “ nano - diamonds ” in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of its society have led to contact the iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated in the iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA says “ strong indications that the development of Iran ” of a system of bang nuclear “ has been helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew of this technique, but which, as a member state in has informed the agency, has worked for most of his career in this technology within the military nuclear programme of their country of origin. ”
The crimes and offences anti - Muslim have risen by 50%
The crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, the other racial and religious violence have fallen slightly or little progress, according to statistics from the FBI made public Monday.
According to the figures, the total number of violence against Muslims has risen from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, is 49% increase, compared with an increase of 13% of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% of violations against Jews and an overall increase of 14% of crimes anti - religious.
The total number of “ hate crimes ” has increased slightly to 6 628 case, whose 47,3% driven by differences of race and 20% by differences of religion, according to the FBI.
“ After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences rise again, ” said the human rights organization Human rights First, “ increased violence antimusulmanes is particularly significant, ” added the organisation in a statement.
“ Human Rights First has long stressed that the violence against Muslims and all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights ”, adds one of the leaders of the organisation, Paul Legendre.
“ The US government can and must do more to tackle these abuses, ” it added, estimating that it could go through an improvement of reports of police on the “ hate crimes ”.
The “ hate crime ” in the US federal law is a legacy of the era of the fight for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence related to race, the color of the skin, religion, origin and now sex.
Twitter is changing its platform and is more like Facebook
The micro - blogging site Twitter has introduced Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, especially to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes her look like a little more to that of Facebook.
A new onglet “ activity ” and another “ name ” can follow more obvious, in direct the activity of other “ Twittos ” Internet users, which follows the messages (“ tweets ”) and those who follow you.
This allows whether they follow messages and Internet new accounts, if they have a favourite messages, etc.
This new formula of Twitter has been tested on “ a small percentage of users in August ” before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, told the AFP, the spokeswoman for Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its operation little instinctive, with words somewhat esoteric (RT to place a message from someone else, # followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of insiders, opens with a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the general public networks Facebook and Google +.
On the network, users flapping in “ tweets ” settled on the interest of this innovation.
“ This is pointless, invading, and it is too similar to Facebook, ” wrote @ jemb123.
“ The functionality Activité will help me to better monitor elements of my Twitter stream, ” has sent @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
A “ golden rule ” budget in the Constitution
The government of grand coalition Social Democrat / Christian Democrat in power in Austria decided Tuesday to enshrine in the Constitution a “ golden rule ” budget in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid a possible downgrade by the rating agencies of Austria (triple).
This is the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who has even announced the decision at the end of a council of ministers, while public debt is austrian 74,6%, well above the criterion of 60% maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“ If the solvency of Austria was lowered by one notch, from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion euros of interest in more each year, ” argued the Vice - Chancellor and Christian Democrat Minister Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is following a request from the summit in Brussels euro area countries of 26 October: the heads of state and government then requested the inclusion by the end of 2012 the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or a law of equal value.
The measure passed by the austrian government is close to “ german model ”, Germany was the first european country to adopt such a “ rule ”.
By 2017, the structural deficit will reduce each year to 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the structural deficit of federal government should not exceed every year 0.35% of GDP, while the regional states and municipalities to present balanced budgets.
The aim is to increase to 2020 / 21 public debt below 60% of the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong yen
Noda threat of a new intervention in the currency market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the japanese authorities again intervening in the currency market if the yen should continue to rise.
“ We do as we did last time if we see an excessive volatility ” in the exchange rate of the yen, said Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historic levels that prompted the japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo has sold heavily yen against the dollar in order to lower the value of the japanese currency, which had just set a new record of force against the greenback since 1945.
But the yen is regularly picked up since, boosted by purchases of investors who see it as a “ safe haven ” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar rose on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic of 105 yen, close to levels that triggered the last speech.
Before the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009, with the dollar trading at around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in the currency japanese night for exports of the archipelago because it adds a little extra cost of products made in Japan and reduces the value of income from overseas by japanese firms, when they convert them into national currency.
“ Japan fight to rebuild ” since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the region of Tohoku (north - east), said Mr. Noda, who fear that the higher yen kills in the bud the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power has returned to growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption plombés by the disaster.
But the prime minister has ruled that the high yen did not reflect “ the economic fundamentals of Japan ”.
The Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for its part, has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened Tuesday, a two - day meeting of its board of monetary policy, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “ appropriate measures ”, suggesting that no additional monetary easing was expected Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the Institute of emissions has increased by 5 trillion yen ($47 billion) its purchases of Treasury bonds, bringing to 55.000 billion yen (519 billion) the ceiling of the sums it spends to purchases of securities various to flood the market liquidity.
Eurozone:
The rates are rising, the stock exchanges flanchent
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines the european indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of vulnerable countries are continuing to rise.
Always worried about the stability of the euro zone, european stock markets are a little more in negative territory, on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC 40 falls' s, losing 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt surrenders 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“ With the new tensions on the yields on bonds of troubled eurozone, share markets across the world continue to make some of their recent gains. ”
“ Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion, ” ” says Terry Pratt, institutional trader at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed down 0.7%, in turn, fears of renewed market participants about Europe 's ability to contain the debt crisis.
“ Japan, as the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and the exchanges will continue in a corridor of variations close as investors do not have evidence that the situation has stabilized, ” says Mitsushige Akino, a fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concerns over the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency, which continues its decline Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
To 's, the european currency worth 1,3570 dollar and a fall of 0.4%.
According to brokers, she relented after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, met on Monday, Congress has passed a motion that includes the possibility for a struggling country leaving the eurozone without leaving the EU.
The italian and spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at levels very worrying.
Tuesday morning, the yields on 10 - year italian bonds reached 6,85%, spanish bonds of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on interest rates from the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of speakers.
The head of the future government of Italian Mario Monti has demanded time to markets to salvage the situation in Italy, at risk of suffocation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the eurozone on 27 October is the “ main task ” of his government.
Spain is in the firing line of the markets, while being held Sunday parliamentary elections in the country.
The difference in rates (“ spread ” between the obligations to 10 years in Germany and Spain has reached a new historically high.
Pending the growth figures for the eurozone
Side statistics, France has seen an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the 0.3% expected, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee has revised downward the figure of the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, this is truly the fourth that most worried economists.
Germany, for its part, has seen a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the whole of the eurozone is expected at 11 a. m., while the European Commission has warned against the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must outweigh the dogmas
If it is a subject that we cannot treat from considerations of short - term or under “ emotion, this is the energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and business competitiveness.
It is right for a rendezvous electoral is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and instead that it takes the nuclear.
The debate will be successful only if it is exploring all the economic, social and environmental impact of the proposed options.
The French have to base their opinions on objective facts, data rational.
While we are 7 billion “ human beings on the planet, ” the demographic changes will lead to a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, at least to deprive a huge proportion of the global population of a vital element.
At the same time, we need to compensate for declining resources fossil to continue to generate electricity continuously, not to mention the urgent need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to combat climate change, a subject disappeared from the debate.
The Fukushima accident has not changed any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes it to the need to find a source of replacement able to replace, and Switzerland, which wants to do more than just build plants last generation.
Conversely, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for example, continue their projects with determination.
The US, after Fukushima, they decided to add a unit in their fleets by incorporating the building a plant suspended after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the german model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes cited as an example, the reality upset about the speech.
The choice of Berlin will translate into a higher price of electricity, energy dependence aggravated by the increased reliance on imported gas, especially Russia, a leap of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of plants to gas and coal.
In a few months, all of these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
Denmark is to entertain.
European champions of the “ wind, which it draws 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of wind, according to that, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the european average.
Conversely, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a bill for “ electricity more than 40% of french households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor for competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial capacity on the national territory, french companies are benefiting from the electricity ” the cheapest in Europe.
Thus, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would create a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make the false statements on the re - industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of french people refuse to pay, so that they are not opposed in principle to this energy, polls show.
Remember that the energy policy of our country has helped build an industrial sector of 125,000 jobs directly and 410 000 jobs created.
Strong exports, it involves a galaxy of SMES specialist on international markets and makes them very job creators - transferable.
If France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, this would sacrifice many of these SMES by reducing alarmingly the 6 billion annual exports of french “ nuclear equipment and services.
What would seem an electrician EPR designed to function sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be scheduled?
“ To solve the equation energy, we must recognise that there are no source of electricity generation ” miracle, not more than currently exist of evil.
The development of solutions by Areva little emitting CO2, nuclear and renewable, shows the complementary sources of energy.
For the nuclear, maintaining the highest level of security is an imperative.
We have in France a security authority to which oversees intransigent and transparent on existing plants as on the site Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, are inhabited the same obsession of safety.
In a half - century, the nuclear industry has had three serious accidents.
A single, Three Mile Island, intervened in the normal operating conditions; he remained without consequence human or environmental.
Chernobyl has, the design of the reactor and faults of human unforgivable caused the tragedy.
Was Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale, which have led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons from this accident, as it did for the previous two.
Fruit of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities, operators and the french and german manufacturers, the EPR presents a design making it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is regarded by all the electricians wanting to build a plant, the judgment of its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered the competitors to EDF and Areva in their opening our doors to grab the leadership in the key nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek out the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow the “ emotion, dogma and partisan tactics dominate a debate as critical to economic, financial and social situation in our country.
Immigration is a burden or a chance for the economy?
Immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles, overcrowded police, judicial and administrative subjected to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the status of self - proclaimed “ the country of human rights ” of France.
More recently, the administrative harassment of foreign students who has been in the news, the Minister of the Interior (read release of 23 May), proclaiming that “ France does not need of overseas talent, bricklayers and servers restaurant. ”
But it is rarely seen in economic terms.
It is that there is a broad consensus between left and right.
Has the right, the tone has been given by Jacques Chirac, who said in 1976 that “ 900 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers ”, and left by Michel Rocard, explaining that France “ cannot take all the misery of the world ” in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of national territory by hordes of polish plumbers was shared on the left and right.
For the two sides, immigrants are seen as a burden for the economy and the french company.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that are prepared to pay towards immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is the mundane, indicating that the co - development will solve our “ migration problem. ”
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may pay off electorally; but it is economically very costly.
As a reminder, economists Ian migration and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book, summarising the knowledge the latest on immigration (Exceptional People: how Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among those on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and jobs in countries that receive immigrants.
Restrict immigration anaemic growth and employment.
The fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they could replace the national workers, particularly the unskilled, exerting downward pressure on wages.
But the experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are much more complementary as substitutes for national employees, mostly in shortage occupations in the areas of employment.
The low - skilled immigrants working in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not following the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon is unlikely to work in a country which has a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between national and migrants are that the influx of immigrants have a positive effect on salaries and employment of national.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that an increase of 1% of migratory flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that the variety made by immigrants contribute to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized among the Nobel Prize american; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been founded by immigrants).
The migrants are also contributors of social systems, in an average of 1% of the total budget in european countries.
The International Labour Organisation believes, for example, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years will bring a net contribution (revenue less spending) of 150,000 euros public budgets in average throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to, at the beginning of the mandate, fetch the points of growth “ missing teeth. ”
The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, have had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, is to think european democracy
Democracy is a precious thing; it is also a very fragile.
The european continent should remember, for having invented in Athens over two thousand years, has known throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some believing that it will be enough for democracy triomphât definitively of its enemies, to exercise the vote, and the exercise of the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon “ the Little ”, that it was a facility of thought.
The universal suffrage, to be a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and could even be done “ instrument of oppression ” as said once the philosopher Republican Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, a separation of powers and a control, education, the Enlightenment, supportive economic and social justice.
The crisis in Europe that we live is an economic crisis, but it is equally and to begin a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinodie of true - false greek referendum has taken in this regard value of double revealing: the need for a return of the powerful political, but also the disquieting sense of his impossibility, for its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the frontlines of the democratic contest are now displaced, and that, for many of them, the soldiers Republicans no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to demand a succession of national referendums, organised by the needs and fragmented.
A free rein in absolute monarch or leap up like in the vacuum of nationalist reaction: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want off but an exercise, common, right, calm and steady, choice and democracy, this time at the european level.
There is no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - no one more stop where the “ listing – because there is a crisis, and it is in Europe.
This is all over Europe who pander to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from his impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe which is humiliated on the international stage.
They are worried about transfers of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore to the popular sovereignty piloting of the european project.
Because it is whole, that the Europeans can reduce the weight of their debts, free markets and prepare for the future by investing.
Exit the crisis mean decisions at the european level that can be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
Having fought long this proposal of the socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is asking for european economic government.
Either.
But the thinking without integration policy and more democratic, and seen as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and another impasse.
We have a new stage of european integration.
To make the Republic in France, it took “ do ” of Republicans.
The revolution in the interests could not be sufficient.
This lesson is still valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done in building a more democratic politically, a genuine popular sovereignty.
In Europe, the Europeans.
Smart cards “ without contact ” spreading
The living room of the global chip card opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in a climate optimistic.
The year 2011 should indeed end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards to chip (bank card, with telephone SIM card …), more than 6 billion units, according to the cabinet Eurosmart.
The segment is the most prominent technology without contact that helps pay for public transport or to settle its purchases by approaching just a map of a reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards without contact should be sold around the world, against 320 million a year earlier.
Their share is expected to make progress in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for smart card (6,925 million cards).
Long the world of the Asia - Pacific region, Europe, gaining ground for the payment without contact.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75 payment terminals to accept.
In France, the start is more modest: 400 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But supermarkets put into overdrive.
Crossroads has issued this year and 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards without contact.
To move up a gear, we must now that banks equip their customers.
“ Two big french institutions have committed to spread to the future systematically to their customers' cards equipped for the without contact, ” announcement Gérard Nébouy, director general visa Europe France.
The banks being examined by mobile payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Little devices are now equipped with the technology Near Field Communication (NFC) necessary for transactions.

The Sahara in Nigeria, the front terrorist extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
Suspected longstanding ties between the terrorist group al - Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the deputy Algerian Foreign Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, has even said that in Algiers has now “ satisfied ”.
“ The way the two organisations operate and reports of intelligence services show that there are good cooperation, ” he said without explanation.
Paris seems to be a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two frenchmen in Niger in January have uncovered bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were killed overnight at the same time as several of their captors during an operation by french special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, the investigators French and Niger to return several phone chips belonging to terrorists.
Axis terrorist
The analysis of earlier calls inching towards several partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), numbers two particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigérien who has travelled extensively in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and the other with a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
“ This is a step forward, but we should probably wait for evidence more formal before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram. ”
“ But it is possible ”.
“ She has known for years that the sect has financial backing and intellectuals outside and it is increasingly active, ” dampening Kunle Amuwo, a researcher in Nigeria.
In recent months, the “ support ” had been increasingly evident in the development and the language of Boko Haram or in its methods, which involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and even bill than those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to begin in Washington, has therefore been pressure on Abuja in that it takes into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The nigerian authorities have long considered the group as a community of theorists little worthwhile.
A swift victory
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and Iman fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram, which means in haoussa “ western education is a sin ” - calls for the establishment of an islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
She was politicizing and requires a strict adherence to Sharia law while its activists engage the fight against the central government infidels.
They aim to begin the churches, bars, authorities.
In 2009, the militant Boko Haram are particularly active, increasing the number of attacks on police stations.
The reaction of Abuja is, as usual, unsubtle.
The military invests the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
Therefore the sect will radicalize and leave its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, it claims an attack which made 80 deaths in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, is still in Abuja that Boko Haram blames HQ secure police during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be his first target international.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa which is operating from Mauritania to Somalia, Nigeria now worried about all the security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, that Somalis al - Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat at the heart of the continent.
Last week, in an interview with Nigeria President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned Boko Haram and said that it is “ ready to share all the information. ”
The world according to the republican candidate for the presidency
On China, Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and compete and oversimplification of ignorance.
An America weakened by the crisis can manage a complex world with simple ideas, even simplistic?
To listen to the republican presidential candidates, voters might believe.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other multiplying thundering declarations and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republican.
On China, Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans – often unsubstantiated - mounts.
Mitt Romney, the best position in the race for the nomination of the Grand Old Party ”, has threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and put them in “ cause for manipulating their currency, ” a theme carries in an America exasperated by the migration of large swathes of its industry to Asia.
Too bad if it must involve the onset of a trade war, ” he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former ambassador to China under Obama and only candidate to have a view of foreign policy sophisticated threatened to strangle faced with an attitude that “ panders to the emotions. ”
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is staying in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
The image of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
“ If I am elected, I stop Iran, he fanfaronné. ”
“ If Obama is re - elected, they have the bomb. ”
He has also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in its obligations to the partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second candidate best placed, poster with a lack of embarrassing files.
Recently, he called threat to counter the chinese military because Beijing “ trying to develop nuclear capability ” - apparently ignoring the fact that China holds the atom military since 1964.
The texan Governor Rick Perry, which supports Israel and want strikes against Iran is prepared to engage the american army in Mexico against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
This is far from the republican nominee in 2008, John McCain, a lorry in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and he has won the Cold War.
They stressed that Obama himself was an amateur and he has to make his wine for counter - terrorism.
They rightly stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, leaving too precipitous “ boys ” of Iraq, on its dithering in Libya, sucking him and a label of low.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population judge rather positive assessment of the national security of Obama, who has eliminated Bin Laden.
In Iraq, it is wary of military interventions that lead to the stalemate.
And, on the grounds that it must rebuild economically America to resurrect its leadership, Obama hits fairer.
Nord Stream, new door ntrée of russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia to at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, entered into service.
It must provide gas to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the russian gas giant, wanted to mark the event with outburst.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government have participated, last Tuesday, on the banks of the Baltic, between orchestra and Buffett end, at the opening of the Nord Stream, this new pipeline, which connects directly under the sea, Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart in the Netherlands Mark Rutte have turned the wheel of the valves commander the entry of russian gas network in Western Europe.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas additional will arrive each year in Western Europe with a first tube of 224 1 km from the region of St Petersburg in Mecklenburg - Pomerania.
A second pack must be completed late 2012, enabling us to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of any french consumption.
And the already being mentioned the possibility of building a third on the same course.
For Gazprom, completion in time for this enormous project has the air of victory.
The project had been strongly opposed by Poland and the baltic states.
Nord Stream will allow us to deliver gas directly in Germany, avoiding overland passage through a third country (Poland and Ukraine).
These two countries are losing some of their power: it is becoming more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to shut down access to western european markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to “ a new german - soviet pact ”, in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, to lend its support to the russian project, has gained a greater security of supplies.
But it is the price of a weakening in Europe of energy, since the project has created a rift between East Europeans and the West.
Russia has managed, in five years ago, uphold his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy western countries, heavily consumers of gas, and whose deposits are in decline.
“ This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new highway that connects us organically, ” confirmed François Fillon in unveiling this pipeline, demonstrating how the large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles propounded by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number to Lubmin, at the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of the pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The tube submarine is steel gainé padding in order to protect it against the anchors of ships.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, 200 me on average.
For the building, it had to prevent of landmines dating back to World War II.
“ A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, just in case, ” says Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
It was also more measures to protect wildlife.
The tube is a long snake of heavy metal, as 242 Eiffel tower, that nothing off on its entire length: neither blowouts, or station maintenance.
A platform to control was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project was abandoned when the swedes were unwilling to see a society of russian state to settle permanently off their coasts.
“ In cases of fault, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute, ” says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the pipeline to escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have forecast soudures to suffer a brain every 100,000 years.
The surveillance of the state of the pipeline is provided by a robot submarine, dragged by a ship, for comment outside, as well as by a device that is circulating in the pipeline.
The format of a cigar, it is introduced to the interior of the tube, broad of a meter in diameter, and it is driven by the gas.
In the end, after three days of travel at the speed of 3 metres second book, it accurate information on possible misrepresentations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to function fifty years without having to go through any repairs.
The movement of the gas is simply guaranteed by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 to the arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% stake.
If there are attached to the german E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the group French GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, which built and operate the pipeline.
Based in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly good.
Gazprom has subsequently rented in this society, for 20 years, the total capacity of transportation of gas.
“ Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas really transported, ” says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline has been assured by shareholders and 30% to 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has risen to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are safe to enter their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The pipeline is emerging from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted pine.
The valves, high of 4.5 metres, are the way out of gas.
Sensors that measured the temperature, pressure and characteristics of gas that arrives, before he was transferred to the german pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic meters of russian gas to every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a book marks.
Created a fortnight ago by an italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It smacks of adventures, hours to write to light a candle.
The book Moleskine recognisable, with its cover rectangulaire black, his elastic, its leaves of a colour white broken, as old by the time.
Yet the book Moleskine as we know it today is born … in 1997.
The italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides to launch a rating design but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consulting company for the company, the launch of the new product.
The book is based on an old technique of production, the mole skin (skin mole), which designates a cotton veneer used to cover the benches for example.
This kind of book was very revered writers and travellers.
“ Moleskine has dredged up a subject old and forgotten, who was an icon of artists avant garde, until the XX century, ” says Maria Sebregondi, become over the head of the brand among Modo Modo.
The success is.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales have risen by 26% to establish itself to 12.7 million coins passed.
It is a far cry from the production of confidential first years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine transcends borders and italian exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to create images of the buyer, because the rating attracted both the businessman students and professionals.
The image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open - minded and cultivated.
The small italian company, who were 12 employees at its inception in almost 100 today and has since 2008 to two offices; one in Milan and another in New York.
It distributes its books in bookshops, Fnac small shops in the city centre and was able to impose its identity.
“ We have followed the air time and this need new writing, despite the rise of e - mails, ” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signing with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched an exhibition “ Detour ” where architects and artists expose their own book.
In August, it has also launched a coverage in leopard, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival of.
Taking advantage of his success and this is cultural, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, housses computer … the brand is declining on a wide range of mediums.
A success that has is appealing: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why the unemployment rate for disabled workers is so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are seeking work.
The 15th week for employment of disabled opens today.
Despite a proactive policy implementation in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is still more than twice the average: 19%, compared with 9 percent for the general population.
Depressing?
“ No, says Eric Blanchet, director general of the Adapt, the association organises week for employment of disabled. ”
“ The progress made since 15 years are considerable. ”
“ At the time, the unemployment rate was not two, but three times higher. ”
“ There is still a lot to do. ”
It must be said that for the unemployed disabled, the obstacles remain many before access to employment.
Rather, they are older: 37% are over 50 years (17%).
They have a level of qualifications: 80% do not have the box and on the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 000 are disabled.
Finally, long - term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, against 38% on average.
In short, all criteria that hampering the return to employment, and who are “ the crux of the problem ”, according to Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses to recruit workers with disabilities.
So much for the brakes objectives.
The remains unsaid, people who are changing, but too slowly.
A survey conducted in April by the association IMS - long shot for the City indicated that managers surveyed have “ a low level of knowledge of disability, ” with a “ pushing wheelchairs, impaired mental or intellectuals. ”
As a result, the private companies in more than 20 workers are still far from achieving the target of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law … in 1987.
The latest figures known, dating back to 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
“ We are now around 3%, ” says Peter White, director of the Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting the contributions of the businesses that do not comply with the law.
The evidence: the number of institutions “ taxed ”, as the amounts paid, have fallen between 2007 and 2011, from 59 to 46 (000 000 structures and 606 to 480 million euros).
“ The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre White. ”
“ But this also represents a real awareness, particularly in large groups. ”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers against 82% of companies from 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: “ what of happiness ”
Prior to confront the blues on Tuesday evening (8.45 p. m.) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens have not concealed the pleasure that gives them the friendly match.
We will not go so far as to say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the podium in the auditorium of the stage of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after the gesture of mood of its attacks against Turkey, the breeder belgian has only praise to its subject.
“ I am very glad to be Eden, of its progress, and the fact that it is belgian. ”
“ I want to move forward, ” provides the Lillois.
About the contrastre between its benefits in club and selection, “ is an entirely, he justified. ”
“ Lille, I am all year, which is not the case with Belgium. ”
“ It should I take my brands. ”
Spared against Romania on Friday night for the match against France, Hazard comes at Saint - Denis, finally, to “ shine. ”
Without fail, however, the concept of “ fun ”.
The blue, he encouraged them since the age of seven years and the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“ I have always been bear, ” he says.
Inevitably, it helps to strengthen the “ special nature ” of the meeting.
All that, “ there are Mathieu Debuchy () (), Yohan Cabaye and Adil Rami (), ” rapelle there.
“ We sat just now. ”
“ To play against them, it is that of happiness! ”
With bonhomie Leekens, for its part, has spoken of the “ pride ”.
“ Fierté ” contest of “ a game of night. ”
“ Fierté ” also noted as “ neighbor ” – that France is “ once again become a team of very high level ” a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“ Laurent White was a work of thunder, ” he enthused.
While Belgium will miss the next euro, the technician would slice of the aircraft with the blue direction … Brazil in 2014.
“ Our small Belgians are great, ” he said.
“ We are in the process of building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry. ”
“ You are going to you during the coming games against France. ” that included.
Portugal very confident
Portugal 's Paulo Bento starts with great optimism his dam return against Bosnia (10), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
The move, the two teams had been realistic.
“ At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, happy ”.
Paulo Bento has already sees, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt, the Selecçao, of which he is the manettes since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is one match to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to destabilise.
In light of the match to go (0 - 0), Friday in hell in Zenica, it seemed clear that the games are not facts.
Portugal has dominated the part for over an hour, but he has been unable to score that goal so precious, who would have relieved.
“ This is a good result, which carries some risks, however, because we do not have taken aim at the outside ”
But at home, in their bright stage of the Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, before an audience that should be too bouillant, even if the game announcement of course “ very tight ”, by one Bento optimistic but lucid.
“ We look forward to a very tight match, but we are sure to take over, ” said the Portuguese coach of 42 years.
“ We continue to have 50% chance of being in the euro 2012 ”, has challenged the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The one reported Friday Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to score and win.
No one can be enough to Bosniens, who also need to score.
“ This is a good result, which carries some risks, however, because we do not have taken aim at the outside, ” regret Bento.
“ We are going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and which has players with great individual qualities, ” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have the intention of entry to put maximum pressure on Bosnians to “ do not give them time to think. ”
A good idea, provided of realism, this time.
