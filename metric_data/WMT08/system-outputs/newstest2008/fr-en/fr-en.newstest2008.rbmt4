Official predictions pointed out only 3 for one hundred, announced Bloomberg.
Contrary to the American, British and Canadian central banks, the European central Bank (BCE) did not lower the rate of intéret manager by saying that the reduction of intérets, with the growth of the prices of matieres premieres and the fall of the unemployment rate, would drive has the generation of an inflationary spiral.
BCE would like to support the rate of inflation below but close to two for one hundred.
To an analyst, it is the Wrestling 22 for BCE: " it is necessary to dissuade " the inflation not to have any more has intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3,3 for one hundred is a record in the course of this twelve dernieres years and in Spain, it went back up from 3,6 has 4,1.
The inflation in the euro area took off has reason of the quick increase of the prices of feeding and energy.
The quotations of the market has term of grain augments 88 for one hundred and the lesson of soya also attained its most well brought up value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also considerably augmented in 2007.

Gallup Poll points out a crisis of the government
After a long inactivity, the number of the supporters of the Fidesz (Alliance of the young democrats) augmented significantly at the beginning of December. So since 2002, it has nowadays the biggest number of supporters, while Gallup Poll (Institute of opinion poll) has never determined before such a weak socialist support, has know 13 for one hundred.
For the fideles voters, difference would represent, owing to the biggest determination of the voters of opposition, a support of more than two thirds (71 for one hundred) against the support of a cinquieme (20 for one hundred) for MSZP (Left Hungarian socialist).
According to opinion poll, MDF (Forum of the Hungarian democrats) and SZDSZ (Alliance of the free democrats) is under parliamentarians' threshold: their support is two for one hundred in all population.
On the fideles voters some to go to vote, number it of supporters of both parties augments 1 for one hundred.
Economic climate continued deteriorating in comparison with the previous the lowest point, the proportion of those who judged that the financial standing of the country was particulierement serious was never also well brought up, it comes has 41 as one hundred and according to 46 for one one hundred supplementary situation is rather serious.
After the more optimistic perspectives of the spring and the summer last, families are once again more pessimistic quant has their financiere situation.
For next year, the majority of the population envisage a worsening and only a dixieme envisages an improvement of situation.
Last December, 71 for one one hundred polled persons, has to know a majority never seen during the previous opinion polls of Gallup Poll, judged that the prime minister did his job rather badly than definitely.
13 for hundred polling trust or a lot of trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 for one hundred support Viktor Orbán.
54 for one hundred trust in no way in the prime minister and 27 for one hundred to the president of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change of political situation is the proportion of the society thinking that discontent vis-a-vis of the prime minister can etre treated without change of government.
While apres riots of last October, 35 for hundred polling wished that the government and the prime minister stay in function, nowadays this rate represents only 20 for one hundred. Simple majority (33 for one hundred) think that the keeping of new elections would be resolution has this situation.
In the question concerning the intention of vote, 60 for hundred polling answer that they indeed would go to vote and 20 for one one hundred supplementary say that they would go probably to vote.
To make comparison, for " legislative elections to organize next Sunday ", only 55 for hundred polling would indeed participate and 15 for one one hundred supplementary would participate probably. According to actual intentions, the result of referendum would make no doubt.
74 for hundred people would say not in registration fees in higher education, 79 for one hundred would say not at the expense of consultation and 84 for one hundred would say not at the expense of stay has the hospital.

Auchan is the dearest, Tesco augmented the prices of pres of twenty for one hundred
Supermarkets established in the commercial triangle of Budaörs supported the medium increase of the prices of 16 for one hundred years derniere has difference that this year the rate of VAT did not augment.
Article of Napi Gazdaság (daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the Basket of habitual daily Christmas also augmented 16 for one hundred on average, an increase of the distinctly upper value has one thousand forints was displayed in all supermarkets.
Prices, « which had déja flown off » in the department stores of feeding last December, did not augment any more roughly by report has the previous well brought up foundation.
However, the consumers are of course shocked to see that articles bought distinctly under nine thousand forints the year derniere coutent now more than ten forints thousand.
The daily Basket in the polled supermarkets exceeded forints 91, at the very least, the psychological threshold of ten forints thousand.
And the most well brought up value of the basket came has 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6 800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and living fish remained practically at the level of the year derniere, however the prices of the net of turkey, the walnut and the poppy hard augmented.
In stores, the price of the flour and the bread followed the data of KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, to Auchan, they found of some bread of a kilogram has 139 forints only.
Competition did not lower the price of the product under 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this supermarket, that the price of the bottle recorded by two litres of Coca-Cola was under 200 forints, it not coutait therefore only 257 forints the bottle recorded there consisted of.
It empeche only this year, in term of daily Basket, Auchan was the dearest and least dear Cora.
Of apres our counting, Cora augmented the price of his daily Basket of 15 for one hundred while Tesco and Auchan augmented them respectively about 18 and 18 for one hundred.
By comparing the dearest basket of the derniere year and the least dear basket of this year, we determine a distance of 12 for one hundred while difference enters least a lot of the derniere year and the dearest of this year is 21 for one hundred.
Prices augmented forints 1 480 on average.
The derniere year, prices augmented 1 206 forints on average, while knowing that the impact of the increase of the rate of VAT was made déja pointed out in the Christmas prices of last year.
This process made trade perplexed, supermarkets could not determine obviously which margin to apply to products so much they were unable to envisage the impact of the change of prices on consumption.
(If a dealer calculates the rotation of a product badly, he risks losing a big benefit on the adapted margin has the intensity of trade.)
Because of the change of the rate of VAT, the increase in prices of the daily Basket evolved of so extreme maniere that the dearest basket was superior of forints 1 720 has the value of that of 2006 while the difference between the least dear baskets was only forints 844.
This year, difference was not so extreme since the value of the dearest basket was superior of forints 1 630 has that of the derniere year and prices of the least a lot augmented forints 1 284 also.
By bringing closer to the two seasons of Christmas, we determined a calamitous increase of prices, in less than 20 months the prices of the articles of daily consumption augmented 30 of more than for one hundred in supermarkets.
(This does not confirm the data of KSH out of necessity: for certain feeding of premiere required, the institute of statistics determined an increase in prices of more than 30 for one hundred in 12 months.
Such is case for instance of the flour and the egg.)
According to the daily Basket of this last, this seems quasi absurd since the valuable level of this product, déja the derniere year very a lot, augmented of feel a pain more than 10 for one hundred by report has the foundation.
According to indications, the purveyors of flour occupy a stronger position than the purveyors of eggs because they succeeded has make accept the violent increase of prices also by the multinational.
In the triangle of commercial gold, supermarkets do not complain, they always record good years.
Of apres our experiments, the majority of the customers look no more at prices in the three visited supermarkets.
They achetent everything in quantity, they take the food of long conservation by palettes.
On Wednesday morning the important tails formed in the cases of the three supermarkets because the number of customers augmented shortly.
And, according to our information, the turnover is less important in province, of numerous multinational aupres of the societies of opinion poll of no complain meme no attain the envisaged turnover, not only for feeding but also for articles of lasting consumption.
Numerous hospitals make economy on antiseptics
This year, more than one thousand infections, caused in most cases by the wrong use of antibiotics, was recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the deficient number of beds, the overwork of the medical personnel do not help has block infections, asserts the chief doctor of the national Centre of the epidemiology.
Numerous hospitals also make economy on antiseptics
Not for long an infection MRSA was diagnosed in service of traumatologie of the hospital János.
The microbe resistant to antibiotics was discerned on a hospitalized man suite has a serious accident.
The sick man was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the meme place.
The injured man of a serious car accident went out of the hospital but not enough apres time he has of go back owing to an infection MRSA there and, since, the doctors could not make him an important operation has reason of the microbe which is in its organism.
Until December 10th of this year, 1 094 infections hospitalieres generated by an agent pathogene multiresistant were declared in national Systeme of nosocomiale surveillance, pointed out Karolina Böröcz, chief doctor of the national Centre of the epidemiology.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by an agent pathogene multiresistant which was indeed recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, in other words by resistant staphylococcus aureus has the méthicilline-oxacilline.
A third of people is bearing of the microbe of Staphylococcus aureus (HER) in the noses without it develops an illness.
Infections caused by HER (such as anginas, tonsillitises, cutaneous infections, traumatic infections) react well to antibiotics, they are easily urable.
However, if antibiotics are used of extreme or dissociable maniere, the microbe, who reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a microbe very resistant to antibiotics which will proliferate fast in poor hospitalieres conditions.
In case of poor functioning interim or extended by the immune systeme, this microbe can cause hospitalieres serious infections, such as traumatic infection or septicemia, on the old sick, of small weights or having a weakened organism.
According to the guiding doctor of the hospital János, there is nothing particular in infections MRSA, these infections are part of the daily of hospitals.
You should not especially merge the infection with the epidemic, they do not find MRSA only or they do not search them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
HER resist to antibiotics.
" These sick are isolated, the treating personnel puts rubber gloves and masks of protection and we have antibiotics adapted to treat on them ", declared Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, the hospitalized sick are examined if they are bearing of MRSA, nevertheless the infection always cannot etre avoided.
The prélevement of the sample is not has fashion
The great majority of infections caused by MRSA could etre told but conditions and actual circumstances are not favourable, in the Hungarian hospitals, to tell development and proliferation of the pathogenes multiresistant agents, asserts Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection manifests itself especially in hospitals and in residences for old persons, hospitals should control the hospitalized sick and to isolate the ill holders of MRSA immediately.
Nevertheless the microbiological prélevement is not has fashion in the Hungarian hospitals.
It is necessary to know that the national Case of French national health and pensions organization does not finance these exams.
The most part of cases come into the world only if the infection MRSA is detectable on the sick man, declared the chief doctor of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has relating strict recommendations has the use adapted by some antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian directives also for the healing of certain infections and syndromes.
It is necessary to make efforts so that the therapy antibiotic is targeted, in other words microbiological exams should etre accomplished to empecher the resistance to medicaments but hospitals still do not take into account it.
The realization of the microbiological prélevements is even rarer in ambulant care and in basic care, announced Karolina Böröcz.
Numerous hospitals make economy on antiseptics
Scientific proof shows that MRSA proliferent of a sick man has other one it more often through the medical personnel.
It is therefore primordial to wash his hands, to put gloves and masks of protection. Nevertheless important lacunas are discerned in hospitals also in this domain.
MRSA proliferent by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, owing to conditions in the Hungarian hospitals, the polluted sick man always cannot etre isolated.
Besides, rooms are often full, beds are often too much pres to some of the others while in term of epidemic, the sick should etre moved away some of the others d ' metres 1,5 at the very least.
Unfortunately, we also note that hospitals, in financiere difficult situation, make savings on antiseptics, they lack infirmieres, the sick are numerous, so the risk of pollution is even bigger, pointed out Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is weaker of demonstrable maniere or then the proliferation of the agent pathogene can blocked etre.
Governmental plan against MRSA
The treatment of the infection MRSA represents exorbitant expenses for the cases of French national health and pensions organization, that's why they struggle against this infection everywhere.
In England, for instance, the government established a program to tell or diminish the impact of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is efficient and infections MRSA show a diminishing tendency in England.
The European Centre of prevention and control of diseases (ECDC) shows among its preferences the prevention of the impact of the pathogenes multiresistant agents (as MRSA also) as well as prevention of infections hospitalieres caused by these pathogenes agents.

Key Political: the Hungarian Nurse augmented risk country
According to Division analyse last aout of risk of Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division), the activity of the Hungarian Nurse, constituted there, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for better Hungary) augments, under several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and region.
In its « warning of risk », the society signals that, in touch with the activity of the Hungarian Nurse, the biggest political risk am déja that « short term of aggressive ethnic clashes has be able to occur suite has the worsening of the ethnic existent tension déja between the not Gypsy and Gypsy population of Hungary ».
The research institute added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Nurse aiming probably has cause this situation main reason is.
As they say, it explains by one of the main lacunas of the Hungarian political actors: « the public actors crossed relating public debate has the affair of Roms to the representatives of radical political groupings and extremes who based a political strategy on disagreement between the gypsies and the Hungarians ».
The probleme thinks there it is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, the extremists see themselves reinforced and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more probable, they say.
And, according to the research institute, under the influence of the attention augmented by Hungarian and international mass media the activity of the Hungarian Nurse « damaged the picture of Hungary significantly has the foreigner, particularly concerning the trust in stability and democratic adulthood of the country ».
They say that, suite has a bigger given advertising has the reorganization of the radical groups and extremes rights Hungarian since autumn on 2006, numerous associations were constituted in Hungary since summer, 2007 giving the name of ' « national association of self-defence ».
« The common trait of this gathering is that they define themselves as a civil organization while they declare the preparation of their followers publicly has missions of defence (disasters, national defence, defence of order), armed if it is needed, moreover, by recalling the disability of the police, the army, in other words the state », they added.
They signalled that everything took place according to the method which, by being based on the rancour of the society of policy and parties, searches has dress up different political ambition under a civil aspect.
The accent put on the civil caractere and the status of association serves therefore only only has avoid the juridical pieges of the recording of these associations in the court but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis signals that the activity of the Hungarian Nurse is a factor who also augments risk in comparison with the relations of neighbourhood.
« These last months, numerous neighbouring countries name the Hungarian Nurse as a potential source of risk and the ultranationalist political actors of certain bordering countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring has the constitution of the Hungarian Nurse.
This influences the political stability of the region », they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Nurse is not an unique phénomene in Eastern central Europe, political risks augmented on the whole region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Nurse resembles, for instance, has the activity of the Bulgarian national Nurse whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian national Union (BNU) in aout on 2007.
Numerous disturbances of Roms which burst in a quarter of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are has the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian nurse.
By using these events, BNU decided to constitute a nurse by saying that the objective of the organization is national self-defence ".
According to them, this 17 dernieres years, Romany "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state remained inactive and neutral, reminds of Political Capital.
They added that initiative had provoked deep debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement of certain Bulgarian organizations of Roms concerning the constitution of their own nurse by way of resistance signals the increase of the risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Nurse showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian national Nurse not excluded not only Hungarian Roms react has the threat of the meme maniere by organizing their own self-defence, they can read in the warning of risk of Political Capital.
At the request of information of the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, head of research of Key Political, said: the analysis of risk is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their analysis of risk is published every year and if events occurred who could have an impact on the change of risk, they inform public opinion about it, as in this case, by publishing a warning of risk.
The fete is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, law defines the days of fete exactly and, around fetes, he became common to reorganize the working days by which the number will diminish next year.
Fetes is not uniform in the EU and in the United States either.
Hungarian legislation differentiates the days of national fete and state as well as the days of repose.
The days of repose are often linked has religious fetes or has important historical events.
In Hungary, we fetons the new year, last day of the year which ends and the first day of the new year are also days of repose, this last all the more so that réveillonneurs can have a rest easy.
Moreover, in year, we have in very eleven fetes marked in red.
March 15th is a national fete, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as October 23rd also which is the memorial day of the revolution of 1956.
20 aout, we fetons the constitution of our state, the May 1st is the fete of job and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember members of our family and of our died friends.
Besides, we have two days has Easter, has Whitsunday and has Christmas.
The days of our fetes of state, national or else religious seldom falling over weekend, according to the calendar, it became common to reorganize working days in cases either he stays only a working day before or apres the fete marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of the extended weekends by working or leaving has the school the Saturday preceding the extended weekend.
Many long years, Minister of Employment gives a ruling in a particuliere regulation on the days of replacement of preceding days or according to fetes.
Law stretches for all employers and for all their used wage earners, on the civil servants and on the persons working in the public service.
It is not however worth for the societies of services, institutions turning ceaselessly and in service, all over their vocation, and also for the days of repose.
This year, working days will be only changed around the fetes of end of the year: has leave of December 24th, the life arrete practically in all country because according to experiments the majority of people make overtime rather or go on holiday that they economized has these aims to be able to spend days between Christmas and in the daytime of the new year to them.
Next year a lot fetes fall in the middle or has the end of the week, as a result there will be fewer changes at the level of working days by report has this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the premiere time around the fete of job to allow the wage earners to stay at home four days of sharpening.
On Saturday, April 25th will be one working day to have a day of repose on Friday, May 2nd.
Another change is envisaged by October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th a working day replacing the Friday, 24 will be.
On the other hand, next year, end of the year is brewing under the sign of fetes because has leave of December 24th, everybody will make a pause non-stop meme if the day of the new year falls over Wednesday.

If you want to answer wait, you are not interesting any more
They advance slowly in the habitual cork of morning.
Everything has blow, a particuliere melody makes heard itself hear has the radio: the voice of a violin has which electronic effects are linked.
I take up sound.
Music changes rhythm and the low arrives to accompany tones of very has the hour, then a female choir comes to join it as a true jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts the song Wings of Coil of Zagar.
Hungarian musical life did not spoil us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
And, now it seems that the cork alters if you listen to the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, some new interesting productions born in the Hungarian numerical underground begin not much has not much has change the picture of group and, in spite of the new fashion of the rock of garage tearing the guitar, the Hungarian électropop proves that there is the new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played him - meme in the group of Yonderboi before he launches on the own way, can - etre because « there has not place as two feet in a meme footwear ».
Its plan (Zagar) and its music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dancing music and pop, began has make know when they entrusted him the composition of filmed soundtracks (for example.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The training playing at the beginning in small clubs began etre known by one more has general public when the magazine wan2 named their first album of 2002 among the fifty more important discs of the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the Hungarian quasi alone creative of tendency who would be also competitive has the west.
Zagar and the group became irrefutably "Trendy" but nobody asked them if they definitely wanted to carry this tab.
The group reacted properly, he took out a new and better disc.
The called album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, taken out newly, can open new ways for them, although title wants to represent a continuity with last years has Pécs.
It is because it was a line of the ancient group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are on good terms there the reference to theft but has side of air music impact of rock and roll appears, according to mind and tendency of epoch, stronger guitar now.
György Ligeti, singer working in England with the group The Puzzle nowadays, shows its talent in these songs during the premiere of the album in the Park millennium.
On the album, they find a true tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, broadcasting popular music lately from morning till evening, began has introduce the melodies of Wings of Coil recorded with six Hungarian singers (" Underground Divas ").
Everything goes very therefore (?).
hvg.hu asked questions has Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me has ask a question: did your music definitely remain a music aiming at a certain coat?
Zságer Balázs: Aiming music term a certain coat does not say to me big thing.
For me there are two cliques in légere music; no mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and music sincere.
Musics one saying alternative, underground can etre also mediocre and made only to sell them and become so commercial.
And, a good song pop can etre sincere also.
The attitude of reception works in this mind also independently of the language or the frontieres.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between public Hungarian and foreign, the one or other one is more opened has your music?
Zs. B.: Abroad, especially légere has the west music has older traditions.
People go years to concerts and not only young persons of a dozen or about twenties but also the oldest.
They follow with much more attention changes happened in légere music because they think that she is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your job?
Are you interested to know which, or and how many persons listen to your music?
Zs. B.: I am of course happy to see that people come more and more numerous has our concerts.
However we have never played music for the market.
For us music is not made to reach a target but for a definite reason.
The role of the public is more important in concerts or mutual influence works déja but it is perceptible only in the intangible changes of instant.
And, I pointed out that if you wanted to answer wait of the public, you will not be interesting any more.
hvg.hu: Do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made carriere rather has the west.
Zs. B.: We really do not follow his way meme if sometimes some people try to find traces in our music.
We are rather players in team who trust in the musical presence of other one and let her fan out.
At the beginning, it was definitely on unavoidable that our music is compared has that of Yonderboi because we are several has leave his group and has take another way.
hvg.hu: On the palmares of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Coils occupy the premiere put.
Numerous are those who heard the name of Zagar for the premiere time by means of this song.
With this more popular style you opened consciously towards a broader coat?
Zs. B.: We did not plan to make a tube to be able to sell the disc.
This song wants to tell more things.
We wanted it for finale of the album to try to soften the bacchanal of sounds and the more difficult themes approached in all disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - which was the guiding line?
Zs. B.: Idea was to have a choir of type gospel song.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists of the Hungarian musical scene.
So was composed the choir has six members, has know Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik õ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, whom they called then Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: You wanted this song just like that or the girls changed it a bit?
Zs. B.: This piece existed déja for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that it still missed something has this song.
The suite of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang meme night the melody which the girls learnt later.
I had it almost right away and everything was terrifically unprompted.
I remember that it galvanized me has the epoch but definitely sure we needed Divas.
With my voice it would have had no meme force.
hvg.hu: On the disc and in the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were there arriere plan.
There is not solo (has the exception of a short solo of Judy Jay), they do not have role alone, they sing very together and they do not sing more extremely than music, therefore music does not make that to accompany their singing.
They were derriere on the scene also.
Is it wanted?
Zs. B.: The fact that they were arriere there plan is of only has technical problemes.
On the contrary, what was volunteer, it is that we did not want to distribute soloist's roles.
The song also says that we must forget our ego a bit, forget which comes of or, which goes or, it is just necessary to leave that these wings, the wings of love, take us.
I wanted the others to feel also this ecstatic state which we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which songs made you most work?
Zs. B.: In actual fact, no as for the process of musical creation, us has more difficult pieces during mixture.
For instance, with Dorian Gray s Dilemma, either I play has a concert grand, or with Rock not Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove did not want to work for a long time, and then, baby has baby, everything put on in place as in a jigsaw puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your preferring on the new album?
Zs. B.: This changes with concerts at all times and due to the fact that I have déja "dropped" this disc.
At present, these are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The perfidious tradeur risked billions because of its inferiority complex
A secretive impostor.
So indicate his ancient employee the French giant the general Society, owner of the Czech bank Komerčn í banka.
The bank lost because of him about five billion euro.
And it seems rather than Kerviel is only a big player who wanted to equate his colleagues, and who, on top of that, can be considered not at all as unable.
Contrary to all big houses of bank, it acknowledged the crisis of the American market of mortgages on time.
" It is fragile ", his superiors gave to understand who reported it to the police.
However, if they are held in the deposition of Kerviel brought back by the French mass media, of which The World, the transactions of this man produced at the turn of the last year a benefit coming to 1,6 billion euro.
Crisis exceeds the United States
" All that I wanted, it was to earn some silver for my bank ", he asserts in deposition.
Last summer, it succeeded in using American crisis to earn a half billion euro.
In fact, he smelt opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began appearing in February according to which said mortgages "sub-bonus", granted to customers with weak income or with those who had met in the past of difficulties of refund, would have of problems.
But this crisis should not have an influence on the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe in it and he bet well.
So, at the turn of the year, his benefits came to 1,6 billion euro.
" As soon as I had earned my first half billion, I did not know how to announce it ", entrusts Kerviel and adds that he kept nothing, of course, for himself. "
In all cross-examination, he confesses to have distorted reports not to be deflected.
It succeeded in deceiving his superiors, although the grant Eurex begins being interested in its transactions.
Which risks nothing has anything
Did he fear being discovered?
Rather no.
" I thought that simple fact to have acquired 1,6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them. "
Where from comes his will to risk so big?
It reached its post only progressively.
It had begun working at the General Societ in 2000 just after having finished its studies in the University of Lyons.
His annual wage turned around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, he has already been helper of tradeur and, in 2005, he became tradeur independent with an annual 90 thousand dollar wage.
However, he knew that he would never win as much as the others.
" From my first maintenance in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
With regard to my university programme and with my " professional and personal course, specifies to the interviewers Kerviel.
And, shortly after his taken up the post, it carries off its first big success.
Thanks to actions Allianz, it earned a half billion euro by betting on the fall of this title during the murder attempts of London.
And the mechanism was triggered off - he wanted more.
As long as you win, they leave you in peace
" There was as an effect snowball ", he said to the policemen.
But the superiors knew about everything, or rather, they suspected it.
" As long as I won, they pretended to close eyes. "
And, it is while the blow of the beginning of the year happens.
It loses a billion euro in one day.
In mid-January, after weekend, it decides to eclipse sum.
On Monday, when it arrives at job, it is not any more used of the bank.
Some days afterwards, the bank announces that it lost 5 billion euro because of him.
And how they discovered it?
It became suspicious because of its leaves.
" Last year, I took leaves only 4 days.
A trader which does not go on holiday is a trader which does not want to leave its book to other one ", concludes Kerviel.
Tchéquie has opportunity to acquire 365 billions
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed nine operational programs in all with representatives of the European Commission, who could, in years to come, bring 14 billion euro (about 365 billion Czech crowns) in the Czech Republic.
It is almost about the half of the entirety of sum which Tchéquie can acquire from Brussels in 2007s in 2013.
About 125 billion existent crowns of seven operational programs will be intended for the Czech regions.
The Czech firms will be able to acquire about 100 billion crowns as part of program Firm and innovation.
The area of transport will benefit from the biggest part, up to 150 billions.
Transport program is the most important operational program and represents until 22 for hundred financial means that Czech Rép. can acquire as part of these plans.
This silver will be at the origin of an increase in the budget of the national Bottom of the facilities of the transport which is going to manage next year a sum of 90,8 billion crowns.
Firm program and innovation, intended for SMES and for businessmen, must serve for acquiring medium financiers to encourage innovation within the firm.
Firms should acquire medium financiers for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new more efficient methods of management.
Until now, Czech Rép. was part, among the new members, of beneficiaries of the funds of The EU least crowned with success.
The Court confirmed the trouble of 20 years of prison for the ex-president of Nicaragua
The Court Of appeal of Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the trouble of 20 years of prison for the ancient president of the country Arnold Alemán, for whom it was condemned in 2003 for a 100 million dollar fraud (about 1,8 billion crowns).
And, later he was liberated and lived Nicaragua allocated to residence in his hacienda near the capital of.
If the ancient leader from this State centre-American, in function between 1997 and 2002, will be or not again encarcéré is, according to the agency AP, not clearly for the time being.
According to the chairwoman of the Court Of appeal Ileana Pérez, everything is now going to depend on agents of prison, or they will let Aleman finish the trouble to him, or will go to prison once again.
4 years ago, the Court proved that Alemán moved the silver of the government regularly towards count of foreign societies in Panama.
It was about fictitious societies and count belonged in reality to the members of his family and to his closest supporters.
A party of this silver goes to the funds which Alemán had created to finance the election campaign in 2001.
They adopted the budget
It is so.
The state budget was adopted.
In what is this budget special?
It is the first budget conceived by this government and accepted by the governmental majority without supports it of opposition.
That for ongoing year is crossed one year ago thanks to support of the Czech socialist party - ČSSD, since it is the minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford his refusal.
Contrary to the agitated debate preceding the vote of the statement of distrust in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies adopted without any problem this law which, although the most influential, is ordinarily neglected.
Here is a kind of paradox.
That they want it or not, every chapter and every article constitute the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget leaves constituent of policy, though eclipsed behind the competition of power comparing government and opposition.
This last is more delightful médiatiquement and it is for this that they grant him more attention in mass media.
Disputes of the politicians interest much more opinion than figures abrupt.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from wrong three that the actual budget is not capable to regulate at the same time:
The first being the important part granted at the expense of mandates imposed by law, constituted not only by retirement, but also by welfare costs, adopted the last year by the silent "alliance" regrouping parties ČSSD and KSČM.
The second being an economy showing a deficit, consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle, shone, is constituted by the deficit of public finances, i.e. by the deficit of cities and villages.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the biggest vagary.
This one am public and comparatively under control.
The true time bomb, it is the deficit of cities and villages.
Many mayors often issued, there dazed, of obligations, putting into debt their municipalities excessively, to acquire, put to one side the silver coming from levies, from tax laws and from credits of bank, from new sources of investment.
In last years, they succeeded in reimbursing these debts by sale as a whole actions of the systems of distribution, notably those of energy, acquired from the State as part of privatizations.
Today, they have not this souce any more.
If they are only held in official and verifiable facts, they note that:
Our economy crosses already for several years, very as the rest of the world, a stage of growth and ČSSD does not miss to be blowing there.
It was an unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
And, instead of it, they put into debt the State more and more.
Other countries, put to one side some exceptions as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, managed their business in a much more reasonable manner than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame which falls again principally on the previous governments.
We are part of countries which, in the total ladder, are the least threatening by poverty.
We have therefore no need of massive social programs which, precisely these last years, unfortunately in vain rose.
Although they succeed in abolishing a party of the absurd populist expenses, approved the year crossed before elections, if a gap of the border of age for retirement, as well as a reform of the system of retirement will not take place, then shortly any policy will cease existing in this country and whoever will be in power, it will be only managing.
In éxagérant barely, they can say that the politicians in power will become distributing bureaucrats méchaniquement the majority of the silver imposed between retirement and social benefits.
It is the reason for which the actual budget cannot be revolutionary, but he can only suspend the mechanism which makes that ordinary expenses are pushed back by expenses of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billions envisaged for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not dispelled all silver that they could.
If we really do not want it to happen that policies in power become simple bureaucrats, it is necessary us to be patient and to grant in this fragile, aware governmental alliance that the State can spend only the equivalent of what it succeeds in taking of a sample in levies and in tax laws, the peace necessary for the preparation of new laws of reform.
There are only these last which will allow to attain a balanced state budget progressively.

Banks want to regulate crisis
The federal Bank of American reservation, the European central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks decided to fight together the crisis of financial markets.
More than hundred billion dollars will so be put on money markets by the intermédiare of auction.
It will be for the banks to sell rates of interest, by a system of auction, auquels they are ready to borrow some silver.
As an example, the American EDF is going to send 40 billion dollars by auction and, besides, it will provide 24 billions the European and Swiss central Banks.
It is the first time since the attacks of 11. in September when the central Banks of individual States decided on an action in this point planed, aiming at preventing, or even diminishing the effects of financial crisis.
" This step tends to regulate the major problems of economy, to know the lack growing by free capitals which banks could lend ", writes in his report to the customers Bernard Baumohl of the society of advice Economic Outlook Group.
" The action planed by the central Banks diminished the likelihood of a recession in the United States of 65 for one hundred in about 50 for one hundred ", adds Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost 60 billion dollars because of the not reimbursed loans, especially in the United States.
The analysts still wait for other losses in billions.
" If the central Banks chose this step, it is that they have to arrest indeed what can again follow ", says the chief economist of the ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
" It seems that situation is really poor ", he adds.
The central Banks fear that, if banks will have a difficult access to loans themselves, they are going to cause their customers more a lot.
This would diminish consumption and plunge American economy into a recession that can have an influence on the economic fast growth of the whole world.
The central Banks made this choice after they did not succeed in bringing down the interbank rate of London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
What meant that banks always feared the mutual borrowing, even though the American, Canadian and English central Banks diminish their rates of interests again and again, during autumn.
" It will have the same effect as a news lowers rates of interests ", said in the agency Reuters Greg Salvaggio of the society Tempus Consulting.
Certain analysts do not think that the step of the central Banks will contribute not to stave off crisis, since it does not regulate the main problem which is the fall of the property market in USAS.
The president Klaus: debates of the environmentalists are unconvincing
Total climatic changes are being supposed to do harm developing countries especially.
The president Václav Klaus again pronounced on the problems of planetary warming.
Criticism beat down on the international conference of United Nations on the climatic changes this time finishing in Bali.
In Vienne, where it introduced its book The blue planet, not green, it enunciated that debates of the environmentalists were unconvincing.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of conference, constituted by a mixture curious for representatives of governments and from non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference which there is between the rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
" Debate is not structured of the whole there, it is only a missile of words, ersatz of resolutions in actual problems ", said Klaus.
The Czech president underlined, during the presentation of his book, that his subject has a big importance as him and it is for it that he gets involved so much for this reason.
It also demonstrated its contentment of the fact that its book also appears in German translation, since, he said, " I often meet only the caricature of my opinions ".
Consequently, the interested persons can read his positions without their being distorted.
Klaus said that although he is not climatologist, he has enough dispositions however, to his opinion, to write such book.
It is in effect an academician able of following and appreciating scientific treaties, it has the practice of statistics and he is also economist.
Major conclusions of the book are, according to him, following theses: climate evolves continuously, the changes of this one are therefore normal, there is not an opinion shared by all researchers on planetary warming, the effects of actual changes are not either too important or too serious, they represent no danger therefore and, finally, efforts led to influence the evolution of climate are useless, ineffectual and inacceptablement costly.
Especially since having the experience of a totalitarian regime, it considers as unacceptable to impose invérifiées opinions in the others, what he feels as a dangerous attack in freedom.
In reply to the questions of the present persons, he explained again and again that he was not against " a reasonable protection of environment, but against a fundamentalist environnementalisme which does not take into consideration relation between expenses and benefit which they bring ".
In Vienne, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago, in the institute Hayek.

The price of the substitution of the children: 12 millions
The lawyer of the stricken families Igor Veleba wants to acquire from the hospital of Třeb í  an indemnification of 12 million crowns more expenses.
Three millions for each of the mothers, two millions for the fathers and a million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200.000 for each of the parents.
That's why the lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál absolutely does not agree with the proposal of Veleba.
" We refuse such claim, this one is very very well brought up ", said Dostál at the exit of audience.
" To be in even to form an opinion on the contreproposition, we need expert's report the opposite party of which ordered the writing.
We are going to prove if this one has some explicative value.
But we continue thinking that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands ", underlined Dostál.
Sum should, according to him, be fixed between 100.000 and 200.000 K č for each of four parents.
At the beginning of affair, the family of Jabloňov asked for a million crowns for every month when she could not bring up her biological daughter.
Veleba used expert's report, written for him by the teaching hospital in Prague-Motol, as of a document in the support for the negotiations of indemnification.
According to the experts in psychology and in psychiatry, the parents were subjected to a psychological damage and being subject to stress with different ladders and depths.
The situation of stress was better supported by the men, although they are confronted in remorse not to have known how to prevent the substitution of the new - born.
The women, them, remain less serene in front of the living of traumatism in actuality and in front of what takes place precisely at present, summed up the contents of the report Veleba.
Veronika and Nikola were substituted by nurses for the hospital of Třeb í  on December 9th of this year.
Last week, children went back at their biological parent's - Nikola to Čermák to Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Bro ž and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the region Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil delayed 100.000 crowns, at the end of October, in each of the families for the refund of expenses caused by the error of the hospital of Třeb í  managed by the region.
All hospitals in Tchéquie are compelled by law to insurance in civil liability.
In case of breach, they have to scoop out in the bottom of reservation, unusually, they can ask for the help to the manager.

Polívka lost Valašské Královstv í (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost litigation about mark Valašské královstv í (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it is really it which had used title for the first time king de Valašsko, but plan was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the ancient collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's audience.
And, according to his lawyer, affair is not probably finished and his customer will call.
" Litigation concerns the fact that Mr Harabiš and its team parasitize on the popularity of Bolek Polívka, " said after trial the lawyer of Polívka.
According to him, words Kingdom of Valašsko recall everybody precisely this actor and comic actor.
Harabiš thinks the same.
" There is a job of almost ten years behind us.
Of research of silver and bet so as to events " he said.
According to him, it is the silver which is the reason of litigation.
" After years, they realized that plan has success and that they could take advantage from it.
It is them who want to parasitize on our job ", he added.
A profitable business
According to the court, it is Polívka which used for the first time valašsk title ý král (king de Valašsko) in her television program.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohat ý had crowned it king in 1993.
And, in epoch, it did not have report with plan to set up a fictitious kingdom.
Some years later, Harabiš came with the idea of publishing passports of Valašské Královstv í.
Of a humorous action in origin he went out of it a business and a profitable commercial activity, followed by creation, by Harabiš, of the society Valašské královstv í.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that the name and the signature are named in the passport and he even offered to the holders of balances on the price of the visit of his farm and of his shows of theatre.
Who is going to sit down on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš was only using the bare idea, published by Polívka in the program mané ž, for commercial aims.
" The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainemement helped Valašské královstv plan í, " says the judge.
She added however that the soul of plan was constituted by Harabiš and its team which dedicated itself to plan in a intense way.
The collaboration between parties today enemy continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began piling up between Polívka has Harabiš, which culminated with deposition " of the 1st king Boleslav elected forever ".
The role aiming in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, taken by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka lodged a complaint against Harabiš and the society, request that the court has rejected today.
What could get the bottom of affair, it is the tournament envisaged for the throne and a half of the princess.
He should take out a new king from it.
He did not yet want to betray details and date.
" We do not want to go quickly to work.
this would be quelquechose as the parade of the kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for certain time.
The same mister Polívka can naturally register ", added Harabiš.
Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: diparition of prejudices
In actual fact, I have never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
His qualities of rotation were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the gears, of behaviour and also that of manufacture could, in a lot of respect, be qualified of lower in average.
And, nowadays there is on the market his successor Peugeot 207 who, it, is distinctly better.
Especially since the combi named SW goes another step farther, I do not have more than to think better.
When I tested the classical hatchback of Peugeot 207 I complained for instance about the space for the head on the posterior seats.
While there finished complaints because the bodywork combi means that even the big demons will be comfortable, in this respect.
Let us be going to see quickly made
I am very fast going to recall inside not to repeat me too much.
It is about a design almost successful, my the only remark concerning the central tunel which seems to me poor.
There, I would have liked a little more inventive design, given that the car looks so smart.
Seats are comfortable and epoch when they could complain of seats or about too short files is past.
Lateral guidance also distinctly improved in comparison with the model 206.
As for the space, the increase of the dimensions of the bodywork is sensitive also there.
The combi sees disappearing also the lack of place above the head already mentioned.
A chest in the chest
The most important on this vehicle, it is therefore its soutte with baggages.
I must assess this one as very well approachable (also thanks to the back swivel ice) and of a rather easy stowing.
The blind areas are provided with rubber bands of stopping which constitute an ideal compromise.
He is not bulky and can be spread while being able of holding asez heavy objects.
But let us stop at us in the volume.
This one makes, according to pictures, 428 l in basic shape, what is in comparison with competition a figure rather medium.
Bet apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, transport most sold by this category in Tchéquie.
If they compare 207 SW with the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, they note that Peugeot stays very emotionally, difference behind being 52 litres.
When it is a question of leaving in leaves abroad or of loading a stroller, this figure is quasi critic.
But, if I had to bring to light advantages, I would mention the underside of case remaining after the inversion of the files of pillions perfectly right, or a step very low.
120 horses divided on four cylinders
The car that we made out a will was equipped with a motor Otto of four cylinders with a volume of 1,6 l and a potency of 88 kW.
And in actual fact, it is it that should resemble one 1,6 who gets to work a family hatchback.
It is silent, consumes not much and, especially, he grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda which often gives impression to have a pot of exhaust blocked by a serpillère, then I can be enthusiast there only.
Let us go through rates
The price of the vehicle is not accessible by all.
However, they must be aware that they tested a well enough equipped car, with an ample inside and a very good motor.
The basic price of a vehicle with a motor Otto 1,4 litres coming to 329 900 K č is still fairly good.
The vehicle which we tested costs from 410 900 K č, what is already enough.
The equipment Premium, also tested, augments the price of 80 000 K č.
And, we disposed besides air bags head, of an automatic air-conditioning, essuis-ice automatic, of an automatic order of windows rears...
In reality, the vehicle costs 531 900 K č in the last analysis.
It is a lot, but try to add the additional equipment by dint of Fabia and you will acquire a very similar figure.
It therefore does not remain more than to choose mark.
The incorporation of the Slovak pupils in britaniques schools carries badly
The number of children native to countries of Eastern Europe in britaniques schools goes growing, what causes at the demeurants of anxiety about the evolution of local education.
The incorporation of the Eastern Europeans collides with a series of obstacles, at the moment.
Britaniques schools determine cases even where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the inhabitants of origin are transformed into acts of violence.
The case of Kent of the north, where begin becoming more marked opposing demeurants conflicts and immigrants of Slovak origin famous good the problem of the incorporation of the children native to Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicane and fights between the pupils transposed in relations between the parents.
Situation went so far as the police stopped in Chatham a Slovak woman who hit with an iron bar a pupil agé of ten years.
The culprit defends herself by maintaining that the boy had insulted it by purposes rasistes.
The police must also have intervened further to the attack against a Slovak immigrant led by two teenagers.
The girls had addressed to this man of racist comments and had thrown him some stones.
" When they came back the home, a young person climbed the stopping of bus and began spitting us out over.
When I told him to stop, he answered by apples and of pears and then he discovered the backside ", represented another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak pupils.
Complaints are formulated by both parties.
One of the demeurants went to the point of qualifying conflicts with the immigrants of conflict for survival.
Cases recalled more high manifest that the atmosphere in schools britaniques between the inhabitants of origin and the immigrants begins being tightened.
70 thousand Slovaks come to find job are recorded in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak pupils see frequently britaniques schools.
Cuba, the nicest island of Caribbean
For the visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
All that you wait for your leaves can come true if you make a good choice.
Beaches gold and snow-white, high waves or then a sea tranquilizes as a pond.
Palms and the inclusive all with waiters giving you on the beach a pizza, of the ice or the intoxicating cocktails.
The kitesurfing, golf and the castor.
On the islands of the sea of Caraîbes, you are not going to find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
And, there is only the single island on which you will find even much more and it is Cuba, the biggest and nicest island of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been bastion of their plague of America.
Christopher Columbus qualified it as the nicest place which the human eye has never seen.
Havana became store and place of transshipment of the treasures which the Spanish had stolen and which they transported in Europe.
Then American epoch came.
Hotel Nacional was established at the very beginning the twenties '.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who made it construct, since all that was a crime in USAS (especially under prohibition) was accepted and supported in Cuba: narcotic, games of chance, prostitution.
Parmis his customers, there was, between others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, buildings in height grew and of cars, belonging in symbols worship of the fifties ' of last century, circulated on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought an ownership in San Fransisco of Paula, near Havana, and, from Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the showbusiness and the politicians of whole America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And today then?
You can leave yourlself your autograph on the walls of Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, they will mix you the cocktail of your choice.
And these cars worship always circulates to Havana, since jigoulis and in the past imported fiats already have rottenness for a long time, in a humid and so salt climate.
Although Havana, especially most ancient party, is emotionally decrepit, nullepart in surroundings elsewhere there are so many monuments colonial splendid which there is precisely there.
Other places become nicer, for instance Trinidad.
Given that tourism brings silver if necessary, its development has green light.
During last fifteen years, new hotels pushed not only in Havana, but also especially to Varader, on the coast of the province Holguín, and also on the small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another fancy which is unique in the world and that will be especially appreciated by the amateurs of small trains.
The cane had come back since plantations spread in sweets on a narrow way by small stream trains and to motor.
Their movable equipment was not renewed during dozens years and that's how they can see there in motion small engines the contemporaries of which are only in museums elsewhere.
Towards where to aim his steps?
The majority of the visitors do not miss the most known places.
It therefore does not need there to write it long on Varadero or on Havana.
Otherwise say that in the ownership of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and what the one who loves this writer should not miss visit.
The valley of Viňales on the West from the island constitutes one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exhubérante vegetation grows to it on a calcareous soil.
Mogotes, calcareous balls and rocks zoom of the bottom of the valley, and, the fecund earth having been taken in their entrails, even his rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is the place where they cultivate probably the Cuban tobacco of the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the plants of cigars of Havana.
Somebody will think perhaps also interesting that it is there that in turned summer the Chilean episode of major Zeman.
Trinidad
Ancient justifiable city shortly after that the Spanish colonizes the island.
It is the market the trade of the slaves and that some sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth was embodied in beauty and character city-window of this city of reduced size.
Koloniáln í španělská architektura, výrazn ě ovlivněná pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky, za čtyři stalet í tém ěř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the chain of mountains Escambray, is a place in such point out of the way as still in the fifties ' of last century, there was not road which would link up this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay aside.
They constructed nothing, and that's why they demolished nothing either, each contented himself with having a roof above the head.
If they have, to Trinidad, more time than an afternoon, then it is worth trouble to go to see interessants places also in surroundings, such as beach Playa Ancón or valley of Sweets.
Then, the evening, it is of usage to go in Put it of Música which becomes lively after the sunset and where music becomes muffled only in the early hours.
Baracoa
Some people indicate this small town located extremely is from Cuba as nicest of the island.
This opinion is indeed influenced already by the way which leads there.
Both roads which lead since Guantánamo there have to cross high and uneven mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO inscribed the reef is from Cuba, thanks to its landscape undamaged, on the list of worldwide heritage.
They fabricate the best chocolate, in the church there, there is the crucifix of Christopher Columbus (in reality, she came into the world almost hundred years after the journey of Colomb) and since the hill where is held ancient chateau-extremely and the actual El Castillo hotel, they see several mountains table, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, about rum, about cigars, about chain of mountains Sierra Maestra, of the Berry of sows and island Isla de Pinos, from the cabaret Tropicana, from the shrine of the patrone saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, Africain religions played by the descendants of the ancient slaves, about all that they could fill a quantity of pages.
Only, as they say precisely, it is better to see once.

And, according to the United States, the allies attained their absolute border and in the organization and in the equipment of troops.
In concrete terms, they ask for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the entrainement of the Afghan troops.
" We shall have to think seriously on concrete objectives for period to come, as well as on ways how attain them ", said Gates.
The general secretary of NATO JAAP DE HOOP has held similar purposes today.
" I am not happy with what we have on earth and in air in Afghanistan.
We have almost ninety as one one hundred soldiers and of equipment which we would need, and it is not enough ", said Of Hoop to the agency Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo which lasted three days.
Which is passive
These last months also reign between countries implicated by conflicts concerning question if all allies really make all their possible in Afghanistan.
For instance Germany was criticized for its passiveness.
" The Germans have in Afghanistan comparatively numerous presentation.
But they are hired in zones where violence is minimal, requirements of battle with which they are subject are not therefore so strict as those in the South parties and the East of the country where we operate ", said Gates.
The tabloid britanique Sun qualified this week the German soldiers as lazy.
" Lazy Afghan discover: the Germans play, while ours fight ", wrote Sun in a document supplemented by photographs of German soldiers playing the tenis of table.
The German newspaper Bild is crossed to the counter-attack by publishing the photograph of britanique troops during a match of rugby in the south party of Afghanistan.

It has compared in front of a court in Khartoum today to have named a plush bear
The British teacher judged in Sudan for insult in Islam was condemned on Thursday evening by a court of Khartoum in 15 days of prison and in expulsion, pointed out her lawyer.
The British woman was accused of having let of the pupils from 6 to 7 years old give the name of Mahomet to a plush bear while any presentation of the clairvoyant of Islam is illicit.
It was punishable by a trouble of whiplashes.
This 54-year-old British teacher in function to Unity High School of Khartoum in Sudan, was stopped on Sunday to her and indicted with attack in Islam and with sedition, by virtue of the article 125 of Sudanese penal code, following several parents' complaints of pupils auprés of the Sudanese Ministry of education.
History goes back up in fact to September, when this teacher asks her pupils, agés of 6/7 years, to choose a name as the plush bear of the class.
« Eight names go out of the mouth of the children, among which Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed », tells the manager of the school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children of 23 have chooses Mohamed as favourite forename.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim clairvoyant, but especially a very common forename in Sudan.
The children then accomplished a book for the class with the photograph of the bear follows the legend " Mon nom est Mohamed ".
The bear it - meme hit no tab with this name, but problem is simply that of the presentation of the clairvoyant considered to be an insult in Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, teacher in the same school in Sudan, added that he knew it well and that it would never have made whatever it is who can be insulting towards a religious creed, « I just regret that she asks the children to vote for a name », it is according to him only about a « innocent error ».
Opinion shared by numerous pupils of the teacher who represent it as « very attentive towards her pupils » and « who never speaks about religion in class ».
Let us say that forename Mohamed is also the second forename most given in Great Britain, he is spelled of English of 14 different manners.
This forename often chooses by the Muslim families a manner is to honour the clairvoyant (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are rules concerning the use of this forename?
Can they give it for instance to a toy?
It is of course about a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienne.
In finale, failure.
The Serbians and Albanian du Kosovo finished on Wednesday morning in Baden, in Austria, a sixth and ultimate session of debates without having been able to overcome their divergences on the future status of the separatist province.
« It is regrettable that parties are not able of reaching an agreement on status », declared the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienne.
Underlining that the peace in the region was « in game », his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
« They do not envisage violence in present but we enter for the very difficult period », he added, noticing that « obvious tensions exist ».
At the end of mediation December 10th
The mediators of the troika, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make themselves last time on Monday in Serbia and to Kosovo.
The future of the province populated in 90 % of albanophones could become more clear when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will delay their report to the Security Council of United Nations, by December 10th.
Debates of Baden, near Vienne, constituted the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troika was loaded with a new mediation by the UNO, last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on December 10th.
The Russians, who have already blocked the conferment of independence in the Security Council in Kosovo, stress them a chase of negotiations beyond this deadline.
« Russia was and remains hired in favour of a negotiated resolution, a resolution of compromise », said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Statement of unilateral independence?
After eight years of onusienne administration of Kosovo, the Westerners think that the independence under supervision of the EU is the only viable resolution.
Pristina claims to be ready to proclaim it in a unilateral way if the Security Council does not cut in its favour.
Belgrade stresses an augmented self-government.
« Unfortunately, no agreement was found », announced the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel of Baden where have taken place since Monday these « final negotiations ».
Hashim Thaci, the ancient commander of the kosovare rebellion and future Prime minister of the province, announced his regrets.
But he added that the plan of self-government introduced by Belgrade « belonged to a past which drove to murders and to deportations ».
« Effect dominoes »
The Serbian president Boris Tadic thought from his part that a compromise was always possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against consequences of an unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Said Belgrade to fear a « effect dominoes notably » in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of 1990s.
« For the Serbia, he said, it does not mean that a compromise is impossible. »
On Tuesday, the Serbian deputation had insisted so that any decision returns exclusively to the Security Council, where her Russian ally has a right of veto.
« The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word »
« Alone a resolution within the Security Council is allowable for the Serbia », had declared the Serbian Prime minister, Vojislav Kostunica.
« These negotiations lasted two years.
They have to end as they began: in the Security Council. »
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had answered that « the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on status », adding that any unilateral statement of independence on behalf of albanophones would be made « in cooperation » with the Westerners.
Bush tears off an agreement between Israeli and Palestinians
The president George Bush announced, at the opening of the conference of international peace united by his care on Tuesday in Annapolis, in Maryland, when the Israeli and the Palestinians had finally come to an agreement on a common declaration.
He added that the Israeli Prime minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to hire negotiations immediately with a view to finding final regulations of the old bone of contention of 60 years between their two people.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would make everything to help them to conclude a "peace treat" before the end of year 2008.
Meantime, the Palestinians have to dismantle terrorist facilities " and Israel must put an end to its activities of colonization, declared Bush, reminding of both parties in their obligations with regard to "movement order" for the peace which they accepted in 2003.
The leader of the White House underlined that negotiations between Israel and Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim " at concluding a peace treat solving all outstanding questions, without exception, including central questions ".
This appellation recuperates the three prickly problems in the middle of bone of contention between Israeli and Palestinians: future borders of the Palestine, status of Jerusalem and fate of the Arab dispelled refugees of their homes in what is the State of Israel during the conflict today of 1948.
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted so that negotiations to come are " total and deepened " and concern all aspects of regulations, naming " Jerusalem, the refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, between others ".
Going up to the turn to the stand, Olmert got involved talks to come to be "direct and uninterrupted" and to make " an effort to fasten them in the course of 2008 ".
Bush fixed at the end of the year 2008 the delay of implementation of his " vision of two States " Palestinian and Israeli which coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had acquired a commitment in the sense from Bush before deciding to participate in conference.
Arabia, from which the participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offers peace in Israel in exchange for its collection of all Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including Eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a crossroad in the history of Middle East, more particularly because he attacks the roots of conflict and his central aspects ", considers the prince Saoud in her interview at the daily arabophone in Saudi capitals.

Spectacular repairing on the space station
The astronaut Scott Parazynski and his friends of crew of the international Space station (SIMPLE PERCENTAGES) will have needed more than seven hours of employment in the space to perform the spectacular repairing of a torn, necessary solar panel in pursuit of the scientific activities of the station.
A risked exit which collected records due to his length, its distance of habitable modules, fastness with which it was imagined, of tools "knocked up " by the astronauts to perform repairing.
Problem appeared on Tuesday while the astronauts had relieved Harmony module of the shuttle Discovery, a big cylindrical room made responsible for receiving soon the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see supervised).
This module is a kind of quay of appontage for modules-laboratories.
But it is necessary to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a module of production of electricity by solar panels weighing 17,5 tonnes, already present on SIMPLE PERCENTAGES, to put it in post office on its final position.
After displaced credit, the crew started the redeployment of the solar panels of module with a 76-metre wingspan.
And it is there that one of the panels, which unfold as accordions, was harmed on near a metre by a cable which got jammed.
Deployment was stopped not to harm the panel more.
The astronauts, who owed to origin to perform an exit of control of the shuttle Discovery, then to go to repair another solar panel the system of rotation of which was faulty, saw themselves forced to dedicate himself to the harmed panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to prance at the end of the 30 metres in lengths of the arm operated by remote control by the shuttle added to that of the station to perform repairing.
It is one of the best "Spacewalker" (walker of the space) of Nasa.
Big, resistant, very artful, he has the very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years old, this doctor of training was therefore made responsible ' for "operating « on the "hurt" solar panel.
Having precisely surveyed damage, it severed the faulty cable and installed kinds of ' "splints" on the harmed zone.
It was helped by a second " spacewalker " remained near the lock and, near inside, by other astronauts among whom Peggy Whitson, the major's wife of the crew.
The tool which it used, a minicane of ice hockey enveloped by insulating material to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred of volts, was conceived and "knocked up " by the astronauts on board of the station.
Once operation was ended, Scott Parazynski has given that the panel is entirely unfolded before doing the stocktaking of its tools and regaining to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts used half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts regain to the Discovery shuttle for return on Earth envisaged on Wednesday.
The title EADS punished in Stock Market
Action EADS is going down in netly nowadays in the Paris bourse, after the group of aeronautics and defence announced that he was going to have to spend billion euro between 1,2 and 1,4 to face up delays of A400M.
EADS loses 4 % in 21.96 euro nowadays in the Paris bourse.
The group was made to see again its prediction of operational result for 2007 further to delays procreated by the slow progress of the development of the motor of A400M, which conditions the inauguration theft of the plane.
The expense to palliate the delay taken in the delivery of sound of military transport plane, announced in October, amounts " between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euro among which more than 1 billion for Airbus ", announced the headquarters of the European constructor EADS.
Owing to these expenses, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of result of working (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of the quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without more ciphered precision.
The group also points out that the estimate of new expenses is consistent with the delay of six months.

The choice of status quo
There will not be suspense, on Sunday, at the exit of ballot boxes: the Russians are going to opt in great numbers for the party of the president Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, or even for authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
In three days of legislative elections, the Russian president Vladimir Putin sends to the voters a message televised on public channels, already recorded today but content of which is kept to be secret.
It makes it as chief candidate of united Russia, the party pro-Kremlin win of which promises to be enormous.
Yesterday, the president let nothing show through by accepting the foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new load against the Occident accused of interference - his topic of predilection during the campaign.
« We know the price of a true democracy and wish most transparent and most opened, honest elections, elections without tears », he added.
With the eyes of opposition, they are far from count.
It reports a campaign tainted with pressures.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there is « never had of such dirty elections, even at the time of Eltsine ».
After the suppression of the demonstrations of last weekend, the ex-World champion of chess Garry Kasparov, condemned in five days of prison for illegal demonstration, rest forbids of visit according to her lawyer.
« The Russians kept the mentality of the homosexual sovieticus »
Behind these general elections without suspense two much more opened questions stand out:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published the date of the first turn of presidential election, March 2nd, 2008 yesterday; the candidates have until December 23rd to make know.
Elected in 2000 and reelected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot crave for a third successive mandate.
And no successor appears.
- What role will play Putin after March?
Prime minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party united Russia which would choose the government and the president?
Anyhow, in general elections as in presidential election, sitting power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
« The Russians kept the mentality of the homosexual sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny », estimates the sociologist Lev Goudkov, manager of the independent centre Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, from the State university of St. Petersburg, goes back up farther: the society took delay in this country Christianized five centuries after Europe; famous Community mind postponed the training of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the nineties, « Putin went back to the model of a paternalistic State, perfectly accepted by the population especially since this new paternalism was not followed by dread, but by certain economic wealth », estimates Maria Lipman, of Foundation Carnegie.
Today the Russians « abandon personal responsibility willingly » whom they had shortly shown after the blasting of USSR.
« What's the point to think? »
Phenomenon touches all social coats, including business world.
And administrative elite intends to preserve status quo: 65 governors (on 85 leaders of Russian regions) aim the local lists of united Russia.
New freedom imported from Occident is often synonymous with chaos, as in the nineties.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of what the Russians will not vote either for the extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: « What's the point to think?
Those who are in power are not too poor, why to change them? »

Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent wage earners treat dozens thousand individual requests.
However, for a party of the scientific community, the access to Bad Arolsen dresses a restricted interest.

The civil Nurse has stopped today at the beginning of morning the actual mayor of the murcienne village of Totana (of the Popular Party) because of her supposed relation with the woof of urban corruption discovered this week.
ADE more, one of the secretaries of the town council and the leader of Police of the municipality were also stopped.
José Martínez Andreo replaced it me of last May Juan Morales, actual deputy of right, and until then town councillor of the town hall, and which according to the sources of the inquiry consulted by the Chain SER, could be the 'leader ' of this woof.
The agents continue searching the local places and those of the advice of Town planning and they do not move aside the possibility of new stopping in next hours.
Besides, the lawyer of Juan Morales, main suspect of the woof of corruption urbane, discovered at the beginning of this semine, was attributed.
As pointed it out yesterday the Chain SER to the lawyer of the deputy ' of the popular party ' Juan Morales, they stopped it by going out of the domicile of Morality with important material in its posséssion relating to woof.
Besides, according to sources of the inquiry, the object of the inquiry is the supposed collection of commissions of Morality to make easier the signature of an urban agreement with a constructive firm of the galice to re-qualify 200 hectares of ground.

Bono agrees to be at the head of the candidacy of the Spanish socialist party for Tolède and to chair the Congress if they earn elections
The former prime minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the president of the Government and the general secretary of the socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish socialist party for Tolède for next general election and be president of the Congress in case the socialists will earn general election.
So the secretary of organization of the Spanish socialist party, José Blanco, and Bono shone even announced it during a press conference after the meeting which took place in the midday in the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the executive branch of government justified the offer made to the former prime minister because " it is important to count on the best " in political life and Bono " is among the best ".
Besides, he underlined that " yes he seems " that the politician of The Sleeve will be the candidate of the socialist group which will chair the Congress if the socialists will earn the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, which this last made public on November 15th of this year the decision not to come in prochainess general election and to leave the political career to dedicate himself to the conflict against climatic change in the university frame.
The former prime minister acknowledged that the president of the Government did not stop insisting so that he comes back in the vanguard policy since he left it two years ago.
Besides, it made pointed out that, even if the citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish socialist party earns elections, its party wanted to announce the one who will chair the Congress, in a " act of transparence ".
If it attains post, Bono hopes to transform the Chamber in " a home of respect and insult or shouting " and to make that ' " she resembles the citizens more and more ".
" Sometimes it seems miserably that the only place of Madrid where they cannot speak easy and calmly is the Congress, the president of the Government in the Senate in certain opportunities has éte interrupted 26 times ".
In the same way, it had words of praise as his actual president, Manuel Marín and " its know-how " and he did not want to make as though he has already occupied his post not to fall, as he pointed it out, in what his adversaries could consider to be a domination ".
A climatic propaganda
Given that movement against climatic change subjects to a persecution without mercy as well the sceptics of its predictions as those that gives preference in other political and social battles, he must show an iron coherence.
It is all the more the case for a leader of movement who is president of the Government as Zapatero and who thinks that this conflict is more important than that of Islamic terrorism and who offers even to sign a « new contract for the planet ».
This approach makes it explain why action, or inaction, from its Government contributed in a decisive way to the fact that Spain is at the head of the European Union in - éxecution of the Kyoto protocols.
Who are the representatives of - éxecution, in which areas it occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
Besides, he must explain apparently to the Spanish which are the measurements which he is going to take to slow down climatic change.
Which firms will be affected, which habits of the citizens will have to be changed, which individual and collective energy savings will be made to us to make, which economic consequences it will cause.
That is, which will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is a question of sacrificing himself and paying.
Measurements against climatic change, real measurements, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and menacing for the count of firms and individuals.
Up to the hundredth of essence suggested by the Spanish socialist party electoralmente so dangerous in Zapatero seemed to him as he hastened to disclaim it.
That is that it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences with impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this so useful mister for the election campaigns who does not speak, who does not report and who does not demand, prettifies meetings and inspires cordiality.
Provided that it limits only itself to be purely virtual contracting parties and who does not aspire to the fact that we moved in bike or we refreshed ourselves with the fan.

My medicated doctor spoke to me of one of his articles on strange researches called: ' Silver produces cerebral activation, especially if the others accept less '.
That is, that the feelings that generates the monthly pay of the workers depend on what earn the colleagues.
Study was accomplished thanks to magnetic tomographiques resonance in the University of Bonn, and results are published in the last number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of study and manager of the group loaded with pictures of neurocognition of the Institute Life*Brain, in Germany: " The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his companion failed ".
The researchers noticed that when both persons guessed that they accepted the same pay, activation was softened, but if one of them accepted the double, activation was bigger.
I do not know if this conclusion requested so much science.

What insurance does it admit me?
The car insurance, which covers the driver facing possible disasters, implicates an important expense which will depend on various factors, such as the age, sex, the seniority of the driver's licence, registry office, the type of vehicle to be assured or the usage which they make, between others.
To have a car it is the principal.
Are there that, escoger el seguro of automóvil adecuado is incluso más difícil that elegir el modelo of vehículo.
And it is because, to choose the appropriate car insurance, is even more difficult than to choose the model of the vehicle.
Insurance takes in the car an agreement between an insurance company and the underwriter is.
This compromise materializes by a contract of insurance, which establishes that the company accepts the value of granted bonus and in exchange she becomes representative for the obligation to pay indemnity in case of disaster.
Bonus is the price of insurance, which settles by taking into account various mailmen, such as the age, sex, the seniority of the driver's licence, registry office, the type of vehicle to be assured or the usageque they make it, between others.
The companies of insurance establish their prices according to statistics, so that the more likelihood to be subjected to an accident is well brought up, the more the quotation to be poured is well brought up.
It is for this reason that the persons of more than 25 years and the women have to pay lower bonuses, since statistics shows that this persones has a weaker rate of disasters of in their caution.
In the same way, using inventories, companies concluded that the married persons have tendency to have fewer accidents than the single drivers.
The usage which they make of the vehicle will have an influence on frequency, and therefore on likelihood to have an accident.
By augmenting frequency likelihood augments.
They are numerous the variables which the underwriters hold in count at the time of establishing the price of bonus.
It is for it, that the driver must definitely study situation to choose the car insurance which fits the best to its contour.
We shall display the most significant variables here at the time of choosing the one or the other type of insurance, so that this one, besides fitting to the characteristics of the underwriter, gives him a reasonable price.
The young persons of less than 25 years have to face up various disadvantages at the time of crossing a contract with an insurance to an approachable price, as can it be weak experience in behaviour and seniority of the driver's licence.
Although ideal to be definitely assured or an insurance at any risk, other more economic options exist.
The most preshowy drivers can opt for an insurance every risk with frankness, so that they acquire the coverages of an insurance at any risk but at a more approachable price.
This common form implicates that the customer pays a party of the sum of the disaster.
" The party of the sum of the disaster which the customer pours will be established according to the value of bonus, which will be more well brought up more sum will be weak ", Luis Noguera specifies, the representative in Spain of First Europa, mediator of online insurance.
Another option is insurance with third enlarged, so that the customer assures protection to face up damage caused in thirds, but by for those caused on his own car.
Besides, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
An advice.
If you are 25-year-old miner try to be careful and to avoid disasters within reason, since it will reverberate on the premium, being able to reduce the price of insurance to future.
A premium is a reduction of the basic rate which has the company.
Contrariwise, a sanction is an increase of the basic rate.
" Premiums and sanctions will depend on the company and on the benefit of this one.
If the company had a good year she will be able to take the liberty of augmenting premiums ", clarifies Noguera.
Beyond 25 years it becomes easier for the drivers at the time of crossing a contract with an insurance, since the rate of disasters is reduced thanks to collected experience.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose an insurance any risk with frankness.
" Normally the young persons cannot use experience in anticipation acquired after an accident ", assures the manager of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of behaviour, once past ' fright of the beginner '.
However, if the customer is married but still does not have children it is preferable that he negotiates an insurance at any risk, of the momento that his financial standing allows it to him.
Marriages with children are considered by the underwriters as being the persons with the weakest rate of disasters, because increases will be weaker.
In that case the best insurance would be an insurance at any risk with frankness (being able to be 300 euro), or an insurance with third enlarged from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured party has an of high level of premium.
" They have a more relaxed behaviour and they have a bigger power of purchase to afford the luxury to take a more important quantity of franknesses ", judge Luis Noguera.
For the retired men an insurance at any risk with frankness is preferable (by being this one of 150 euro), or an asurance with third enlarged when the underwriter has an of high level of premium.
It is necessary to say that the car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver facing possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, it is for it that it is fundamental to study insurance properly which invite us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to earn a point in Milan to arrive at rounds before the quarter finals

So, Milanese will try to poison the party to the Scottish, with good hope of ranking for rounds before the quarter finals for the second time in champions League, having been beaten during the last edition by a purpose of Kaka during continuations (1-0).
By waiting for the win of ' Rossoneri ' triumph would return only to Shakhtar, in case Celtic would lose, to rank for rounds before the quarter finals to be able to continue the Champions League of UEFA.
And it is because Benfica, well that it is last and without possibilities of following European competition, could attain the third place with a win.

The new affair of gas between Russia and the Ukraine throws alarm.
A dispute on the price of gas ferments between the Ukraine and Russia, augmenting so, risks of repercussions on the exports of fuel oil towards Europe.
The most part of the exports of Russian gas towards the European Union (U.E) are escorted by gas pipelines, and every conduit is scrupulously watched.
Kiev announced that if Russia augments the expense of fuel oil, it will augment the taxes of transit in Russia.
Last year, a brawl between two, had caused a reduction of supplies towards the countries of U.E.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow happens after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, society of monopoly of ownership of Russia providing gas, try for nothing, to find an agreement on the expense of the Russian gas provided in the Ukraine for year 2008.
Gazprom declared that he would augment as planned, his prices in the Ukraine seen that he agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50 % more for the provisioning of gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
The analysts declared that it would include for the Ukraine, an increase of 40 % of the expenses of importation coming from Gazprom.
« It is essential for us to use all our arguments during dialogues, saying that we are a country across which pass in transit the most part of gas, » announced the Ukrainian minister of Economy, Anatoly Kinkh in the news agency Reuters.
« The fluctuations of the expenses of gas would be undoubtedly linked to our debates regarding the taxes of transit (towards western Europe) via the Ukraine »
The last big brawl between Moscow and Kiev talked in January, 2006, the break of the supplies of Gazprom intended for the Ukraine.
It drew away the fall of exports towards western Europe, augmenting prices by consequence.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the supplies of the European Union.
Russia has the biggest supplies of gas, even if the most part of them are still under presses.
By consequence, Gazprom supplements the own supplies with the gas coming from Turkmenistan and other nations of ex Soviet Union in Central Asia.

Scottish health authorities declared to use 1161 persons of besides sea, constituted for most doctors and nurses.
But the general auditor underlined that these figures must indeed be seen again in increase, partly because of problems relating to the identification of the members of the personnel endowed with permanent contract, who could choose or not, to stay in our country.
The inquiry showed that the actual procedures of controls of health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are wholly appropriate.
These controls are performed on passport, work permits and skills.

The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
The scientists declared yesterday that Venus was indeed a planet nice to live.
The existent data of the European vessel on orbit showed that the planet is indeed twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what they thought of before.
Venus is the planet most near the Earth.
These two worlds are in practice the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
The scientists think now that it there billions of years, Venus could have had similar conditions in those of the Lands, and could even have been habitable.
But effect grips owed to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion dûe in solar expulsions alloyed with a slower rotation drove Venus towards whole other type of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, devastated by hurricanes and of tempests of flashes of lightning and has a surface of rather hot temperature to melt lead there.
Discoveries of Come express, the sonde of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet during one year, gives a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth owed to the calamitous changes of climate.
The professor of the department of physical appearance of the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of mission of Come express, declared: « we begin understanding the reason for which the climate of Venus so differs from that of the Earth, although planets in them even are in practice similar.
« Our new data allow us to establish a scenario according to which billions of years ago, Venus would have been identical originally to the Earth, can be even with a habitable surface. »

Still opened to everything
Mitt Romney declared not to be at the height as presidential candidate, to answer the questions of a snowman.
Nevertheless, the republican candidates for the presidency finally agreed to participate in the debate of You Tube, during which of numerous ordinary voters having recorded their questions, subject them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28th, none of put down questions was also ridiculous as that exit discusses another You Tube, when a snowman asked the democrats their position in comparison with the global warming.
But this time ci, questions and answers reflected a lot the conditions of the republican party, candidate for the next elections.
They know not on which criteria, the producers of CNN, which sponsored debate, chose the pop videos of You Tube to show candidates to the aspirants.
But half a first hour of debate, the longest landing of the single topic, was focused on immigration.
Subject is one of the subjects forts for the Republicans.
CNN asked certain voters to phone when they would hear agreeable things: State control raised increases in approbation when the candidates expressed themselves in a rude manner.
The most hard exchange and most along the party was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national forehead, and Mr Romney who is at the head of important preliminary elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani tried to throw into relief the fact that he was accommodating regarding underground immigration during his mayor's mandate of New York.
It attacked Mr Romney, accusing the ex governor of Massachusetts, to use underground immigrants to him.
Both combatants became particularly fierce when they asked them if they would be ready to promote "Amnésia" (giving to the aliens a regular status and the possibility of becoming citizen).
Under 18 candidates as Duncan Hunter, Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, congressman of Colorado, succeeded in deepening this subject.
None of them has the possibility of being elected, but both stay in running, can be thanks to the fact that they began fighting immigration before and in a more trenchant manner than the others.
Generally speaking, the candidates, in least concerning immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for the underground immigrants.
This subject, alloyed with anxiety provoked particularly by the affair of the toxic toys fabricated in China, or of other fears towards the external world, favour the Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between the libertarians and the Catholic conservatives.
But debate became particularly embarrassing when other subjects were raised.
Mr Giuliani asked why he had before supported the campaign for the control of weapon.
JOHN MCCAIN and Mr Romney discussed to know if to put some water in the nose should be considered to be a torment.
One of the dealers asked if the candidates believed in his entirety, in the contents of the Bible.
It led Mr Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is its favourite book, even if it is not on to believe in Jonas's history and whale.
Another dealer asked if Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
They did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in pole position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to its longstanding christian conservatism - to declare that the death penalty is painful although essentials.
When they insisted to know if Jesus would have been in favour, he started to laugh and declared that Jesus is too smart to come on elections.
The human breed remains insolitement opened to everything.
The rise of Mr Huckabee in Iowa coincides with the recent wonderful researches of subventions led by the libertarian Ron Paul, and hiss during the debate of Wednesday.
This two there are appeared by nonexistence, thanks to the fact that both protecting of the party do not succeed in coming to an agreement to decide who is the more known and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party in time and in a persuasive manner thanks to a message of success on the American greatness bringing closer so to the leaders.
This time ci, the party is divided and result is far from being clear.
Pain of the Labour MPs
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole into which to sink; even if it resigned, situation would not change.
In view of the tendency of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No sold decorations, nor of bills of politicians' Parisian hotel, no sucked extra conjugal toe.
But and then a revelation certifies that a rich business man would have concealed during four years, under wrong names, his contributions from the actual Labour Party, identical in more than 650,000 £ $(1.3m), which the party would not have declared: New battle of which Gordon Brown would have crossed well it.
Two months ago, the prime minister made reverse in his plan of election, insulting stupidly British intelligence proclaiming that public opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped contrariwise, to give an efficient and compact government.
Contrariwise, such Vince Cable, the bright democratic liberal leader, declared that terrible Mr Brown was transformed of Stalin to Mr Bean.
The redemption of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble at the edge of the champion horse, showed a fault of directives and a mediocre judgement in an emergency.
The inadequate proposals in favour of the change of the code of levies caused an alliance of the industrial groups against the government.
The loss of personal 25 million data on behalf of the authorities of levies, revealed an unconvincing administrative howler.
A trio of generals in retirement threw an uprising among the Lords, protesting against the reductions of military expenditures: they proclaimed that to be Defence Minister is for them, a partial employment job.
In present time, distrust of shady donations on behalf of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the general secretary of the Labour MPs (and his ex leader of alertness) made that they must have resigned.
Anything of it means that Mr Brown heads inevitably for the exit.
However governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not love the politicians, and trust in them, but leave their doubts of quoting in general during that a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot ameliorate things, or even govern for a long time, during that he risks suspension: the public administration does not work any more; the offices of the ministers assess; the press searches poor stories; and the government becomes on defensive and without any more objective.
In a sense, the position of Mr Brown is particularly difficult, because contrary to other leaders policy, he cannot brag to be a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was really his upper first lieutenant.
Problems relating to Northern Rock and to data of levies for instance, are linked to taken decisions of Mr Brown when he was chancellor of British treasure.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such the long inquiry into the funds of the party « of some silver counting for the members of the Upper House », the voters could think of the opposite.
But the difficult situation which incurs Mr Brown is not so tragic as it looks like it.
Bloopers are not so monstrous as the members of the party of the Tories make believe it.
As in Mr Bean, there is no victim and fraud.
And cure, although painful, could be to make concrete tendencies Stalinist of Mr Brown of always, in favour of a lightly violent and dependable government.
The new scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr Abrahams, a very particular figure, who compares his donations with charity, declared that he wished no public recognition of his beneficence.
He can have her opinion, but it does not belong to him to decide.
Laws against the anonymity of subventionneurs wholesale trades of the politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr Watt, who declared to know about programs of Mr Abrahams, without knowing that it was illegal, will owe by consequence to be questioned, of even besides as Jon Mendlesohn, the representative for the collections of subventions who had spoken about suspicious donations in October.
But heretofore Mr Brown is not involved: Nothing lets think that it knows about these steps, even if the most part of the performed payments are made following her arrival to the government in June.
Heretofore the prime minister made the half.
It fast condemned the legislative fault of its party, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the power of decision rests on a knack that it connait definitely, to make appeal to a committee of inquiry into this subject composed of a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In that case, lessons to be learnt are not complicated.
And if one derided at law, it is within the province of it of the police.
On top of that, there are many other things which Mr Brown must make, such as to find a permanent president for the independent committee of the Standards of public life, without leader for six months, and to prepare a good reform on financially of the political parties.
It would make the Labour party, in an instant of weakness, collaborate with the Tories, what could lead it to abandon its particular financial return with confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such Mr Brown.
But it should confront certain partisan facts.
The party of the conservatives has a good advantage for elections now; he is two years old to recover the voters, and the only manner of acquiring a win is to show a blameless integrity and solid competences.
Frauds of cards.
Would the crisis of mortgages pollute the American market of credit cards?
When there is some blood in water, it is normal to see stirred fins, to swirl around.
Now that the market of American real estate crosses a critical stage, the predators aim at the American market of credit cards.
The analysts from Goldman Sachs think that losses linked to credit cards could attain $ 99 billions if the contagion stretches of mortgages in other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are apparently visible.
There are increases in the rates of expenses and insolvency, what measures the not reusable parts of the balance sheet or that are it, more than 30 days afterwards.
HSBC announced last month which he took $ 1.4 billion in his credits to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of the holders of cards.
It is really too much early to panic.
Expenses and insolvencies are still softened.
According to Moody, a fiscal agency, the rate of insolvency of 3,89 % of the troixième quarter is less than of almost a point in comparison with its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explainable by technical mailmen.
A change of laws in 2005 in the United States, concerning the personal bankruptcy caused an abrupt fall of the archives of bankruptcy, which in its turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore of rate of insolvency) could augment even if the conditions of borrowing had to get worse.
Industry announces in addition to the fixed rates of payment, which throw into relief the sum of monthly debt which the consumers have to regulate.
and the trust in the sureté of the capital of credit cards is rather strong in spite of the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney de TowerGroup, a research society, predicted that the volume of program for 2007 will be 25 % superior in last year.
The direct links of infection between the crisis of mortgages and the market of credit cards indeed exist: the consumers could prefer to augment them supporting debts that the equitable property borrowing disappeared.
But the transmitters of cards pay attention more to the flux of kinds rather than to the value of heritage, and therefore the fall of the prices of real estate did not draw away a change out of necessity in the credibility of the borrowers.
They could even bring advantages in the transmitters of titles of credit.
Bonuses to the consumers for the payment of mortgages fall if ownership costs less than the value of the borrowing; by consequence, the debt by credit card would become a preference to re-pay the whole.
The transmitters of cards are able of answering much more fast than the mortgage and with more suppleness on such conditions of crisis, because they can change rates of interest or corrupt the borders of rédit.
It should reduce in theory the risk of having a quick resumption of actions.
« We are not going to wake up one morning and to revalue all borrowing. » Gary Perlin, the manager of Capital One declared.
If a financial disaster of the market of credit cards is unlikely, there are strong risks of having one following fall.
If the lower prices of real estate and shrinkage in the market of credit bring America towards recession, industry will indeed have to face up a ghoulish future.
Will you pay attention to the back fins?
The British bankers plead culprits for case Enron.
The three British bankers who had to go to manifest their roles in comparison with a fraud made by the previous financial director of Enron, Mr Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading culprits on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared themselves innocent of seven accusations for supposed fraud collusoire in 2000, made by Fastow in a secret financial fraud to become rich in the frustration of their employees.
They should come in the court in January.
But during an audience chaired by the American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found guilty to have made a fraud.
Three ex frames of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the group PLC of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous everywhere in Great Britain because of the procedures of extraditions which lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains another outstanding question for this inquiry thrown further to the fall of Enron in 2001.
The accusations which were inflicted on them in 2002, made understand in Fastow that it was the object of the inquiry of the government in the breaking up of Enron.
Accusations against the bankers, nicknamed " three of Natwest " declare to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and the ex right hand, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of a partner of Enron controlled by Fastow, which was the movie director of numerous fraudulent scenarioes, that helped it àtruquer the procedures of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest for the subsidiary as no, but in fact the three British men already know his value.
A society controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the bank of the subsidiary for £ 1 million.
The bankers paid $ 250.000 to Kopper as interest for this society.
According to accuses it, Fastow would have erroneously announced in Enron that the power corporation was to have to pay 20 $ millions to Greenwich NatWest for its actions in the subsidiary.
But truly this 20 $ millions went to the pockets of the British bankers, Fastow and others else.
According to accusations, the bankers would have acquired $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $ 12.3 millions.
In January, 2004, Fastow pleaded culprit for the active role in two conspiracies in breaking up of Enron.
The British trio was stopped three months afterwards.
Fastow endures an imprisonment of six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British men were liberated further to the payment of a deposit of $ 1 million every, what makes them live in the United States during trial.
Enron, before seventh bigger national society, in bankruptcy in December, 2001 after years of accounting trickeries, could more hide its billion debts or even offer its false speculations as lucrative.
Collapse caused thousands of dismissals, more than $ 60 billion losses of value of the market and more than $ 2 billion losses for the plans of retirement.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the ex chair general Jeffrey Skilling being condemned last year, for their involvement in the collapse of the society.
Skilling was condemned in more than 24 years of prison.
Accusations against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other offences were vain because of his decease owed to a heart attack last year.

Authorities have not determined reasons of the decease of Melle Arroyo yet, but they wait confident, the results of tests toxicologiques which, called will take time, but who should allow to solve this mysterious death which saddened the high ranks of the police of Newark.
Melle Arroyo was the helper of the manager of the police, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September, 2006, and its voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, big worker and persistent », MR MCCARTHY declared regarding Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview, on Wednesday. »

« it was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
« It was embarrassing »
Everybody hopes that Federal Reservation will diminish rates linked to the effervescence of the worldwide grant.
Actions are blown up both quoting of Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that Federal Reservation would have tried to tranquilize the conditions of credit, reducing the rates of interests later promoted by comforting statements of vice govern of the American central bank.
Stock markets blow up in London, New York and everywhere in Europe after Donald Kohn, n ° 2 after Ben Bernanke, president of Federal Reservation, declares that those who decide, must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the agitated financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure the bad-tempered markets seen these new tensions linked to credit, Mr Kohn declared that the recent turbulence « partly reversed certain improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
In case this hard turbulence had to persist, it would augment likelihood of subsequent one inflexibility of financial conditions for the owners and firms, a-t-it was declared.
These comments appear to the investors as an obvious sign that Federal Reservation is ready to inject new capitals into the American markets, and that of subsequent reductions of the rates of interests could stabilize credit terms.
These comments also allowed to tranquilize Wall Street with even more poor news on American economy, such as biggest fall of property sales for October.
Reverberate them of this financial disorder was accentuated further to the statement of Bear Stearns, bank of investment, announcing that it will lay off 650 persons, that is to say, 4 % of its personnel, to reduce expenses to compensate for heavy dûes losses in losing bets of the property borrowing.
20 posts only are envisaged in London where the bank uses 1500 persons.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones augmented by 331 points, that is 2,55 % concluding in 13.289,40 while the biggest indication, S*P 500, took 2,65 %.
In London, indication FTSE 100 took 165,5 points 2,7 % concluding in 6306,2 adding more than 39£ in the value of the British societies are.
German indication Dax augmented by 2,6 % and French CAC40 took 2,3 %.
Before, the reappearance of difficulties of credit in markets was thrown into relief further to the strong request of an auction of fund sorting existent monthly magazines by the Central Bank European, which cut these loans in the European commercial banks in the heavy most well brought up, 4,7 % rate since April, 2001.
Pressures on the Bank of England to follow EDF and ECB and inject of subsequent fund into financial markets of London causing tensions of credit, made that the rates of borrowing sorting monthly magazines " Libor " the British banks, caused their highest growth since last September, in 6,59 % suite a strong rise since November 12th.
England faces up a call to judgement in comparison with the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemma, the one so difficult as other one.
Who will be the percussionist n°6 for England in Kandy this week end, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a so broad context as the first Test against Sri Lanka, which will make decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the selectors who was unusually there to help Peter Moores, leader coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the Président de l' Angleterre, begins filling the forms of candidacy to become a national selector, at least part time.
The one who will not succeed in carrying off the number n°6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sports are it also.
It is never easy to ruin what allows to a man to arrive at the beep of its occupation while other one will never arrive besides lower level, sometimes through lack of chance more than through lack of skill.
There is only in cricket that selection is difficult, because at the end, judgement remains subjective.
Is the good instant to make appear Bopara?
Is it fair in comparison with Shah?
The same thing could be offered in another context, whom to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee " tubby «?; both, new frames having acquired good certificates, professionals, should be promoted: but there is place only as an only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the fair level of a cricketeur unless they grant him at least a chance?
Figures have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketeur must capture the eye of the captain, all at once he must take the door and a percussionist must be lucky to touch the cricketeur of day.
But to capture the eyes of selectors is more complicated.
Many people better made last season, for instance, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself in full form and continued of entrainer to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-rate doors on 33 towers to earn a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both have already lived their instant of glory at the biggest level and hope to give still.
If this will be Shah or Bopara who will play the stadium Asgiriya, it is only a question of opinion.
This choice could ruin or construct the career of a man, but it tells not enough difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and succeeded well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful towers, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled for appearing, which succeeded in becoming the primordial cricketeur of the Test, and it, in spite of the fact that his double hundred marked against Australia in Australia can be still under estimated.
Likelihood envisages that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, further to another debate after today's session at the stadium Asgiriya, will follow their conservative instincts and will favour the biggest experience of Shah against the exuberance of the young person Bopara.
Two have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his bright and considerable beginning in the innings of the Test of 88 in Bombay, first-rate 32 hundred against six for Bopara, which in 22 years is seven years old younger, and his very good classification in launching.
But Shah made only ten towers during his innings two in May against Caribbean during the Test to Lord, his city of player of the Middlesex, and only, immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan again in form, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his so obvious impulses in Bombay.
Contrary to him, the player of Essex is full of exuberance.
Nothing frightens him on a ground of cricket and it went too far when he was newly capsized on one 4x4 during one presentation of Volkswagen, patron of England.
It put back only light wounds, was shocked, even if the first thing that he made was to take its Vodafone (patron definitely on) and to call Alastair Cook, his team member who looked at it from a distance, to ask him s ' " he had seen this? »
Bopara is the best percussionist from a distance, her runny paces allow him to make services which go to him, and that he beats with trust and professionnalité.
To choose the fair man is a thing, to choose the good instant other one is.
Can it be is the true art of selection?
I would be advantageous to give his chance in Bopara, what does not mean that Shah should not be applied if, such the leaves of tea suggest it, it will be it who will play this week end.
Buses bring back people to the job, and to be fought against al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with iraquiens refugees coming from Syria arrived at Bagdad yesterday, pouring out these exiles without silver or without renewals of visa, or others else who hope that the city finds normality.
Some people came back to fight against the activists who moved them away from their home.
In the station of bus Mansour, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 persons transported in escorts of dozens of bus of the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees of Syria and Jordan who came back by their means.
« I decided to go in Syria after they kill several doctors in Baghdas » Sabah al-Qubaisi, a doctor Sunni declared.
« I have come back today because I saw on the television and read in newspapers what took place in Baghdâd and seen that the city is more sure now. »
« They say that the Mahdi army makes no more crimes! » he declared, referring to the militia Shia of the ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who imposed on his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old teacher Shia of the zone of Amariyah dominated by Sunni, came back with his two children, because he could not renew his Syrian visa any more and because regime prevents the iraquiens from working.
His neighbours of Shia in Amariyah called it to inform him that the militia helped by the United States, allowed to dispel Western Al Qaeda of the capital, and invites him to come back.
One of the new comers of Jordan is the leader of a tribe Sunni et Shia which must have left its home north of Baghdâd because of an attack in the grenade after it encourages the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to come back to fight.
« two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me have set up a militia anti Al-Qaeda in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys. »
« That's why I come back today » Sabaah Alu Obeidi, of 62 years declared.
Many people tell have attracted by the growing lull of the capital since the American troops arrived, and at the sight of adult continuing education from « groups of implicated citizens » armed well and collaborating with the American servicemen to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others tell have been made to come back because of the problem of visa and the decline of the capital of Damascus, where more d ' 1,3 millions of iraquiens have run away last years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years, father of three children, expressed the distrust felt by all regarding visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister Shia, which would have asked the Syrian government to restrict to force people to come back to the country.
More than two and a half million persons would have run away from the country because of the sectarian companies of death.
« we did not have problem until al-Maliki comes in Syria and encourages the government not to give visas anymore to iraquiens, to force them to come back in Iraq « the retired man Sunni declared.
« I cannot trust in a government which supports the criminals who burned my home when I left ».
The fall of violence can be partly explained due to the fact that Sunnis was dispelled of the zones of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lesser.
They fear that refugees' sudden flux augments again sectarian tensions and bring back battles.
Small Saar, good training.
The smallest federated State leads in professionelle training, and shines even all over the international orientation of its the upper schools.
It is only in a domain which a deficit weighs on sarrois, similar in that besides of the country.
" I have exliqué yesterday for the 50th time in one not - sarrois, that we are not French " - it is the slogan which the smallest federated state, by autoderision, shows for its 50th birthday.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a big role in the system of training of Saar, system which is put the fifth in the monitor of the trainings of the Institute of German economy of Cologne.
So, already by tradition, the upper schools collaborate closely with the neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
Until this day, the students have the possibility of ending their studies by a double, or even a triple certificate there.
The well brought up quotitée of 15,6 for one hundred foreign students testifies it.
Saar drives moreover also the favorite sons up to the upper schools in the upper number to average - many of them without a certificate of Gymnasium.
" In Saar, they use the system of professional training ", says Axel Plünnecke, expert in training to IW.
More than a young person on five acquires his title of studies in a training college, so Saar is in more than seven points above national average.
Also the possibilities of combination of a professional and academical training are comparatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the panel of double programme is second the best of Germany.
In spite of a practical training and a growing request, the number of diplomés in engineering however went down by a third in last years.
That's why the Ministry of education sarrois obliged the upper schools in a campaign of marketing in the subjects of sciences of the engineer.
" After the first studies PISA, we celebrated a big number of reforms in the general schools. ", says a spokeswoman of the Ministry of the education.
So the government introduced into all federated state of the tests of comparison.
So that the children begin earlier learning, last year of crêche is exempt from right - a model which entretemps of other federated states also copy.
Only ones of future studies of comparison will be able to show if the performances of the pupils improve in a lasting manner.
In studies PISA in 2003, pupils' share at risk was reduced from 29 to 20 for one hundred.
In total however, Saar did not improve as much as other federated states.
The Bavarian take out better there.
And in the big frustration of sarrois, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by studies PISA - they could otherwise earn points in this domain.
Because the language of the neighbour is obligatory in secondary schools - even if sarrois is not French.
Chávez regulates watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon make tick-tock otherwise than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, the president Hugo Chavez will make take back up the chronometer of half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez becomes entretemps a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela announced it, due to a new law, watches will be regulated at less four hours and a half of universal time.
In that way, the South American country acquires a spindle per hour which exists in no other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position between others due to the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in the full hours.
Besides, Chávez announced the suspension of relations on Wednesday a (local time) with the neighbouring country, Colombia, due to hostages' affair.
The nationalist of left announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe would remain president of Colombia, he would maintain relations neither with the state leader, nor with the Colombian government.
" I cannot it, already only because of my respectability ", said Chávez which hastens a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by means of referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would reinforce its power emotionally in the country.
The element shutter release of this dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw the mandate of negotiations in Chávez regarding hostages' release with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe " would have spat with the face " of the Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain also Chávez is on everyone's lips.
A new ring of mobile phone makes rage in the country: " Por qué no callas you " (why you are not silent) sentence is that already more than a half million persons downloaded on Internet.
It was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos who, in the most recent ibéro-American summit, was irritated by the constant questioning of the populists of left and who told him to be silent.
A fall of wages threatens Germany in 2007.
In spite of the strong situation, to a forecast, a true decrease in value of the wage threatens the German wage earners this year.
Experts named different reasons to explain their pessimist forecast.
To a counting of foundation Hans-Böckler, the wage earners should expect a real reduction in 2007 on their chip of pay in comparison with the previous year.
" Error returns to the weak development of wages, to the increase of the Tax on the added value and to the rises of the prices of the food products and energy ", said Gustav Horn de l' Institut for macroeconomics and research on the situation, in the newspaper " Bild ".
New expenses could also intervene in unemployment insurance for the wage earner.
The Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said in the newspaper " Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " that the fall envisaged by the unemployment insurance of 3,3 for one hundred for the New Year was certainly correct and reasonable in actual situation.
However the national Agency for job does not any more have the right to be in embarrassment to ask the Confederation of credits or financial helps, according to the words of the politician of SPD.
They knew on Tuesday that the explosion of the prices of the food products and hydrocarbons had pushed the rate of inflation to sound more of high level for 13 years.
In total, prices augmented 3,0 for one hundred from one year to the next.
Venus is the hellish binoculars of the Earth.
In spite of its atmosphere hostile to life, Venus resembles the Earth more than that they believed up to now: the European space sonde " Come express " discovered flashes of lightning in the atmosphere and whirls of wind in poles, the similar to those who appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, the scientists assume that there are flashes of lightning on Venus.
The European sonde " Come express " has brought proof of it - today it discerned electromagnetic waves on the verge of the atmosphere: flashes of lightning on Venus burst at a height about 56 kilometres of cloud in cloud, brings back Christopher de l' Université of California in Los angeles in the "Natural" scientific magazine.
According to the famous theory of the cyprine, flashes of lightning would have shown life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans which drove to the training of amino acids, stone of angle of life.
It is not case on Venus: " If life there was, it must have been in the very ancient date of History ", explains Sean Solomon of "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be hardly living things in the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is hundred times denser than on Earth, it sometimes reigns there of 500 degree temperatures.
" Venus is perhaps the hellish binoculars of the Earth, but she remains binoculars ", said Russel.
Why Venus, which resembles the Earth so much as a whole and dimensions, was hit of such a different evolution, the fundamental question of mission ASE is.
Departure of " Come express " in November, 2005 was an important stage in research vénusienne, since no more sonde was en route to the exploration of this planet for years ninety.
In the opinion of researchers, the most recent research results which were now introduced in several articles of "Nature" underline the singularity of Venus not only within solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbouring planéte are more numerous than assumed at first glance.
So the researchers found a whirl of clouds, besides the whirls of wind déja known in the North Pole, in the South Pole, which turns even more quickly.
Phenomenon reminds of air currents in hemispheres of the Earth in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni de l' Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Italian Fisica Cosmica.
The planéte second of the solar sytème has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 kilométres, almost so big.
The planéte described to be star of evening or the morning turns around the sun in hardly 225 days.
It turns however more slowly on itself: a vénusien day lasts 243 landowning days.
Although Venus, with temperatures in surface of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, reminds hardly of the Earth, the scientists assume that planétes two were formed in similar conditions.
On two, water piled up and stayed on the Earth in form of oceans, but got lost in the space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide settled on Earth in form of carbonate, it constitutes on Venus the biggest party of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends the meeting of Merkel with the Dalaï Lama.
The Président de la République fédérale d' Allemagne Köhler demands the end of the quarrel of parties regarding the reception of the Dalaï Lama in the Ministry of Justice.
In a indirect way, it criticized SPD owing to attacks against the chancellor's wife after meeting in September.
The federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and commands the big alliance to round off quarrel regarding the reception of the Dalaï Lama.
" We should not introduce in the outside world a nation divided on this question ", said Köhler in Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalaï Lama by the chancellor's wife Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
" Human rights have an universal validity, even if I have respect as difference between cultures " Köhler said.
Each knows that Germany should keep sensitive scales in foreign policy, underlined the Président de la République Federal, but defended Merkel against reproaches according to which it would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor's wife did not take her distance with the traditionelle policy of single China.
" China also knows it ", said Köhler.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had introduced his discontent indirectly regarding the reception of the Dalaï Lama and had been attacked for it except the ranks of CDU.
Steinmeier had notably complained about the " policy of face " of CDU in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalaï Lama in the Ministry of Justice, virulent annoyance was felt in the germano-Chinese reports.
So the Chinese government not only called off the Minister of Finance German Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information of Spiegel, also froze the dialogue said about strategy of ministers of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
The head of government of China Wen Jiabao demands Angela Merkel of reconnaitre of the allemmande chancellor's wife consequently that the reception of the Dalai Lama was an error.
China refuses that the European politicians accept the spiritual leader of the Tibet in his official functions, supports Wen Jiabao so Chinese position.
Words and acts of the Dalaï Lama would show that he tries to separate from China the Tibet and other Tibetan regiones, what also includes other actual provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots as those of France.
Street fighting with the police, shooting, cars in fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots as those of France.
Everything must be implemented so that the social discontent in Germany does not burst on streets by violence, demanded German Interior minister.
Barricades which burn, of scrap merchants who pull on the police with shotguns: after serious riots of young persons in France, German Interior minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We must see to it that a social explosive contitue not also to us and deactivates in violence.
We must take this seriously ", he said in "Neue Presse" appeared in Hanover.
All young individuals would not succeed in taking out with the quick transformations of social reality there.
The Confederation, the federated States and villages worked already firmly to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
It would touch the incorporation of the immigrants not only.
" Summits of incorporation at conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes. "
But it would be however too much early for the end of alert.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that in the German suburbs, there are not sociological problems nor from the point of view of town planning as in France.
In the Parisian agglomerations of the north, young persons had devoted themselves to serious street battles with the police during last nights.
In Toulouse also, cars and public buildings burned.
Bigger efforts of incorporation on behalf of the German government, here is what demanded the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Considering riots in France, Kolat warned against the " effects of simulation ".
The situation in Germany would not certainly be as explosive as in France.
But there would remain however a necessity to act.
Kolat puts the emphasis on the fact that the quota of unemployed persons at the young persons underneath 25 existent years of immigration would be superior to average.
It would be necessary to assure training first of all more places.
Kolat insisted: " We must give a perspective to the young persons ".
The President of the Turkish communities added however that a social control in families more took place in Germany than in France.
Many existent young persons of immigration besides do not want to destroy what their parents constructed here.
Kolat motivated: " But we must really be careful. "
It would be necessary " quickly to give to the young persons the possibility to participate in job and in training ".
In the meantime in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during night.
Units of police were in position, a helicopter flew over the zone with searchlights.
Authorities in post office announced three arrests as well as some cars and burned garbage cans.
Since conference, a deployment about 1000 force of security assures peace.
The police will intervene as long as essentials, annoncait Interior minister Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit of the suburb.
At night of Tuesday, about 80 policemen were hurt during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
At night following, disturbances overflowed in Toulouse.
Riots burst after an accident of circulation in which two young persons had died on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutions, the police is not representatives for the death of the young persons.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The entrance in utopian stage of the chancellor's wife shows that the alliance finished it with the bottom - and that there is nothing more to wait from her.
In what country saw this chancellor's wife exactly?
After its distressing intervention in general debates of the German Parliament, which was disordered and poor of contents, it is necessary to say: not here - not in the country which should, in finale, be governed by her.
Reproach to concentrate too much on policy was pushed back by Angela Merkel of a hard and haughty sentence.
It is provincial, she said and only showed thereabouts that she does not want to understand what want criticisms.
In the Parliament, it made visible of all to what extent this reproach was precise.
There was neither concrete interest nor almost feelings as the problems of the country to be felt.
On the place, Angela came as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, which runs away in foreign policy and that even there stays in vague approximation.
For instance the protection of climate: in the field, she is still very pleased and still on agreements of Heiligendam, but does not say how targets on climate will have to be reached in our country.
Even, praise on his/her own - to have also not enough modesty, leader of the CDU would still have refused it two years ago.
Now it holds on tightly to very made expressions, that growth would touch people.
Thereabouts it destroys its picture of pragmatiste, which résoud problems instead of prettifying the world.
But in the empire of the cloud Angela, the problems of domestic policy are a marginal phénomème.
Poverty at the children and the concerns of the workers down with wage?
He has some secondary sentences for it.
In the field the number of times reveals when she makes slips when it is about family allocation.
Here, Merkel needs three kickoffs to pronounce a half definite sentence.
It reels on unknown ground, as soon as this becomes concrete.

Romney also makes make lesson vigorously by the veterans of the Vietnam, when he refuses to condemn as a torment what they call "Waterboarding", a method of cross-examination where they simulate drowning.
Nevertheless the fact that the important topics of the campaign go entretemps beyond war in Iraq and debates on torment sees itself in the reactions of the common room of St Petersburg in Florida.
That the conservative stocks are rented or that the future increases in levies are refused, clapping erupts in the auditorium.
It is there that show themselves once again where domicile weaknesses of both favourites.
" I made an error in this epoch ", explains repentant Romney and offers his apologies to the foundation and to the public televised to have in 1994 still been a supporter of the abortion.
Giuliani contrariwise passes in a noose when they ask him for her opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.

It besides does not seem to upset too much the misters themselves.
The fact that it puts together Harmonia plays once again assures some stir among the amateurs of Krautrock.
They have the right to reveal it here: directed opinion polls reveal that, certainly, the name considers in the collective memory of pop, but under any circumstances in so lasting a manner so that this group misses so grievously for 32 years.
But why would not German also have the right to celebrate its living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is called trompeusement "Krautrock" always more liked in England and in America than in the country of origin.
Lorque the industry of music awarded price in 2003 Echo to the survivors of the group of Cologne Can for their work, they saw faces in the room pop German interviewers.
When Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked groups Düsseldorf and Neu! in praise panegyric, astonishment did not have borders anymore.
Later, during concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the stage of Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the the unknown is the only and unique.
Memory is of this fact déja taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and because during this period, the power of impact which suffered was weaker than what was later allocated to him by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
They played in cellars underneath the Berlin stage first.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a quality-label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had fixed in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name as guitarist with Neu! which was in epoch perhaps the most radical German group.
By 1973, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster nevertheless in banishment in the fôrets of Weserbergland.
There, in the ancient farm of Weser, a decline of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities escaping the city.
Less ideological than in the community " Kommune I ", where Roedelius had the right to make torment as nurse.
Rather an artistic existence like Spitzweg.
So-called was in the garbage can a pennant of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many kept Harmonia far from it.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the luxury following " ".
Because as serene and modest as sounded music, the group suffered from material misery.
The crop of the firewood was not of use for himself in search of one.
The CD " LIVE 1974 " which has just appeared was recorded during a concert in Griessem in front of a public record of about 50 heads, as well as somebody believes remember.
Rother issued in this epoch wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius an indecent requirement.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother atterit in the spheres of esotericism and assured its existence with albums as "Flammende Herzen" (blazing hearts).
Cluster revived in the eighties and has since more successes than Harmonia has never had it.
They owe the album Live de Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His quality-label Grönland settled purpose to maintain Krautrock as inherent German contribution in contemporary music.
Neu! déja dug out in this opportunity as work personnel of Roedelius had.
Harmonia's physical resurrection takes place at the Home of the cultures of the world in Berlin.
Subsidized publicly, as part of the Festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is, British, ancient punk there and author of the paperback " Krautrock Sampler ".
There is also the creator of the Loveparade, Dr. Clod.
By which the whole margin of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be surrounded regarding music future pop.
The left empty place by the group will be filled up by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno glides in the room in the middle of peculiar sounds: " Alone true music, you listen to the future ".
There are photographs which show the producers with Harmonia in the room of the farm.
The projections of other photographs in black and white of tools wired in pigsty are of use for the training of the legend.
In front of, the three veterans are once again occupied to extemporize.
But more by gluing together microphones on the organ and on the battery, to pull in the instruments of prodigious sounds thanks to instruments with constructed effects oneself.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
Three in big fignoleurs of technology.
In it even the choir of the home will change nothing there.
Conducted by Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and they sing "Aaaaaaaah" at pretty instant with grandiloquence.
Krautrock was always a very English concept.
It never belongs act of rock.
Roots were less searched in the blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68 " is not completely wrong, and Harmonia also is not allowed to irritate now any more by it consequently.
But what goes most from one will be thoroughly covered on the stage.
Where begins music and where does it finish?
It can get on the nerves of somebody (?) or grant of fleeting instants of big joy.
Richard Gere is not simply rather cynical.
With "The Hunting Party" and " bloody Peace ", two films approach the war of Balkans once again.
But two do not persuade.
Or plans rest of surplus on action and on exchanges of senseless shooting or contrariwise they are too lachrymose.
Here, same Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" cannot help.
Good news first: certainly the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic always hide in the mountains of Balkans, but it is precisely there, in the gloomiest hinterland of the war of Bosnia, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had lastly lost of view the nicest man of the years eighty, because far too many roles far too many press conferences gentillets and futils in films with feelings for women and on the topic of Buddhism robbed of him the desire to show itself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look really at "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the dispelling (why the today's films must be also long and confused as of drivers' collective labour agreements of engines?)
It delivers a splendid presentation full of twinkles: at the bottom, his figure of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere would have been able to become, if destiny and industry of films were not also benevolent: a man with his best instants for a long time behind him, but who, even as monument ruins it in his decline, however kept visible rests of his ancient charm.
But in spite of this trump, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production " bloody Peace ", which also goes out this week, the interminable suite of films missed on the war of Balkans.
Of " bloody Peace " they can make trial fast: the film speaks about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save one Serbian of the kosovars snipers, in whom one of two falls still promptly loving.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbians are for time introduced as the only reasons of all wrong, this as flat film as a TV film gets lost very too quickly in action and exchanges of senseless shooting.
It remains a kind of " Alarm for Cobra 11 " without freeway but with a war on the place.
Contrariwise, they can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why at the bottom there has never been a true good film on the war of Balkans.
The history of the three American war reporters, who condition to trace the high war criminal " the fox ", would have perhaps been able to become, with another film director and another scriptwriter (both at the same time Richard Shepard), at another instant a new " Apocalypse Now ".
Because stories are alike in a remarkable way: two males go in small team in the forest, to fulfil something that the servicemen cannot make and for both males, it becomes a trip in madness.
One of the reasons of the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that they simply do not let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic endowed with a heart, as it is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, script must allocate him moreover a romantic adventure with Bosnian one slaughtering later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely poor, when the reporter, in the space of last five minutes, by a speeded up technique, reaches that NATO, CIA and all hunters of bonuses of the world did not succeed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for a fair revenge in Bosnian Muslim.
It is so poor that they should grab the International Court of the Hague of crime against film logic.
In that case, the film has a too deep human preoccupation.
He wants to report that Karadzic and Mladic are still in freedom, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they unusually have to agree) of not driving hunt in a rather intensive manner owing to secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and the villain are this time so similar that a famous poême of Brecht comes to us to idea.
That speaks of a wooden mask of an Asiatic demon on the working table of the poête: " Commiserating, I see the filled veins of the forehead, apparently: as it is getting tired to be malicious. "
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescentes heads, but which insinuate to what extent he is getting tired to be good.
Problem is not restricted to the type of films on the war of Balkans.
Newly, it was brought back in this newspaper which all Hollywood films on Iraq supported with big flops.
They can add: there has still never been films a good on the Southern Africa.
What is worth every time: when a star trails along on a home of crisis or on a minefield, he goes out of it then about "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, " Jenseits to go Grenzen " with Angelina Jolie or " "Blutdiamanten" with LEONARDO DICAPRIO.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyhow, decades are always crossed before Hollywood can shoot a good film on holocaust with " The list of Schindler ".
Certain films definitely have to mature again - those who are worth classical writings on the Vietnam "The Deer Hunter" today, "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were celebrated under no circumstances unanimously in their epoch as leaders of work.
But perhaps in soaps we today so simply too much on conflicts of the world, where every massacre arrives direct on two screens all at once at the home,
And it robbed of the scriptwriters the lack of scruples which they need to tell nice stories.
" To be or not to be " or " The dictator " became in fact so good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin still did not know to what extent nazi regime really prevailed.
Perhaps that you should not want to be good when they want to make flims good.
Perhaps it is necessary to have sarcastic artistic look and outdistanced by the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When they questioned it on the parallel between his historical novel " Dictionary of Lemprière " and the war of Balkans, he answered: " This is fond only of the fact that certain things never change ".
" The big cities will always be dreadfully dangerous, the men will always be slaughtered of a terrifying facon and war règnera always in Yugoslavia. "
Von Beust harvests criticism for the cancellation of Olympics.
The catch of detachment of the mayor from the candidacy of Hamburg for Summer Olympic Games collided in policy and economy with virulent criticisms.
Many people want to continue fighting for Games by the waterside.
But Von Beust calls to realism in the evaluation of chances.
The main manager of the Chamber of commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, represented an abandonment on Wednesday as being " poor for local economy ".
Recently, no other plan had unfolded so much force of motivation in the city as the idea of Olympics.
" Without this objective, the politico sports impulse would not have been able to be supported in the same measurements ".
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury plan, but to find him a new starting point in more long-term, " who takes as starting point another changed agenda ".
The mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambition of Hamburg was unrealistic at least until year 2028.
" It is not Hamburg which decides on a candidacy in Olympics, but the German Confederation of Olympic sports " Von Beust in ONLINE WELT said.
It renvoit in the decision discounted by the Confederation of sports at the beginning of December, regarding the candidacy of Munich for the winter games of 2018.
This priority means for us, that, in the period of time which we had envisaged until 2028 to there, we shall have no chance. "
However the dream does not belong definitely to the past, said Von Beust.
The sports Confederation of Hamburg (HSB) regretted statements of Beust.
Of it impression would be given that Hamburg does not want to apply its candidacy any more for Olympic Games in next 25 years.
" It is too much early to close up an opportunity, by burying plans already now ", said on Wednesday the president du HSB Günter Plo ß.
An abandonment of the candidacy would be more in contradiction with statements of the leader of the Senate on the occasion of reception in pleinière assembly of the German Confederation of the upper schools of sports.
There, Von Beust would have qualified the candidacy of Hamburg in Universiades of 2015 as " not being a substitute " in Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Confederation of the upper schools of sports had first in last weeks nominated Hamburg as city candidate.
The fraction SPD of the mayor reproached the Senate for not having used this precious time in the building of accommodation in Hamburg.
" The development of Small Grasbrook was refused by the Senate during years because it played the card of Olympics and excluded the building of accommodation ", said the delegates of the SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While SPD always claimed for Small Grasbrook a plan inserted into Olympics and a later use of accommodation, CDU would have exclusively bet on " factor Blowhole ".
The candidacy for Summer Olympic Games in 2012 would have raised a big enthusiasm from his part in Hamburg.
Hamburg had nevertheless broken against Leipzig.
These are not the cases of Warhols.
The one who links up concepts Sweden and wooden case, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or yes?
At present, wooden cases fabricated in Sweden throw shades on the list of the writings of Warhol.
A big party of ninety Brillo-Boxs of " Portrays Stockholm " listed there counterfeiting is.
After the Swedish newspaper " Expressen " calls into question some months ago the genuineness of Brillo-Boxs of year 1968 of Andy Warhol, internal researches of Moderna Museet of Stockholm lead to a result today to désenchanteur: six "Brillo-Boxes", present of which the ancient manager of the museum Pontus Hulten gave in 1995 Moderna Museet, are of copies - as well as a big party of other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of " Portray Stockholm ", who circulate on the international market of art.
The ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting continuity of artistic productions and curatoriques.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first ones " Brillo-Boxes ", of painted wooden cases, which are based on the rouge-bleu-blanc design of the cardboards of soap in powder " Brillo ".
An exhibition of its job in Moderna Museet introduced in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - hundreds of cases Brillo made by cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been directly delivered of the plant of cardboard Brillo.
It was not about works of art, but rather about their models, about samples of exhibition here.
At the same time, Warhol had given the approval in 1968 to make produce some wooden cases Brillo in Sweden, which were not besides displayed in Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of epoch speak today about fifteen wooden cases which in epoch would have entered of right the history of art and auction, as Brillo-Boxes original of Andy Wahrol allowed, with the appelation " Portray Stockholm ".
Some of them attained in auctions more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem consequently is that fabled guiding of the museum Pontus Hultén aspired, wrongly, later that about hundred wooden cases had been produced and displayed in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have given up to him.
Truly, the 105 cases of Hultén were produced in Malm ö in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol was already dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservative of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three others of the private suedoises collections, among which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and sanded, then they applied with a brush of the white oil painting.
The texture of the copies which date from year 1990 reveals contrariwise that painting was directly applied without thorough coat to the stratified panels, with the aid of a roll of painting - furthermore it is not about an oil painting, but about an acrylic.
" These cases were not allowed by the artist and should be taken away by the official list of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol ", gives to understand the manager of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: " If 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come another decision there, Moderna Museet will classify the six cases in its collection as copies / equipment of exhibition. "
Already in July Authentication Board announced of course, that it would investigate " heavy accusations " which will be raised in the affair of the cases of soap in powder.
But since they take on an aura of an inéxorable silence there.
The rebel Soldiers of Manila leave
In Philippines, the rebel soldiers leave, the same who had taken up position in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the collection of the chairwoman Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The leader Antonio Trillanes, who reproached the Chairwoman for corruption and for the electoral fraud, said to reporters in the hotel that he would know how to answer for no bloodshed.
The soldiers faithful to power had taken attack not long before the hotel with the aid of gas lacrimogène.
Both dozens of soldiers had taken up position for the hours in the building.
About the half of them was held on Wednesday in front of courts owing to a try of putsch missed in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
It used audience to make off suddenly with about 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen, who normally had to watch them, has obviously deserted in his favour and had joined its mutiny.
They introduirent in the hotel Peninsula and demanded the collection of the chairwoman Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in power fastened the area around the respectable hotel.
The Chairwoman called an urgent session of the Office of security.
The national Adviser for security Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
" People have it enough ", said Trillanes.
" We call the persons to meet ".
The general Danilo Lim, who commanded before the unit of elites of the scouts Rangers, declared that other units of the army quickly wanted to join the step.
The criticisms of regime had called to a big demonstration against the Chairwoman on Wednesday.
His government is encircled for months by the reproaches of corruption.
The quarter of finances of Manila has been already since 2003 the theatre of the try of mutiny about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
Insurrection broke about 24 hours afterwards in the refusal of the army to join it.
Since 1986 there have already been seven tries of putsch at least against governments elected democratically in Philippines.
Internet United becomes a main stockholder of Versatel.
Internet United made sure a participation of more than 20 for one hundred societies of telecommunications Versatel.
The medium price by action is 14,46 euro, as announced it the society on Wednesday.
Only 20,05 for one hundred issued capitals would be detained.
They had déja speculated before about a redemption.
Option would remain opened to augment participation still in Versatel.
With this not they try to speed up the strengthening of the German market of DSL, announced United Internet.
Just before, assumptions had been made already on Wednesday regarding an entrance, after the Berenberg bank augments its participation to the operator of network of Düsseldorf of 5 for hundred - 15,1 for one hundred.
The institute of credit would detain silver only for a third party, as it is told on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a participation of about 10 for one hundred in the society of mobile telephony Drillisch.
As part of an increase in capital, Drillisch put in Stock Market 17,4 millions new actions worth 106,4 million euro.
Internet United bought 5,15 millions for 31,1 million euro.
Besides, societies opened negotiations about collaboration in marketing of the products of DSL and mobile telephony.
" We renforcons our partnership ", explained a spokesman of Internet United.
Both societies founded the society in participation MSP to absorb the rival Freenet.
For the time being, both societies want to feel themselves satisfied with their participation of ten for one hundred to Freenet, and not to use their right to endorse 18,49 for one one hundred additional to Freenet, entrusted United Internet on Thursday.
Both societies would leave themselves however all opened options, particularly to augment participation in ITS Freenet, as it was learnt.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet regarding a strategical partnership had come to an end in mid-October.
The still hardly foreseeable poker on Freenet which lasts for months is part of the strengthening of the German market of telecommunications.
Freenet was at the end of the third quarter 2,9 million customers linked by a contract of mobile telephony and 1,27 million CUSTOMERS DSL and complete subscriptions.
The Holding company of United Internet and Drillisch detained a direct participation in Freenet of 6,01 for one hundred up to now.
It was consequently admitted that Drillisch would bring about four out of one one hundred additional.
Right to buy 18,49 for one hundred investment companies Vatas had déja decided in August.
